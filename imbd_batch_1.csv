Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,63,"Once it gets going and commits to its time-worn inspirational formula, it's not half-bad."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,60,"Knuckleheaded though this faculty-member-turned-MMA-fighter comedy is, there's no denying the plot's lefty credentials, snuck in like Raisinets among the popcorn."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,60,"Like James in the ring, it doesn't pack a lot of power, but it comes out swinging and sweats for applause."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"So even if Here Comes the Boom doesn't quite work as a comedy (it's not particularly funny), or a drama (it's not particularly poignant), it has an earnest charm that keeps us engaged."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,Here Comes the Boom is stale and vanilla. We know we're in trouble early when the first joke fails.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"If you can choke down the implausible notion that the doughy Kevin James would last more than five seconds in a mixed martial arts ring, Here Comes the Boom is a moderately enjoyable, nontaxing sort of comedy."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"A farther-fetched fantasy: In addition to asking we believe our loosely packed academic can play Rocky, Here Comes the Boom imagines a world in which butterball Everyman Scott and the fabulously lush Bella (Salma Hayek) might argue and bill and coo and eventually fall in love."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,What's missing from this color-by-numbers screenplay is the bizarre touch of eccentric humor Sandler often lets creep into his comedies.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"The pure mechanics of Here Comes the Boom land it in an enjoyable, if forgettable, space."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"It's all harmless, if not entirely fun."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"Kevin James's latest comedy doesn't promise any bing or bang, only boom. Take it at its word."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,50,"A cloddish, harmlessly drecky comedy from the Sandler factory of crude mush."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,42,Cue 105 painful minutes of a fat guy getting punched in the face and falling down.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"Few people will be surprised by how it all unfolds or by how it all ends. This is a movie about lightweight entertainment and heavyweight fighters, not a movie about surprises."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"The film works hard at its inoffensiveness. Throughout, jokes are left on the table, setups never pay off in any significant way."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"Boom was produced under the auspices of pal Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions, which has a tendency toward broad-comic morality tales and multiplex populism that often shades into remedial-level pandering."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"All banality, though it delivers some goodwill even as it pulls a muscle trying to get its premise going."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,The first half hour of Here Comes the Boom is so good moviegoers might be fooled into expecting something better than an obvious wish fulfillment fantasy so patently implausible it's almost insulting.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,"Hands of stone meet heads of air in Here Comes the Boom, a sports story so daffy it may as well star Kevin James."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,40,Low on raunch but even lower on laughs. It also looks like half the lighting crew failed to show up.
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,38,"Loud, incoherent and unfunny, Here Comes the Boom is the sound of American culture imploding."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,38,"Here Comes The Boom seems to have made it from the pitch stage - Kevin James does MMA to save his school or something! - to the big screen without an iota of inspiration, ambition, or personality seeping in at any juncture."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,33,"""Here Comes the Bomb"" would've been a more fitting title, but props to Henry Winkler for rising to the occasion and turning in a sweet, idealistic performance in a film that otherwise feels like a tawdry commercial for the UFC and MMA."
Here Comes the Boom,6.4,45290318,20,"As a comedy, the film aims low and manages to miss the mark entirely."
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,70,"Iron Eagle is a very shrewd teen-age variation on the Rambo/Missing in Action formula, a military rescue movie with a nice young hero and a fun-loving feeling."
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,50,Director Sidney J. Furie fills in the rest with breakneck action and some dandy dogfights. Much of the dialog is simply laughable.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,50,Iron Eagle has an unintended hilarity that builds and builds. But don't take this as one of those so-bad-it's-good endorsements: The film is a total waste of time.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,40,A ridiculous rabble-drowser with the heart of a bully and the soul of a thief.
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,38,"It is regrettable that the highest of production values have been invested in this, the cheapest of stories."
Iron Eagle,5.4,24159872,38,"Yet another totally absurd bout of macho wish fulfillment for those frustrated by the American government and military's inability to deal effectively with terrorism, Iron Eagle is actually more outlandish than most."
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,70,It's precisely Seagal's incongruity that has made him a great absurdist hero -- and that makes Fire Down Below a kick.
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,50,"The star hasn’t lost his gift for making sadism seem impish. After a while, however, you may notice that the film’s mayhem is accomplished almost entirely through editing."
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,50,"Typical action fare for martial arts star Steven Seagal and, in his limited oeuvre, one of the more entertaining efforts. But the genre is pedestrian, and Seagal makes no new moves here in terms of screen personality or acting skill. What fun there is lies in the villains, some nifty stunts and a bouncy musical score rife with regional sounds."
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,50,"Like most Seagal movies, the violence is poorly choreographed, the clothes are bad, and you weren't going to see it anyway, were you?"
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,50,"The supporting cast is stocked with far better actors than Seagal -- Kristofferson, Harry Dean Stanton and Stephen Lang among them -- and country music personalities ranging from Mark Collie, Levon Helm, Randy Travis and Travis Tritt to Loretta Lynn's twin daughters Patsy and Peggy, to whom Seagal's character makes some vaguely suggestive remarks."
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,50,"Seagal fans will find that their hero is still in his usual form (his form, like his expression, hasn't wavered since he debuted in Above the Law). The action scenes are adequately directed (by Felix Enriquez Alcala, a TV director making the crossover to feature films), and there's a genuinely tense truck-and-car chase that is worth about 90 seconds of moderate excitement. The rest of the film is all by-the-book stuff, but that's what's expected whenever the name ""Steven Seagal"" tops the marquee."
Fire Down Below,5.0,16228448,50,"These thugs, needless to say, are pulverized as effortlessly as so many Easter chicks. This is a problem I've always had with Seagal's martial arts sequences; there's seldom a nanosecond of suspense, and the fight choreography has all the sophistication of Seventies drive-in fare such as Billy Jack and Walking Tall."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,91,"A singular look, an exemplary vocal cast, and a narrative arc like a caress. That'll be the Kung Fu Panda franchise's legacy, the idea that shouldn't have worked but did, beautifully and with its own chi."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,88,"I think the secret to the appeal of the entire “Kung Fu Panda” franchise is the enormous affection we feel for Po, that seemingly bumbling good guy who also can rise to the occasion and showcase true heroism and mystical power."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,88,"Martial-arts action, excitingly mounted, is all part of the package as Po battles a glowering, green-eyed bull (J.K. Simmons) and tries to whip peaceable pandakind into a fighting force to defeat the villain. One-liners fly as fast as kung-fu fisticuffs in this sweet and satisfying picture."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,88,"It's easy to mistake the simplicity of plot and theme here for simple-mindedness - this isn't Pynchon or Proust. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the economy of a Zen koan, not to mention its inner harmony and wisdom."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"The stakes are upped and character count doubled, but this doesn't mean attention to detail is spared. The visuals are sublime with different animation styles used to tell different stories."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"All the best parts of the movie are transitions and montages, jazzing up the video-game-ish plot with mock-heroic exuberance. The summer ahead is looking madly stuffed with talking animals, but Po has jammed his bulging frame through first, and done it with style."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Animated with exceptional depth and beauty by co-directors Jennifer Yuh and Alessandro Carloni (and given epic new heft by Hans Zimmer in the orchestra pit), it's a rare ’toon franchise that can grow up so quickly and still giggle at its own butt jokes."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Rather than the cynical ‘one last grab’ of the series, Kung Fu Panda 3 might actually be the best. Also, and this is so rarely the case that it’s worth mentioning, it deserves to be seen in 3D."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Mostly, Kung Fu Panda 3 is just fun."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"A beautifully rendered, lovingly constructed action-comedy that's sure to please kids and adults alike."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Lots of comedic fight scenes break up the story’s more somber stretches, and the animation, especially in 3-D, is simply gorgeous."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"It’s cohesive and cathartic enough to make a fourth entry unnecessary, but at the same time, it’s entertaining and gorgeous enough to make the prospect of same something to welcome."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,80,"Emotionally, dramatically and perhaps most of all visually (it’s worth seeing in 3D), this delightful trilogy capper is almost as generously proportioned as its cuddly warrior hero, restoring a winning lightness of touch to the saga while bringing its long-running themes of perseverance and self-knowledge to satisfying fruition."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"The stunning visuals in DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 3 surpass the high standards set by its predecessors, but storywise, the latest adventures of goofy Po the panda break no new ground."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"Directors Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni deploy a gorgeous color palette for the Chinese countryside, using vibrant, swirling shades of green, blue and red for the panda hideaway....The directors also make sure to let Po stay the charming bumbler he’s always been. That’s what makes him such an earnest, lovable hero."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"In spite of its abundant action — and for all the interspecies mashups, this is as much an action-adventure animated movie as it is a funny-animal animated movie — is a pretty relaxing experience for the adult viewer."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,Just complicated enough to reward steady viewers and just simple enough for parent escorts to enjoy without much prior knowledge.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,75,"It finds a benefit in its genre affiliation, evenly distributing its action in quick bursts of fluidly animated fight choreography."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,70,"If directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh don't reinvent the panda-as-martial-artist wheel, they avoid making the story seem stale. The terrific animation helps, of course."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,70,"While the storyline, in which Jack Black’s dumpling-downing Dragon Warrior is reunited with his biological father, doesn’t quite fulfill its prophecies, dramatically speaking, visually speaking it’s all quite impressive — one of those very rare animated features that completely justifies its 3D glasses."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,67,"This is a visually stunning picture, a rhapsody of saturated color and contrasting texture, from the painstaking detail of coarse panda fur to the painterly dreamscape that is the spirit world."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,63,"Like most sequels, it pacifies its core demographic by offering “more of the same.” To that extent, it can be said to be successful."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,63,"The movie's story and cute characters are geared toward the younger crowd, per usual. But while it lacks the wonder and nuance of earlier Pandas, there are enough new faces and wowing, Asian-influenced style to also keep parents amused for an hour and a half."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,60,This is a visually sumptuous kids’ film that will also charm adults.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,60,"Visually though, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a candy-colored 3-D treat."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,60,"Fitfully amusing and certainly heartfelt, this latest chapter in the likeable animated saga will work best with younger viewers, but its life lessons and emotional beats feel slathered on rather than deftly woven into the storyline."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,58,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is Kung Fu Panda minus a dramatic arc, but with way more pandas."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"From a sympathetic perspective, let me say that sequel No. 3 shows how difficult it is to keep these franchises fresh while remaining true to their initial charm."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"Plays as a franchise out of ideas, out of jokes and more naked about its real place in the film firmament –as panda pandering to the enormous Chinese movie market."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"In Hollywood’s franchise game, sequels are seldom the best they can be. This one isn’t, but it’s pretty, perfectly pleasant and good enough."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,A story that builds toward Po training an army of his panda brethren fails to deliver exponentially greater fun.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,"Kung Fu Panda 3 has a moment or two for everyone, but no chance develop any character beyond a single dimension."
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,50,The movie undercuts its own undercutting.
Kung Fu Panda 3,7.1,143528619,40,"Once upon a time, Black's charisma might have been enough to carry the movie."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,Manages to capture the pure heart and spirit of this comic book Americana.
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Boasts a smart screenplay by Robert Benton and David and Leslie Newman, striking cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (especially in the Smallville sequence), bright comic turns by Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman, and of course, that winning performance by Christopher Reeve in the title role. Believe a man can fly? You bet!"
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects, and -- you know what else? Wit."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Estimates of the movie's costs range between $35-and $70-million; whatever the price, it was not too much to pay. As gods go, Superman is one of the godliest; his movie is one of the best."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Magnify James Bond's extraordinary physical powers while curbing his sex drive and you have the essence of Superman, a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"A movie that is pure escape and good, clean, unadulterated fun."
Superman,7.4,134218018,88,"There's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made."
Superman,7.4,134218018,88,"Effective both as Superman and as the bumbling Clark Kent, Christopher Reeve still seems ideal for the part, if for no other reason than his ability to summon up a convincing sense of intensity when charged with saving the world."
Superman,7.4,134218018,83,"Despite a lull here and a lapse there, this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable, doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras -- Christopher Reeve."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"it's the simple, earth-bound quality of the film that makes this comic-book fantasy soar."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"Superman is a bastion of blockbuster innocence, a movie that’s a studio product, certainly, but also something that could have grown from one of Smallville’s sun-kissed cornfields."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"The film is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out into giggly camp--as it does, finally and fatally, when Lex Luthor enters the action; Gene Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit."
Superman,7.4,134218018,75,"Superman is good, clean, simple-minded fun, though it's a movie whose limited appeal is built in."
Superman,7.4,134218018,70,"A highly entertaining, though undemanding mixture, of sci-fi, romance and comedy, which could hardly have come off at all at any lower artistic level, nor without such a happy choice for the central part as Christopher Reeve."
Superman,7.4,134218018,70,The film allows naiveté and knowingness to coexist. Only when it goes all out for cold Batmanesque villainy in the second half does it narrow its focus and lose its way.
Superman,7.4,134218018,60,"The film burdens itself with too many story lines and an overlong (though beautifully photographed) prologue, but things really get moving when Reeve takes the screen."
Superman,7.4,134218018,60,"Superman doesn’t have enough conviction or courage to be solidly square and dumb; it keeps pushing smarmy big emotions at us—but half-heartedly. It has a sour, scared undertone."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,80,"Juicy, adroit, and likable."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,80,"This brilliantly naive, low-budget shoot-'em-up presents every action as if it were brand spanking new."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,78,"While the story may be a common one (for the action genre, at least), Rodriguez, who wrote, produced, shot and edited the entire film himself, has a uniquely straightforward wit that makes what might otherwise have been just another shoot-'em-up something more than that."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,75,Enormously entertaining.
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,75,"A gripping, tautly-paced action flick that outdoes most of Hollywood's similar output. This is clear evidence that film quality often has little to do with a production's budget."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,70,"Mythic pulp has its allure, and it also has its limitations. El Mariachi displays no real emotion except a profound appreciation for the genre film making that has inspired it, and a delight in manipulating the elements of such stories."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,70,"The unrelenting tempo is bolstered by Rodriguez's camera work and editing: nearly every frame seems to have been shot with a careening, handheld camera, and they're cut together in a skillful, fluid fashion that enhances the tension and pace of the 80-minute chase."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,70,"Spanish lingo crime meller has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir."
El mariachi,6.9,2040920,67,"Rodriguez makes the same mistake as other first-time auteurs: The world of this movie exists only in relation to other movies, particularly the Sergio Leone-Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns of the early '60s."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,100,"This is high, and high-wire, melodrama. It's less soap opera than grand opera, where matters of love and death are played at a perfect fever pitch. And grand this Golden Flower is."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,100,"It's a work by cinematic geniuses that reveals beauty and terror in a long-ago time with a virtuoso intensity. You won't soon forget its mad, lovely sights and sounds."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,100,"A dazzling costume epic, a spectacle for the eyes and for the soul."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,90,"A period spectacle, steeped in awesome splendor and lethal palace intrigue, it climaxes in a stupendous battle scene and epic tragedy."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,90,"Another remarkable chapter in the career of Asia's most important living filmmaker. After ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" this is the movie to see this season."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,90,"Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower is a kind of feast, an over-the-top, all-stops-pulled-out lollapalooza that means to play kitschy and grand at once."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,88,It's a lavish entertainment that revels in lurid colors and yet more lurid emotions.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,80,"Since his debut in 1987 with ""Red Sorghum"" Mr. Zhang has made more controlled films but never one that's more fun. With Curse of the Golden Flower he aims for Shakespeare and winds up with Jacqueline Susann. And a good thing too."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,Exhaustingly action-packed.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"It's more theatrical pageant than action movie, with the showy but rudimentary martial-arts action coming off like just another ritual with the players going through the motions."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,The Curse of the Golden Flower is the year's most operatic and visually lavish film.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,Director Zhang Yimou's ambitious attempt to blend martial arts action with Shakespearean melodrama. It's not a perfect marriage but it offers two hours of solidly over-the-top entertainment featuring incredible visuals and powerful performances by international icons Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"Chinese director Zhang Yimou has made some of the most beautiful movies of the last 20 years, and with his latest, Curse of the Golden Flower, he has also made one of the most deliciously nutty."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"Like a soap opera, but most of what glitters is gold."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"Action fans might find the film's first half somewhat of a slog to sit through because of its carefully honed exposition, while those used to Zhang's dialogue-heavy dramas are sure to be surprised by the film's brutal second half where blood spurts more than the words."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"The final effect is stunning, but also sadly impersonal."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"There are fine actors at work here. Chow is quiet and cunning, Gong Li is haughty and cold-eyed, Chen Jin is sturdy as a ghost who appears out of the past, and Gin Junjie is vividly bratty as the youngest, and most underappreciated, prince."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,75,"But as Western analogies go, Curse achieves an emotional fervor more in keeping with ancient Greek mythology than Elizabethan theater."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,70,"Like his ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers,"" Zhang Yimou's third global-market gigaproduction makes little sense in narrative terms even after two screenings, but the sets, costumes, and cinematography are so intoxicating that it doesn't much matter."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,67,"Few filmmakers could produce so grand a spectacle, but Zhang used to be good for more than just eye candy."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,67,"Curse of the Golden Flower is a watchable soap opera, but its marching-band martial-arts scenes are little more than weakly staged retreads of the ones in Zhang's ""Hero."""
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,63,"This colour-drunk, sumptuous late Tang Dynasty (928 AD) drama is huge on spectacle but as devoid of delight as a Cecil B. DeMille biblical epic."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,63,"As easy as this movie is to watch, it's artificially flavored. ""Golden Flower"" runs on crocodile tears and corn-syrup blood."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,60,"Zhang Yimou's strangest and most troubled film, abounds in hysterical, mannered Tang Dynasty-era palace intrigue and dehumanized CGI battle sequences."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,60,"In the end, Curse also looks alarmingly like a dry run for the opening and closing ceremonies Zhang has been hired to direct for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,60,"Imagine ""The Lion In Winter"" set at a Kylie gig. You can have too much of a good thing, but it is a good thing."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,50,"Curse of the Golden Flower could also be called ""Curse of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' "" In other words, it is yet another attempt to cash in on the success of Ang Lee's 2000 martial-arts epic, which will go down in the history books as one of the most overrated films of the decade."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,50,The movie has plenty to engage one's interest but little to sustain it.
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,50,"To question that this movie is a visual feast would be an act of real cynicism. But as the old Chinese proverb goes, ""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside."""
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,50,"In Curse of the Golden Flower, Zhang Yimou tries to top the breathtaking poetic spectacle of his masterpiece, ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and instead plummets into self-parody."
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,50,"I can say only three good things about his latest martial arts picture, the incoherent The Curse of the Golden Flower: 1) Gong Li deserves better roles, 2) The costumes are astonishingly beautiful, and 3) Ummm...wow, how about those costumes!"
Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia,7.0,6566773,30,"Zhang Yimou is seriously off his game with the utterly ridiculous Curse of the Golden Flower, a new epic that feels like ""Hero"" meets ""The Lion in Winter"" meets ""Peyton Place."" The film is worthless as a serious work of art, but it may offer the jaded viewer a surplus source of MST3K-inspired wisecracks."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,75,"The Rise Of Cobra holds to a thrill-ride sensibility that’s unchallenging and more than a little goofy, but exciting and consistently well-managed."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,70,"While thesping is not the main game here, having a cast of bright young things certainly helps, and Quaid gets in a few nice John Wayne-like moments as the no-nonsense boss."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,70,"The loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters (long and silly ""Transformers,"" flashy and loud ""Wolverine"")."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"A brazen, earsplitting, eye-popping, oddly satisfying action extravaganza, though it veers wildly off-target in its second hour."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"A loud but proficient slab of explode-o-rama summer blockbuster nonsense, perfectly entertaining if you like that sort of thing, extremely skippable if you don't."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"This movie’s sole purpose is to make teenage boys high-five each other, and it’s faithfulness to that concept makes the cartoon carnage almost endearing."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,60,"The action is mostly brisk and bracing and the battleground, particularly Cobra's headquarters -- a vast network of tunnels under the polar ice cap -- are wonderfully imagined, as are the futuristic machines at the Joes' disposal. Basically, the Joes are not bad, it's just that they could have been much better with a little less conversation, a little more action."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"It's hard to deny that the first two-thirds of G.I. Joe is an enjoyable film, especially when graded on the curve of lowered expectations. Compared to other big-budget movies out this summer, it's pretty mediocre."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"G.I. Joe may not be beefier, but it’s cheesier and less aggravating than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,""  the summer ’09 headbanger it most resembles."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"Unlike it's ""Transformers"" cousin, the story is appealingly straightforward, and the movie is chock-a-block with breathless action sequences."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"Chock full of high-tech action, with a lot of chasing and shooting and explosions."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,The plot feels both familiar and far-fetched.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,40,"Bond without the style and Team America without the bellylaughs. The moronic script and nonsensical plot are good for a snicker, though."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,38,"Certainly better than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" How so? Admittedly, it doesn't have as much cleavage. But the high-tech hardware is more fun to look at than the transforming robots, the plot is as preposterous, and although the noise is just as loud, it's more the deep bass rumbles of explosions than the ear-piercing bang of steel robots pounding on each other."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,38,More toy commercial than movie.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"The only collateral damage is in the audience, where, as you sit through the movie, you can feel your IQ drop minute by minute."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"After nearly two hours of nonstop mayhem, the film ends on a surprisingly muted note, though pains have been taken to make sure that the hoped-for sequel has been carefully set up."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show, Sommers hits his groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence that, in turn, leads to an underwater finale that’s absurdly overproduced, momentarily diverting, and then instantly forgettable."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"Loud, shiny, and critic-proof, this franchise launcher is basically Transformers minus the humanity. Dennis Quaid provides some ballast as grizzled patriarch to the troop of sexy young lock-and-loaders."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,25,"Don't go expecting an escapist night at the movies; go expecting to be cudgeled into numb, drooling submission."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,20,"G.I. Joe was not screened for critics, but that’s not because of its mindless action and nonsensical plot. It’s because G.I. Joe is the kind of movie that bludgeons the viewer into submission with its loud and constant barrage of sound and fury."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,12,"Formerly a real American hero, G.I. Joe is no longer a hero (it's a group) or American. (It's a multinational team of military superstars, though the way it does business, you'd feel safer with the Croatian navy on your side.)"
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,12,"I don't know what to say about the acting, writing and directing in G.I. Joe because I couldn't find any."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,10,"There's a way to do this kind of thing (Just witness Hasbro's other toy-turned-dumb movie franchise, ""Transformers""). G.I. Joe, though, hasn't got a kung fu-grip on what it is."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,10,"This pricey, juiceless pulp could never have been killed by critics, simply because it was already dead."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,60,It goes down like a canned but genial '80s comedy: Without fanfare or much nutrition; part of your balanced breakfast.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,50,"Kind of a drag when it resorts to frantic slapstick and tired action-comedy tropes, but modestly engaging during stretches that suggest the project would have worked better as an exuberant musical."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,40,Hilariously horrible when it isn't just plain awful.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,40,John Whitesell's extraordinarily witless movie operates as a checklist for cultural and racial clichés.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,40,Won't likely disappoint fans of men-in-drag comedy but doesn't offer much that's original or funny.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,33,"Lawrence's gender-bending jokes are played out, and his slapstick is wooden and slow."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,30,"About the only honestly funny thing in the movie is Faizon Love's uncredited performance in the Joe E. Brown role, as the school maintenance man who's immediately smitten with Big Momma."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,25,"Star Martin Lawrence, now the sole remaining element from the original ""Big Momma's House"" 11 years ago, looks pretty tired both in and out of makeup here."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,25,"Fresh or not, creatively merited or not, here it comes: the third installment of Martin Lawrence's big, dopey franchise."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,25,"A humorless mashup of ""White Chicks"" and ""Glee."""
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,20,Whoever demanded a third installment of Lawrence's mirthless mash-up of weak gags and cross-dressing horrors should be imprisoned and forced to watch it on repeat until they repent. Avoid.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,11,"The comic, his career now apparently in total free fall, tackles the (dual) role(s) so broadly (no pun intended) that it's just plain annoying."
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,10,A film so drained of entertainment or simple humanity it is difficult to relate to as anything other than industrial artifact.
"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son",4.4,37915414,10,"Starved of humor and energy, the interminable Big Mommas: Life Father, Like Son could force Lawrence and co-star Brandon T. Jackson undercover for real."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,88,"It has great action sequences, more than a splash of legitimately-funny humor, solid performances from engaging actors, and a script that doesn't demand much mental exercise."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,88,This exuberant Western is a crowd-pleaser that remains faithful to the genre while having a roaring good time sending up its conventions.
Maverick,7.0,101631272,80,"The first lighthearted, laugh-oriented family Western in a long time, and one of the nice things about it is, it doesn't feel the need to justify its existence. It acts like it's the most natural thing in the world to be a Western."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,75,"Succeeds, just barely, on the good will of its stars and the sumptuousness of its Western locations."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,75,"Fast, funny, full of straight-ahead action and tongue-in-cheek jokes, Maverick is Lethal Weapon meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. That combination won't win any prizes for originality, but it works like a movie mogul's dream and sets the summer-film season off to an unbeatable start."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,75,"The film offers us Mel Gibson as a new Bret Maverick, the Western gambler, as well as the old TV Maverick, James Garner, now playing a wry frontier sheriff. These two guys can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,75,"True deft wit is just plum missing from this good-natured, flat-footed, eager-to- please, tee-hee Western."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,75,"As an updated version of the old western TV show, it does a pleasant enough job."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,70,"There may be a plot somewhere in William Goldman's script, and there might even have been a structure, but Mel Gibson, James Garner and Jodie Foster are so highly charged, as they slide through riffs that have nothing to do with anything except their own enjoyment in being invited to the party, that it's magnetic -- at least for most of the time."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,70,"Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,70,"How the West was fun: Maverick is affectionate, amiable, eager-to-please, in a TV-movieish sort of way."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,67,"Little about Maverick lingers in the mind once the final image has faded from the screen. But it's cleverly crafted, and you can't help enjoying it even when you know it's manipulating you as brazenly as a poker dealer with tricky fingers and a well-stacked deck."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,67,"The plot is one the original writers would have been proud of and with Garner, himself, appearing it gives the film a seal of approval. A rare performance from Foster who is surprisingly funny and Molina giving a good supporting performance, it's an enjoyable family film."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,63,"Crammed with such big-name crowd-pleasers as Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, Maverick reaches for that Feel Good feeling. It settles for Feel OK."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,63,"Movies like this one - with its spoofy jokes, vacant characters and indefensible plotting - do nothing to keep the western form alive. Deal me out of this con game."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,63,"A financially successful exercise in target-marketing, but not much of a movie."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,63,"Alternately a celebration and sendup of cowboy conventions, the movie lingers over a stunning Western landscape only to be spurred on by the principals' inexhaustible supply of escapades. The burr under the saddle: There's just too much of everything."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,60,"Cynical and bloated, Maverick is a comic western whose high-powered cast does very little but looks damned fine doing it. Even fans of the vintage TV show may find it trying."
Maverick,7.0,101631272,60,"By the time Donner crowds his climactic poker game with a bevy of veteran Western character actors, decades of movie tradition have been reduced to window dressing, and Maverick leaves you hungry for the real thing."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,91,"The most consistently funny studio sequel in some time, and the rare blockbuster that actually delivers on what it promises."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,88,"It's all fab, baby, a kicky, wiggy sequel that scores on all levels, from the sexy to the sublime."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,"Give your brain the night off, and Myers will make you smile too."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,"As a character, Austin Powers hasn't worn out his welcome, exactly, but he has outlived his novelty."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,Places Myers firmly on the top rung of movie comics.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,78,"A collection of arbitrary sketches, bits and improvs jammed into a locker room-style variety show masquerading as some semblance of a narrative."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"Given the choice between a movie that's better structured and only half as funny, I'd take The Spy Who Shagged Me (or its predecessor, for that matter) any day."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"With its outrageous double-entendre, gonzo performances and appalling lack of restraint, the sequel is more than a guilty pleasure."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"Better than anyone dared hope: bigger, more inventive, and more frolicsome than its predecessor, with a grab bag of scatological gags that are almost as riotous when you think back on them."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"There's a rampant looseness to this movie, and it's subversively liberating."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,Turns out to be less than the sum of its wonderfully silly and bizarre parts.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"For my taste, too much of the new Powers looks like bad TV and sounds like old burlesque."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,There is an underlying likability to Austin Powers that sort of carries us through the movie.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"If it all seems a bit dizzying, it is, but there's plenty to enjoy."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"The repulsive turn of events erased all my good memories of the first half, and makes the movie hard to recommend to a normal human being."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"Too much of what The Spy Who Shagged Me has to offer is tired and derivative, and, when the various jokes and gags are tallied, there are many more misses than hits."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,A movie that's nearly as good as its publicity campaign.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,"At this point, the effect of Myers' one-man Sixties love-in already feels less shagadelic than just shagged out."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,Script just doesnt have it in terms of fresh narrative developments or individual gags.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,"After a while it becomes apparent that this movie is too eager to please, too willing to sacrifice its point of view toward its targets to sustain itself for the length of a feature."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,60,Several love beads short of its predecessor.  Intermittently hilarious comedy.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,60,"The satire is crammed with sexual and scatological humor; some may find this Rabelaisian and refreshing, while others will detect the end of civilization as we know it."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,50,Would be too long even if it were twice as funny. And that about sums up the movie.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,50,Kills whatever charm the first movie had by recycling its few serviceable parts.
TRON,6.8,33000000,100,"Here's a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun."
TRON,6.8,33000000,75,"The story is simple, as befits a movie that's more about visual flash, technical bravura, and ideas than plot and character development. TRON turns into an action-oriented endeavor, with characters attempting to make their way through the video game inspired landscape of the mainframe to the goal that will achieve victory."
TRON,6.8,33000000,75,"Tron's thematic overtures have a certain silly charm, enhancing rather than detracting from its core virtues. What really makes Tron work is an astonishing sense of design."
TRON,6.8,33000000,70,"Jeff Bridges seems to be the only one having fun, playing a videogame designer who gets sucked into a Day-Glo world of his own creation. It’s like Alice in Wonderland acted out on a kids’ Lite-Brite toy."
TRON,6.8,33000000,67,"Dazzling but lightweight epic about a young scientist kidnapped into a computer, where he battles an evil master control program that runs the place like an electronic fascist. Has some tantalizing moments, as when computer-generated characters debate the religious question of whether users really exist. In the end, though, it's squarely in the old Walt Disney tradition of anthropomorphizing everything in sight, only this time it's circuits (instead of cuddly animals) that look and talk like people."
TRON,6.8,33000000,63,"It's intelligently conceived (on a visual level, at any rate) and largely good fun. Steven Lisberger, an East Coast animator, directed the visuals, combining the actors and computer graphics with satisfying results."
TRON,6.8,33000000,60,"It is beautiful -spectacularly so, at times - but dumb. Computer fans may very well love it, because Tron is a nonstop parade of stunning computer graphics, accompanied by a barrage of scientific-sounding jargon. Though it's certainly very impressive, it may not be the film for you if you haven't played Atari today."
TRON,6.8,33000000,50,"A sympathetic but slightly clumsy rewrite of The Wizard of Oz, with a whizkid programmer (Bridges) trapped inside a computer world. The film boasts some impressive computer-generated animation, but for all its inventiveness, Tron never reaches a level of excitement commensurate with its effects budget."
TRON,6.8,33000000,50,"The best visual design in the world doesn't mean a thing unless there's someone around with a rudimentary sense of story. Jeff Bridges, playing the human hero sucked into the machine, has to carry the film's entire burden of charm and appeal; he seems to have freaked out under the strain, turning in some surpassingly weird, alienating work."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,63,"There's a genuine attempt in Gleaming the Cube to deal with the impact the loss of a brother has upon a likable, footloose teen-ager. Unfortunately, the conventions of the action-adventure/youth-flick genres prevail. The result is an exploitation picture with a little something extra--lots of awesome skateboard wizardry, culminating in a speed-of-lightning chase sequence, in which skateboards are pitted against cars."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,60,"The plot of Gleaming the Cube is far from original, but the skateboarding sequences are exhilarating and add a great deal of excitement to otherwise routine material."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,60,"Gleaming the Cube (the title refers to achieving the skateboarding equivalent of cosmic bliss) has an intrigue plot that is unremarkable, and it doesn't do anything terribly novel with the relationship between Brian and the policeman (Steven Bauer) who helps investigate the case. It becomes somewhat more interesting in exploring the Vietnamese community of Orange County, Calif., especially in its tinier details."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,"With the screenplay dabbling with too many issues and stereotypes, the characters are largely one-dimensional and the relationships unconvincing."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,A slight skateboard thriller that looks more like one of those Afterschool Specials on television than a bona fide feature film.
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,"Slater, who sounds as if he is trying to imitate Jack Nicholson, is the only character who has a shading of personality. His skateboarding buddies are funny, considering one needs a glossary to translate their dialog, while the Vietnamese are mostly sleazy cardboard figures."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,50,"Performances, plot and landings are nailed down, but there's not enough invention here for the film to achieve cult status."
Gleaming the Cube,6.2,2777280,40,"Clifford can muster no interest in the cardboard characters or absurd plot developments, which leaves Gleaming the Cube to limp along listlessly between indifferently filmed skateboard demonstrations."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,60,"Crispian Mills directs with zip, throwing things together with a breathlessness that largely distracts from the fact that, for a horror-comedy, Slaughterhouse Rulez is neither particularly scary nor especially funny. But it does have an amiable sort of charm."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,Mills stages the B-movie mayhem with gleeful abandon and geysers of blood.
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"The school isn’t specific enough and the horror isn’t weird enough: on both fronts, it’s so broad it could practically be a Norfolk waterway."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,This sloppy horror comedy under delivers on both shocks and laughs.
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"Showing more enthusiasm than aptitude, this earns ‘could do better if it tried’ on its report card — but it’s a strange enough genre mix to be vaguely worth a look."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"There’s nothing particularly awful about the film (title aside), but it never develops into the “Shaun of the Dead”-like social satire it strains to be."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,80,Transporter 2 really does deliver the goods.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,80,"This ridiculously entertaining sequel is that rare part deux that leaves you hankering for part trois. The action is, in a word, spectacular, but also playful, inventive and witty."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,80,Delivers a satisfying late-summer escapist treat.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,75,"In fact the sequel is a better film than the original, as if writer-producer Luc Besson had a clearer idea of what he wanted to do (and didn't want to do)."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,Slick kidnapping yarn starts off like a bat out of hell and never sags.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,Transporter 2 was directed by Louis Leterrier and he exemplifies a perfect style for this type of film by showing us the action without editing it to bits.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,That a movie can run on empty and still be so obscenely enjoyable is a pretty slick stunt in itself.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,Statham isn't the best thing in Transporter 2; he's essentially the only thing.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,"Chucks the laws of logic and physics out the passenger's-side window, and it's all the better for it."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,70,"The computer-enhanced vehicle chases look fake, but the hand-to-hand combat scenes are the best of the year."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,"Stands a triumph of stunts over plot, of style over substance--of the wool we pull over our own eyes. It's brainless, high-speed, popcorn fun."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,But certainly this is a movie for fans of Willis-style action with a little James Bond and probable instant obsolescence thrown in.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,"It busts the credibility meter early on, quickly becomes preposterous, and then really lets its imagination rip."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,63,"Loud, kinetic, unflinching action."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,60,"Purely shallow but never dull, the film wisely pushes the limits of absurdity to the extreme, making it easier to submit to its sheer camp."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,60,"Another all-kicking, punching, shooting and exploding dose of Besson born action, and Jason Statham proves that his action mettle in the first instalment was no fluke."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,58,"The greatest thing about the movie is Statham, a charismatic silent, deadly type who deserves to take the wheel behind a better franchise."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"When the spectacle turns ridiculous, the movie just becomes another big-screen video game."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"I just saw The Transporter 2 on the way home from the lobotomy clinic, and boy, is it enjoyable. What a difference a simple operation makes!"
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"Like a cross between ""Man on Fire"" and ""Bad Boys 2,"" this demolition derby delivers eye-popping action sequences that would make even the Roadrunner roll his eyes in disbelief."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"For high-speed action, eye-popping locales, and chopsocky fight-fests galore, watch The Transporter - on video."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,If you can get past the impossibilities it is a fun time at the movies.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,A sequel that makes it clear that the outrageous antics of the first movie had a one-time-only charm.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,Choreographer Corey Yuen's use of a fire hose is far more creative than anything in the stale kidnapper plot.
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"Jason Statham is back as the fast-driving, fast-kicking Frank Martin, but this sequel fails to deliver the charm of its predecessor."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,50,"The original movie's lean production complemented its pell-mell fights and car chases; here, third-rate CG effects make the strained action sequences look even more improbable."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,40,The only glimmer of actual characterization in the entire film comes – all too briefly – from Frank's old boss Inspector Tarconi (Berléand).
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,30,"If not precisely charismatic, Statham brings authentic athleticism and a certain cheeky presence to his lightly written role."
Transporter Extreme,6.3,43095600,25,"This stripped-down premise made the first ""Transporter"" fun: It's all about driving skills and choreographed fights, not logic. Even with so few requirements, Transporter 2 runs on empty."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,75,Into the Storm is as straightforward a disaster film as you're likely to find.
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,75,It's hard to imagine any movie ever topping this one's depiction of killer tornadoes laying waste to the Midwest.
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,75,"The found-footage disaster flick Into the Storm is “Twister’’ for dummies, but by no means is that an insult. The new film is enormous fun if you’re in the right mood."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,67,"Into the Storm captures the magnificence of tornadoes, their awful beauty when they set down, the devastation they wreak, and the enormity of their consequences. The film features a rich array of well-developed characters – including the storm itself – which makes it ever more involving as it unfolds."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,63,"Bring on the bread and circuses. Into the Storm features laughable dialogue, far-fetched situations, and generic characters played by actors who almost look like more famous stars. I still had a blast; and if you lower your resistance, you may too."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,63,"Not all of it makes sense, but for disaster movie fans, Into the Storm has enough destruction to go around."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,60,"Its story line and performances are no more than serviceable, but those terrible twisters are state of the art."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,60,"To give the film its full due, the people who made it — the writer, John Swetnam, and the director, Steven Quale — got wind of a genuine trend and ran with it. Everyone on screen is busy filming everyone else. It's a shakier-camera version of ""The Blair Witch Project"" in the era of YouTube."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,58,"The film barely services the main characters and their arcs, so there's really no room for the sort of delicate etching needed to make supporting characters live and breathe. The film is at its best when it embraces the goofy nature of disaster films in general, and when it gives the audience the red meat it craves so desperately."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,58,"Into The Storm is an uncanny valley disaster movie — not as consciously cheesy and cheap as something like ""Sharknado 2,"" but built around a similar equation of unreality and gratification."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"The structure and impressive effects of Into the Storm could keep viewers entertained on a rainy weekend evening but it’s the shallow, non-existent characterizations that keep it from working."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"This film is actually less menacing than marveling, though a disturbing opening scene in a storm-tossed van could fit right into Mr. Quale’s earlier work."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"One-dimensional characters play second fiddle to the main event. Given the large cast of faceless players, it's hard to care when a few get sucked into oblivion."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"If we don’t care a whit about the characters and their respective dilemmas, a multiple-vortex tornado ripping through a used car lot is just a multiple-vortex tornado ripping through a used car lot."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"Into the Storm plays like a special-effects demonstration in search of a movie, but you have to give it to the filmmakers: They take no half-measures."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"There are many instances of questionable logic in Into the Storm, but the most persistent is the film's unexplained assumption that tornado-hunting is a growth industry."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"As impressive as the effects can be, as effective as the blend of TV news helicopter POV shots, security camera footage, cell-phone video and storm chaser images mimicked here turn out, the human stories are given short shrift in this “spend our budget on effects” action picture."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,50,"As clumsy as Quale is with the sequences of people shouting exposition back and forth, or delivering teary Blair Witch-style goodbyes into a camera that would have died long before its operators, he handles the CGI action with breathless intensity."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"When you're pining for Bill Paxton and the relative emotional realism of Twister, you know you're in trouble."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"Its destructive setpieces may loose the odd popcorn kernel on to the multiplex carpet, but it's really just an effects reel: the weather – cloudy wisps turning to massive, fiery hellblasts – is considerably better developed than its quarry. Stick with Twister."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"Too cartoonish to be cathartic, and too ghoulish to be honest fun, Into the Storm is mostly a somewhat uncomfortable sit enlivened by occasional hilariousness."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,Into the Storm is at once one of the dumbest films you'll see this year and one of the scariest.
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"Once Quale and writer John Swetnam get their generic setup out of the way, they can loosen up and treat the tornadoes like the villains they are. The effectively simulated storms, with their massive wreckage, start to feel like monsters stalking the heroes."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,40,"The script by John Swetnam is rudimentary, with only the most minimal and pallid stabs at characterization... Nevertheless, once the funnel clouds begin swirling, Quale and his special effects team achieve some remarkably authentic and frightening moments."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,38,"Hollywood's latest entry in that tried-and-true genre, the disaster movie, is . . . well, it's like . . . a totally gnarly roller-coaster ride!"
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,38,"Nobody watches a disaster movie starring digital tornadoes expecting Oscar Wilde. But Into the Storm, directed with bland efficiency by Steven Quayle of ""Final Destination 5,"" reminds us that unless a movie establishes certain base-line levels of human interest, it runs the not-unentertaining risk of coming out squarely in favor of its own bad weather."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,37,"For all the movie’s grandiose annihilation, there also is action so absurd and emotion so saccharine that the likelihood of involuntary laughter is high."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,30,"At the climax of Into the Storm, colossal tornadoes make noise, blow things up, and go around in circles; that's pretty much all the film does, too."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,30,"Into the Storm can make it rain like nobody’s business, but when it tries to be smart, it comes out all wet."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,25,"If the film had been trimmed to 45 minutes of crazed storm-chasing and storm-fleeing, it might've been worth a matinee ticket. But as is, it's the sort of lazy late-summer idiocy you'd be wise to huddle beneath an overpass to avoid."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,25,"Many movies require us to turn off our brains, and many rely on clichés and/or coincidences. It takes a special kind of shamelessness to do both, and Into the Storm has that in spades."
Into the Storm,5.8,47602194,25,"Even within the spinning cylinder of mediocrity that is Into The Storm, there are some minor pleasures to be had. Those are mostly found in Walsh, who is probably best known for comedic supporting turns, but makes the most with what is nearly a leading man part here."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,"It's a movie of such jaw-dropping violence, wild improbability and dazzling style it overpowers all resistance."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,"Oldboy is a powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,Park's direction is flawless and Jung Jung-hoon's cinematography is stunning.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,Startling and amazing -- a cinematic hammer to the skull.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,90,"Whatever its oversteps and excesses (I do think Park ran a little amok with the computer gimcrackery), Oldboy has the bulldozing nerve and full-blooded passion of a classic."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,90,"Anguished, beautiful and desperately alive, Oldboy is a dazzling work of pop-culture artistry."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,90,"It's a work of art for sure, but a sadistic one. Oldboy is one of the year's best; it just isn't for everyone. If you're still interested, go for it."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,88,"As always with Park Chanwook, you just hold on and let him rip."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,88,"Once the picture gets into Hollywood's bloodstream, it could well prove to be as influential as John Woo's 1989 crime thriller, ""The Killer."""
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,88,"This hunt for revenge is really a quest for self-discovery. The story, acting and brilliant directing elevate Oldboy into a human struggle to know yourself and your place in the universe, and to live with that sometimes terrible knowledge."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"A wild, intensely cinematic ride into two men's burning desire to get even."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"The result is a powerfully visceral experience that justifies itself almost entirely on surface chops, with striking color composition and a complex sound design that elevates the story to an operatic scale."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"Obviously, this sort of taboo-flouting imagery isn't for everyone, but Park's vision is all of a piece."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"This is absolutely not a film for all tastes, but it's a masterpiece of pitiless power whose audacious, ambiguous climax strikes a note of insane romanticism as haunting as it is perverse."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"You will surely leave this movie shocked, shaken and surprisingly moved. And definitely stuck on that poor octopus."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"Its magnificence is that it takes itself dead serious. It's not entertainment, but it's sure a piece of toughness."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"While the climax is admittedly something of a letdown after all the build-up, it's a hopelessly, helplessly original film, all guts, no glory."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,78,"Regardless of how you look at Oldboy, it's unlike anything you are likely to have seen before."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,As mysterious as it is sinister.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,"More than anything else, Oldboy recalls Alfred Hitchcock with all restraint tossed to the wind, or Hitchcock's most obsessed devotee, Brian De Palma, at his most nastily inspired."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,"This nightmarish revenge drama from Korea is grueling, intense, cruel -- the very definition of extreme cinema."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,"This is a movie about draining, tenderizing and chopping up the audience emotionally."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,It says something when you come out of a film as weird and fantastical as Oldboy and feel that you've experienced something truly authentic. I just don't know what. I can't think of anything to compare it to.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,70,"It's just the kind of film that you'd expect a jury led by Quentin Tarantino to choose, a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,67,Oldboy has the fatal air of wanting so desperately to be a cult movie that it forgets to present itself as a coherent one.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,60,"Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It's an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,50,"Entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,50,"Despite its director's skill at staging trash with dash, Oldboy is too long and portentous to be an enjoyable B movie. The movie's self-seriousness short-circuits its sensationalism."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,50,There's a lot less here than meets the eye.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,40,"Put simply, in my humble opinion, Oldboy sucks."
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,50,Hanover Street is reasonably effective as a war film with a love story background. Unfortunately it's meant to be a love story set against a war background.
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,50,"Director Hyams tries desperately to evoke the feel of the best of the 1940s wartime romantic dramas but, despite solid performances from the leads, his screenplay is predictable and trite, leaving the audience little to look forward to."
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,40,"Every now and then a film comes along of such painstaking, overripe foolishness that it breaks through the garbage barrier to become one of those rare movies you rush to see for laughs. The clichés were everywhere, but always just slightly out of place and inappropriate."
Hanover Street,6.1,3000000,20,Gung-ho American World War II bomber pilot falls for an already married English rose during teatime rendezvous in war-torn Hanover Street. Anaemic and foolish.
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,88,"What makes the movie special is how it's made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too - quirky and funny."
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,88,Together Cates and Hammond take a thrill-a-minute trip through the San Francisco underworld and along the way develop one of the 1980s' more interesting cinematic buddy pairings.
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,80,"That the fact they come to appreciate one other, the grudging respect of a million clichés, feels so satisfyingly, shows just how successful the film is."
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,80,"Walter Hill, the director of such beautiful but stilted tough guy movies as ''The Warriors'' and ''The Long Riders,'' has attempted something very different in 48 Hours a male-buddy action film that's positively witty and warm-hearted compared with his other work."
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,75,"The film is still an entertaining and invigorating thriller, with a structure and some curious sexual overtones that suggest Howard Hawks's ""A Girl in Every Port."""
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,70,48Hrs. is a very efficient action entertainment which serves as a showy motion picture debut for Eddie Murphy.
48 Hrs.,6.9,78868508,70,"Neither jokes nor fast, flashy action can completely distract audiences from the failure to establish an authentic, rather than a purely conventional connection between Nolte and Murphy."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Rian Johnson’s film is the real deal, a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"While there are some solid nuggets of deep-cut easter eggs for hardcore fans, what is so extraordinary about The Last Jedi is that this is the first post-Lucas Star Wars film that feels free to dance to its own beat."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"It’s not a perfect movie, but it may be a great one."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Like many before it, The Last Jedi has already been hailed as the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, and while that’s true, it’s too faint a compliment. It’s a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi launches the franchise to another level of action and humor thanks to incoming writer-director Rian Johnson, whose imagination seems boundless as George Lucas’ 40 years ago."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"An excellent middle chapter bursting with wit, wisdom, emotion, shocks, old-fashioned derring-do, state-of-the-art tech, and stonking set-pieces."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Easily its most exciting iteration in decades — the first flat-out terrific “Star Wars” movie since 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back.” It seizes upon Lucas’ original dream of finding a pop vessel for his obsessions — Akira Kurosawa epics, John Ford westerns, science-fiction serials — and fulfills it with a verve and imagination all its own."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Sure, it’s just a space Western, but “Star Wars” is one of the our most popular modern mythologies. Johnson respects that. He’s infused the storyline with new energy and artistry, and I can’t wait to see it again."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Writer/director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a sprawling, incident- and character-packed extravaganza that picks up at the end of “Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens” and guides the series into unfamiliar territory. It’s everything a fan could want from a “Star Wars” film and then some."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"A triumph of comic irreverence and dramatic purpose, Episode VIII dazzles like the sci-fi saga hasn't in decades."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,It’s less Star Wars as you’ve never seen it than Star Wars as you’ve never felt it.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,97,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the quintessential Star Wars movie. It embraces everything in the franchise that came before while taking big risks to push the story into new and unexpected places.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,93,"The movie is smart, stirring and deeply exciting, but more than anything, it is surprising. This is a Star Wars movie that plays with your assumptions and upends them, but it never betrays the story, characters and ethos at the series’ core. It expands the idea of what a Star Wars movie can be. It’ll knock you over."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,91,"Under the fastidious guidance of writer-director Johnson, The Last Jedi turns the commercial restrictions of this behemoth into a Trojan horse for rapid-fire filmmaking trickery and narrative finesse. The result is the most satisfying entry in this bumpy franchise since “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"No matter how much money has been poured into a movie, it’s emotional generosity that matters, and Johnson gives without squandering. His great gift is that he knows when to stop."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The new Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is shockingly good."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"What’s important in The Last Jedi is what happens to, and what we find out about, all of these characters along the way. In retrospect, The Force Awakens feels like a short introduction to these characters. After The Last Jedi, I feel like I’ve gone on a week-long road trip with them all."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever)."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is striking, stunning, visually hypnotizing, thrilling - everything ""epic"" about the famed franchise rolled into a tremendously overcharged start to Rian Johnson's Star Wars career."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The Force is, to me, still silly Star Wars mumbo jumbo, but Johnson finds a way to underscore it with humanity, with a classical Greek rumble of true pathos. On that front, The Last Jedi is a pure success, accessing the molten core of its drama and grappling with it in nuanced ways."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The space battles and lightsaber duels are appropriately exciting, but Johnson keeps a close eye on the human element that girds this galactic odyssey. Rather than simply regurgitating Star Wars’ past, The Last Jedi emphatically builds on it."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The new movie truly passes the torch by making the next generation of Resistance heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and new addition, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) — every bit as compelling as the old guard. Even more surprising, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) evolves from the whiny brat in “The Force Awakens” to a three-dimensional menace."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"There are images in this movie that provoke awe and delight, and creatures that feel lifted out of half-remembered childhood dreams. And though it briefly appears to lose steam in the middle, that’s short-lived, with a third act harboring sequences that feel like a maestro conducting a concerto the size of the cosmos."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,89,"While Abrams peddled name recognition, Johnson understands that the classic characters have to reignite the torch before they can pass it on, and gives both Leia and Luke defining moments."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has more than enough action, humor and stuff blowing up to thoroughly satisfy fans of the long-running franchise."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"The Star Wars universe is the best toy box a fanboy could ever wish for, and Johnson makes sure that Jedi is bursting at the seams with knockout fun surprises, marvelous adventure and shocking revelations that will leave your head spinning."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,Last Jedi is deep. It’s also rollicking. It’s right up there with the very first “Star Wars” in terms of its enjoyability factor. It’s a triumph.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Much will be resolved by the final chapter of the trilogy, to be directed by Abrams. As much as I enjoy his brand of canny populism, I prefer Rian Johnson’s wilder, generous, far-flung imagination."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"The Last Jedi tries to do a little too much in its overlong 2½ hours, yet writer/director Rian Johnson still turns in a stellar entry that owes much to George Lucas’ original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound. As is the case with all of the “Star Wars” films, where there is evil there is heroism, and where there is bravery there is sacrifice — and sometimes where there is love, there is heartbreak."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"If having pure fun at a “Star Wars” movie is wrong, I don’t want to be right. So for me, The Last Jedi falls right behind “The Empire Strikes Back” and maybe the original film in providing the thrills and the heartbreak, the heroism and villainy, and the romance and betrayal that makes these films such a treat even for those of us who can’t name all the planets or the alien species or even the Empire’s flunkies."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"By the rousing final act, Johnson has brought an apocalyptic grandeur to the lightsaber duels and airborne combat. His often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma—and the texts—of the old way."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,The film simply drags too much in the middle. Somewhere in the film’s 152-minute running time is an amazing 90-minute movie.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"Audiences will likely come away from The Last Jedi with a lot of complaints and questions. But they’re at least likely to feel they’re in the hands of someone who cares about the series as much as they do, someone who loves its history, but sees the wide-open future ahead of it as well."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,Rian Johnson’s main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"“Star Wars” has always been about destiny, fate, and legacy. However, perhaps like no film in the franchise yet, The Last Jedi seriously considers the hubris that comes with certainty, and how knots from the past that can keep you bound from moving forward."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,"The Last Jedi checks off all the boxes you want from a Star Wars movie, including one of the coolest lightsaber fights in the series’ 40 years, but Johnson is also interested in exploring new territory, including a consideration of the shadings and nuances to the Light and Dark Sides of the Force."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,"If The Force Awakens raised a lot of questions, The Last Jedi tackles them head-on, delivering answers that will shock and awe in equal measure. Fun, funny but with emotional heft, this is a mouth-watering set-up for Episode IX and a fitting tribute to Carrie Fisher."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It’s a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe – a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has. And there is no provisional hesitation or energy dip of the sort that might have been expected between episodes seven and nine.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"By breaking down some of the old mythology, Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a “Star Wars” film feels forward-moving."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the eighth movie in the series and one of the better ones. I’d rank it behind “The Empire Strikes Back” (still by far the best) and the first film, but it’s about on par with the enjoyable last episode, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which also awakened the long-moribund franchise."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"The Last Jedi is a film of moments. There are perhaps a half-dozen of them: goose-pimple inducing, fist-pump encouraging, heart-racing bursts of cinematic satisfaction. The problem is that the narrative threads connecting them are lazily knitted and sometimes tangled or broken."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi unspools like a one-movie binge watch, a lively if overlong and busily plotted second chapter to the latest Star Wars trilogy that advances the story and deepens its characters with a combination of irreverent humor and worshipful love for the original text."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"You don’t see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it’s all about and whether any of it was worth it. It’s this element that gives The Last Jedi an extra something, a fascinating melancholy undercurrent."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"These sequels trade directly on the emotional legacy of the originals (The Last Jedi makes some leaps into sentimental hyperspace, particularly in the way that it handles Fisher on-screen), and the more of the aged Luke and Leia we see, the more we chip away at the mythic power of characters as Lucas left them: Young, strong, immortal."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"For all its strengths, The Last Jedi is a very manic film, fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Does the movie, like its predecessor, rely on familiar tropes a bit more than it should? Yes, I think it does. Is it, at a solid two-and-a-half hours, considerably longer than it needed to be? Yes, that too. But it’s still a pretty damn good movie, arguably the best the franchise has offered since Empire."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"While Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good movie and a worthy entry, it would have been stronger if Johnson didn’t telegraph those new directions before leading us to them."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"A narrative that mixes, not always successfully, stirring moments and sensational action with angst and grim conflictedness on a galactic scale."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Although The Last Jedi meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson’s effort is ultimately a disappointment. If anything, it demonstrates just how effective supervising producer Kathleen Kennedy and the forces that oversee this now Disney-owned property are at molding their individual directors’ visions into supporting a unified corporate aesthetic."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be, writer-director Rian Johnson's plunge into George Lucas' universe is generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,63,The latest entrant in this now-Disney-owned franchise is largely content to further the themes and narrative strategies of J.J. Abrams's predecessor.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi yokes Johnson’s formidable cinematic intelligence to an elaborate feat of fan service that feels, above all, like the rhetorical and dramatic gratification of a religious sect."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Ridley, full of charming spunk playing a skeptical rebel recruit in The Force Awakens, is the biggest disappointment here. She is less engaging now that she is committed to the fight and plays most of the later action on a single note of earnest desperation; Johnson's script leaves her little else."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Intentions and inspiration aside, Last Jedi doesn’t add up to an “Empire Strikes Back” for this trilogy. There’s no romance, little pathos and no real punch-in-the-gut moment. Its emotionally sterile tone was set with “The Force Awakens,” and that’s proven hard to shake, new innovations and plot twists aside."
Commando,6.7,35100000,70,"In Commando, the fetching surprise is the glancing humor between the quixotic and larky Rae Dawn Chong and the straight-faced killing machine of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Chong lights up the film like a firefly, Schwarzenegger delivers a certain light touch of his own, the result is palatable action comics."
Commando,6.7,35100000,63,"Though not as good as Terminator, the film has a better-than-usual script for this sort of thing and shows a lot of humor. Schwarzenegger isn't especially good as an actor, but his presence is impressive, and he is beginning to show some style, if not much substance. For action fans, one of the picks of the litter for the year."
Commando,6.7,35100000,63,"Comic book stuff, helped out by the presence of Rae Dawn Chong as an airline stewardess whose sarcastic commentary adds some comic counterpoint to the deliberately overscaled action."
Commando,6.7,35100000,60,Two-thirds of this 90-minute film is mayhem unrelieved by humor and untouched by humanity.
Commando,6.7,35100000,50,"Lots of machine-gunfire, explosions and disposable khaki-clad extras, as you'd expect."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Not only is Fallout the best Mission: Impossible film by a considerable margin, it is also undoubtedly the best action film of the year."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,Cruise and McQuarrie have made the best film in the franchise’s history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie in several years.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"It’s got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it. This is one of the best movies of the year."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Unlike many of his action-cinema contemporaries, McQuarrie excels at creating clear lines of sight for his set pieces, and cutting them together to ensure maximum tension."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie borrows just the right amount of familiar spy tropes in his second “M:I” outing, and his film, while intelligent and witty, never becomes too self-serious or chatty. It’s the best night out at the movies so far this summer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"McQuarrie also builds on the last film’s self-aware level of wit and, most importantly, its set-piece-crafting sophistication. No action sequence is allowed to peter out, or be chopped to ribbons in the edit, or lean on the crutch of CG augmentation."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"A combination of thrilling stunts, insane daring and clever writing make this a stunning piece of action cinema. Just be sure to take your heart meds first, and hold on tight."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"McQuarrie brings grace and grit, and Cruise brings it, period. This quick-witted, fleet-footed franchise shows no sign of flagging."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"He’s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be — or maybe he’s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he’s always promised us, and it was totally worth the wait."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma’s sweat-drop precision, John Woo’s craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Simply put, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the best action movie you will see this year. You’ll probably leave the theater overcome with an urge to go jumping from building to building."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"It’s the kind of pure, straight-no-chaser pop fun that not only keeps taking your breath away over and over again, it restores your occasionally shaky faith in summer blockbusters."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is not a triumph of literal realism, orderly plotting, or restraint, but it’s proof that thoughtful execution, comedic timing, and a true moral center count for much more."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"Moving like the lit fuse that blazes brilliantly across the opening credits of both the original Mission: Impossible television series and its first big-screen adaptation, Fallout turns out to be a breathlessly exciting action spectacular: the blockbuster spy thriller as sustained endorphin rush."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,Mission: Impossible - Fallout merges the franchise’s big-budget spectacle with an utterly ferocious style of action filmmaking that far surpasses what McQuarrie executed in either Rogue Nation or Jack Reacher.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"McQuarrie has proven himself such a keen purveyor of large-scale cinema that not only solidifies Fallout as a benchmark for the franchise, but a bona fide manifesto for breathtaking, high-stakes action–a mission that the genre as a whole would do well to accept."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"To be fair, you can scoff at the antics and still be swept away. The final quarter of Mission: Impossible—Fallout takes place in Kashmir, with a helicopter chase through deep gullies and past snowy peaks. McQuarrie keeps the action crisp and clear, to match the icy air."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"This episode is something special, because the dance is so smashingly gorgeous."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"There’s a whole lot of everything in the Mission: Impossible — Fallout, an entertainment machine par excellence that skitters around the world and has something to do with nuclear bombs, mysterious threats and dangerous beauties. Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"As these films have gone on, they’ve become more and more fascinated with Hunt’s essential ludicrousness. Mission: Impossible – Fallout decrees him elemental—a crucial, indefinable component keeping the very fabric of humanity knitted together. The film is so dizzyingly fun that, at least while you’re watching, it seems like a sound conclusion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"It’s not just “Impossible,” it’s irresistible."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"A cinematic centrifuge of acrobatic stunt work, breakneck chases and immersive action, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a perfectly calibrated piece of filmmaking that plays the viewer like a drum right from the start."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense. He places audiences just over Cruise’s shoulder, or staring into the actor’s face as he grimaces with exertion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. Fallout is a testament to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who gives the proceedings a witty, sophisticated grandeur, and yet the film belongs to Cruise and his seemingly limitless passion for putting himself and his audience through the wringer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"In ragged times, the sophisticated derring-do of Fallout is a welcome gift, a slick and studio-polished adventure that nonetheless has the undermining wink of transgression. The movie’s nerve and moxie successfully make us forget its corporate overlords, and all those other oligarchs grinding millions of American lives into nothing."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"Even as the narrative becomes more perplexing — as before, realistic masks conceal true identities, characters' actual agendas remain hidden — the fast-moving spectacle unfolds in extraordinary fashion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"After two decades, Fallout might be the finest film in the series. (To me, it’s a toss-up between this and Ghost Protocol.) Either way, Mission: Impossible is clearly the best ongoing action franchise in the world. And nothing else even comes close."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"“Fallout” just might be the best of the franchise, and what a rare thing that is for a long-running series."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Mission: Impossible — Fallout is definitely everything we expected, and more. You might need to go lie down afterward, in a good way."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Mission: Impossible — Fallout, is everything a summer action pic should be — a delirious procession of stunning stunts, epic brawls, state-of-the-art car chases and ticking clock countdowns."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Some of it’s pleasingly old school in its reliance on formidable stunt work. Enough of it, though, gets a digital effects assist for the amazements to scale the heights of plausibility and then leap, like a gazelle, to the adjacent mountain of sublime ridiculousness."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,85,"McQuarrie’s sense of building a scene on the barest of elements, communicating the most empirical of information, is so breathlessly impeccable, the plot barely seems to matter aside from creating easily understood stakes and giving Ethan Hunt a reason to keep, in the parlance of the film, figuring it out."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,85,"Fallout is the boldest of a series that has set a very high (sometimes literally so) standard for breathtaking set-pieces. By my count, the new film has at least seven of them—a generous gift to summer audiences from daredevil star Cruise, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,83,"Mission: Impossible knows exactly what it needs to be: a fun and chummy thrill ride that’s always self-aware. Fallout follows that agenda, while also revisiting its more severe roots. It’s a sequel in every sense of the word, reintroducing not only familiar faces, but styles, themes, and motifs of past films."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Genre convention means it’s a foregone conclusion that this mission is not, in fact, “impossible”, but director Christopher McQuarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Mission: Impossible—Fallout may be the best Mission: Impossible movie since the first, made in the dawn of the cat-Internet age, 1996, by Brian De Palma. Or perhaps it’s just the one with the mostest: even by the franchise’s extravagant standards, Fallout throws off Hope-diamond levels of grandeur."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Whether it’s the next in a long line or a summation of a fun series, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a movie that all but defines escapism at its finest."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"His sixth Mission: Impossible movie, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, isn’t the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol), but it’s easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it’s nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar!"
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"In addition to the absurd stunts and convoluted plot machinations, what makes the Mission: Impossible movies work in general, and Fallout in particular, is that they let their characters be characters, driven by a number of complex factors, even when they’re chasing an enemy or trying to get out of a scrape."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"The practical effects, meaning the real stuff the computer never touched, make all the difference when you’re asking audiences to see the characters as human instead pawns in a digital game."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"This is a film that wants you to live in the moment, to enjoy what is on screen when it is there in front of you and not worry how it fits into a plot that can be confusing but clears up in time for the inevitably rousing conclusion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is a worthy addition to the franchise and a fast pace thrill-ride.  McQuarrie manages to keep the story, stunts, and structure fresh."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"At nearly two and a half hours, it’s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies — violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action — but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,78,"A relentlessly entertaining exercise in putting Cruise’s Ethan Hunt through his paces again. And again. And again. But hey, there’s much pleasure in watching him continually fall off things."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,77,Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a fun but very familiar entry in the long-running franchise.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"As summer franchise movies go, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is near the top of the heap."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Given all the on-screen risk-taking, Mission: Impossible - Fallout plays it pretty safe. What you get is essentially an action movies greatest hits package."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"The result is a film that won’t make a dent in cinema history but, with an ebullient gusto, it is impossible to resist."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Although perhaps a little too long and not as tightly plotted as Rogue Nation, Fallout offers everything a viewer could reasonably expect from a Mission: Impossible production. It’s reliable."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Not just one of the best but, at its best, an exercise in pure action-movie propulsion and an essay in how to get from Point A to Point B in the most ingenious and exhausting way imaginable."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Much ink has been spent analyzing this enduring phenomenon called Tom Cruise, and what motivates him, onscreen and off. “I just want to entertain people,” he said recently. That’s one mission he can still nail."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"[Cruise] makes the movie fun to watch with his age-defying eagerness and death-defying stunts that bring a reasonably human scale back to blockbuster action, benumbed of late by the low-stakes digital fakery of special-effects movies."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"While the movie on the whole isn’t quite the caliber of the last two missions (“Ghost Protocol” and “Rogue Nation”), director Christopher McQuarrie’s action-packed “Fallout” set pieces are outstanding, finding great character moments in the middle of the explosiveness"
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"While some are hailing Mission: Impossible — Fallout as something truly special, I wouldn’t go quite that far. It does, however, offer as many thrilling dance numbers—I mean, action sequences—as any of the other installments."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Even its most irritating parts don’t fatally damage a whole that works amazingly well, despite its own excesses."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"There’s a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,70,"For a massive summer tentpole, Fallout’s pleasures are gratifyingly straightforward, direct without being dumbed-down. It’s a meat-and-potatoes banquet, one that doesn’t need to be interesting to be satisfying."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,70,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is cocked, locked and ready to blow you away with more than just Henry Cavill's forearms."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,60,"Over two-and-a-half hours, you get a lot of deafening bangs for your buck, and the tourist location stunts are impressive - but there isn’t as much humour in the dialogue as before."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,50,"As in Rogue Nation, Fallout‘s action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,80,"Exceptionally well-made family entertainment, this 3 Ninjas is constantly inventive, action-filled and funny, with a flourish of good special effects."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,58,"The incredible silliness doesn’t quite erase the bad taste of this kid’s movie featuring an implied dozen civilian casualties, but it helps."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,50,"Pathetic yet stupidly entertaining for several minutes of its interminable running time, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain makes half its cast look like retreads and half like fresh ponies desperately karate-kicking a dud script to see if it has any signs of life."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,40,"For most moviegoers over 12, this, the fourth Three Ninjas movie, will be interminably boring. But it's possible that young children will enjoy the film, since it falls into both the action category and the children-are-smart-adults-can't-do-anything-right genre."
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,38,Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness in 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain.
3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain,2.8,375805,30,The best you can say is that it's all pretty harmless and pretty stupid.
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,91,"The Planet of the Apes films had always been political, but with Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, things got angry. And it was awesome."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,70,"The Planet of the Apes series takes an angry turn in the fourth entry, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,60,"An allegorical fable of fascism and slavery, CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is the best of the four sequels in the hugely successful APES series, as well as being the darkest and most violent."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,50,"It's not bad, as apes and 20th Century-Fox go, at least hand in hand."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,40,"Wringing the last drops out of the idea, it strains to stay on-side, but it remains true enough to the spirit of the series to get it over the line."
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,6.1,9000000,30,"Dismally lurid stuff, ham-fistedly directed and low on credibility."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,80,"Unlike Burton, Schumacher doesn't let his stylistic and thematic fascinations run away with him; he keeps one hand on the wheel at all times. The result isn't as emotionally daring and visually outrageous as Burton at his best, but it's better paced and more consistently entertaining from one sequence to the next."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"Schumacher's method is to use a lighter touch, to stay closer to the cartoon that Bob Kane created for DC Comics in 1939 and to temper Burton's nightmare world with an accessible, brightly colored TV palette."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"It's an art-direction, Dolby-sound, special-effects extravaganza, a grand-scale effort that's more awe-inspiring than completely successful as entertainment."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"Although the film's frenetic rhythm is reminiscent of an ""Indiana Jones"" picture, visually Schumacher directs it like a musical, turning each image into eye candy, weaving one lush set piece into the next, as if he were the Vincente Minnelli of blockbusters."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,70,"If the first two ""Batman"" movies (1989/1992) were the storm, then Batman Forever (1995) is the rainbow at the end of it. After seeing so much dark and doom, it’s also refreshing to see some beaming color."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,70,"Working as much like a circus ringmaster as a director, Joel Schumacher has brought several critical qualities to the mix, starting with much more of a pop culture sensibility and a sense of fun than Tim Burton, who directed the first two pictures, and he has a stylish visual sensibility as well."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"There is no rhythm to the movie, no ebb and flow; it's all flat-out spectacle."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"At best, Batman Forever is mildly diverting, brainless fun that feels like a long trailer for a better film."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"Carrey lights up an otherwise over-scripted, over-frenetic potboiler."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"Sometimes thrilling, but rarely inspired, it is thoroughly-almost perfectly-adequate."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"Yet while Schumacher has largely accomplished the goal of delivering a cinematic comic book, he's also left the movie hollow at its core -- a distinction that may not trouble Saturday-night audiences but that nonetheless dulls the film's impact beyond its sheer and unrelenting visual grandeur."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"As for the actual movie, it's the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal (another Batman tie-in), so clearly a product that the question of its cinematic merit is strictly an afterthought."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Except for the casting, it would be difficult to find any substantial difference between this movie and the previous ones, or this movie and any number of high-tech adventure movies of the last decade."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Directed by Joel Schumacher with occasional gestures toward social commentary, and enough spectacle to mask the movie's deep down emptiness."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"The movie does have somewhat more lilt and levity, much of it due to Jim Carrey as the Riddler. But there's still plenty of murk, physical and metaphysical, and more psychobabble about Bruce Wayne's obsessions and repressions."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Alas, Schumacher doesn't ride on the momentum; worse, he's not an action director, and the film grinds to a dead stop every time it tries to speed up."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,There's so much and so little going on here simultaneously that you're not sure whether to squirm or doze.
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"Director Joel Schumacher submits to the Wagnerian bombast with an overly busy surface, and the script by Lee and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman basically runs through the formula as if it's a checklist."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"If you can see beyond the eye-scorching neon and don't mind the desecration of a superhero icon, there's a few crumbs of enjoyment to be had."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"Schumacher's direction is coarse and slovenly: the picture has the self-conscious jokiness of the ""Batman"" TV series and the smudged, runny imagery of a cheaply printed comic book."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,20,The only thing Schumacher and his scrupulous craftsfolk forgot to give the movie was life -- the energizing spirit of wit and passion that makes scenes work and characters breathe.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"While the villains are standard issue evil, Wonder Woman is remarkable in the genre for its early 20th century setting and Gadot's galvanizing performance."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"Wonder Woman is smart, slick, and satisfying in all of the ways superhero films ought to be. How deliciously ironic that in a genre where the boys seem to have all the fun, a female hero and a female director are the ones to show the fellas how it’s done."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"Wonder Woman is as much about a superhero rising as it is about a world deserving of her, and Diana’s hard-won insistence on battling for humanity (no matter how frequently they disappoint) adds the kind of gravitas and emotion that establishes it as the very best film the DCEU has made yet. There’s only one word for it: wonderful."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"Caught up in the coils of Princess Diana’s hot lasso, I am bound to tell the truth: Wonder Woman is wonderful, and the Woman herself, as played by Gal Gadot, is the dazzling embodiment of female empowerment. She is also learned, charmingly funny and, for a goddess, touchingly human."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"Wonder Woman emerges as not only the strongest movie in the present DC cycle, but also the first one that feels like an enveloping, honest-to-God entertainment rather than a raging cinematic migraine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"We get it, and DC finally should, too: Superhero movies can be fun. And Wonder Woman is a movie that'd send even the Suicide Squad home smiling."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"In the recent flood of superhero movies, several have managed to be quite good — but Wonder Woman ranks as one of the few great ones."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"While having a female director perhaps gives Wonder Woman a subtly different perspective, the real strengths of this production are its lead actors, the period piece setting, and an unexpected emotional resonance that one doesn’t expect from a popcorn movie."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"Diana’s a superhero without a chip on her shoulder; she was raised in love, and Gadot lets that belief shine through her eyes. You’re both drawn to this woman and in awe of her."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"Director Patty Jenkins’ origin story is packed with heart and empathy, and we have Gadot’s endearing performance to thank for that — but it’s also a byproduct of the timeline."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"A genuinely surprising film that plays with genre and throws out the now very tired superhero movie formula. It’s an action film, a romantic comedy and a coming-of-age story and a period piece and a war movie all in one. Above all, it’s a hopeful story about humanity."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"For the first time in a long time, I came out of a DC comic book movie feeling ready for a sequel. It feels right, at this actual historical moment, when men made of something less than steel are bumbling around trying to run things. Paging Paradise Island!"
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,87,"Wonder Woman represents a number of delicate balancing acts: between humor and gravitas; angst and adventure; full-blown, unvarnished superhero fantasy and the DCEU’s usual unpacking of what those fantasies mean."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"At times, Wonder Woman feels like watching Splash with a shield — another babelicious naïf breaking all the rules. Yet the joke isn't on her. It's on all the men mistaking unsophistication for weakness. To be uncultured is to be mentally free; no one's put on a yoke. That's what makes Wonder Woman a knockout."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"Throughout Wonder Woman there is an earnestness in tone that plays well, and rarely as saccharine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"This film is a goddamned blast. To merely call it the strongest entrant in the DC Entertainment Universe so far is to call Jaws the strongest entrant in the shark movie canon. Say what you will about Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Deep Blue Sea, but Wonder Woman is in another class altogether."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it’s necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Gadot is simply marvelous. Physically, she’s bold and commanding. But there’s a sweetness about her too, as if she and Jenkins understand intuitively that Wonder Woman can’t just be blandly awesome. She's got to be able to feel wonder too."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Its earnest insouciance recalls the “Superman” movies of the ’70s and ’80s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,This really is Wonder Woman coming to the rescue of the DC Comics universe.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Gadot is a godsend, Pine charms, and Jenkins delivers old-school thrills with heart and conviction."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"If the action in Wonder Woman comes less frequently than you might expect, it’s also thrillingly designed and staged, with a surging sense of real people, from all sorts of backgrounds, swept up in the wider conflict’s churns and jolts."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"As Diana, Gadot is excellent, a rocking electric cello riff in human form."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Wonder Woman is a gorgeous, powerful display of epic storytelling that makes me wish this was Gadot’s first chance to play Diana Prince. It’s the roaring introduction she deserves, and a hopeful shift in DC culture that hints at what’s about to come."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Wonder Woman is the first major studio superhero film directed by a woman, and it shows in a number of subtle, yet important ways."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,79,"Wonder Woman is leaps and bounds above the other three entries in the DCEU. With a dramatic setting, a few entertaining action scenes, and a strong supporting cast all working together to tell an inspirational Hero’s Journey, it more than offsets some occasionally uneven acting on Gadot’s part and some shaky technical aspects."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,78,"This, uh, wonderfully directed and near-perfectly cast iconic heroine female empowerment story is so similar in tone and feel to Marvel Studios’ ""Captain America"" that I was waiting for Stan Lee to show up, possibly as a eunuch."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Wonder Woman may not qualify as a particularly suspenseful First World War movie and it may not feature enough globe-spinning special effects to satisfy hard-core superhero fans, but it certainly is an intriguing combination of the two genres."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Pine makes a perfect foil for Gadot’s furrowed-brow sincerity, his Steve Trevor wry and comfortable enough in his skin to hold his own with Diana (even when she’s scrutinizing his naked form)."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Jenkins and her collaborators have done what I thought was previously impossible: created a Wonder Woman film that is inspiring, blistering, and compassionate, in ways that honor what has made this character an icon."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Wonder Woman may not cure all the ills of pop culture’s superhero-saturation syndrome; in fact, in many ways it succumbs to some of its worst excesses. But at least it brings an exhilarating, vicarious kick to the sagging, bagging table."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"The first two hours run the gamut from interesting to delightful. The final 20 minutes are roaring, ridiculous business as usual. We should be thankful the tide of mediocrity is held back as long as it is."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,Wonder Woman achieves touching and powerful moments that are unusual for a movie of this kind.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,72,"Wonder Woman won’t reinvent the superhero franchise, or the origin story. But it does show how compelling they can still be, when someone is allowed to do them right."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,The violence and fights in Wonder Woman are intriguing not just because they’re stunning but also because of how emotional they are.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Gadot is terrific, capturing perfectly the grace, power and heroism of the Amazonian princess who must make herself present in the world to save it."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Though the action...sometimes has a slightly distracting video game feel, it’s often stirring stuff, and it’s skillfully integrated into the developing relationship between the title character and her mortal man."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Wonder Woman is exciting, romantic, funny — and my favorite DC Extended Universe movie to date. With her courage and strength, Diana sets an example for everyone she meets, and she holds fast to her ideals even under great pressure. With any luck, she’ll provide similar inspiration to the directors of the DC Extended Universe in the years ahead."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"As with all comics-based extravaganzas, brevity is anathema to the Patty Jenkins-directed Wonder Woman, and it doesn’t quite transcend the traits of franchise product as it checks off the list of action-fantasy requisites."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,67,The best parts of Wonder Woman are frivolous in the best way.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,67,"The best thing about Wonder Woman, the overlong and intermittently enjoyable new DC superhero spectacular, is Wonder Woman herself."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"Gadot proves she is worthy of Wonder Woman’s tiara, but the superhero deserves a great film, not one that’s just better than the others."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"Wonder Woman is a strong, at times even rousing, application of the superhero film formula, but it ultimately can’t transcend the constraints of the genre."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"The movie is a derivative hash of comic book picture plot points and origin story touchstones — half “Captain America: The First Avenger,” half “Thor.” But director Patty Jenkins, who did not get enough credit for “Monster,” keeps Gadot in frame and the tone light."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,The star is unstoppable and spectacular to see in motion. Watch her fly.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,60,"Wonder Woman is not a great film, nor is it the feminist glass ceiling-smasher that many had hoped for. But after the offensively stupid Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman feels nothing short of revelatory."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,60,"The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,58,"Yes, it’s the DCEU’s best film, but as we know, that’s not saying a lot. But, hey, that terrific second act that we should cling to even if it’s a distant memory by the time love defeats aggression. “Wonder Woman” might be molded by the mighty Gods, but as shaped by mere mortals her mettle and beliefs and can be only so wonderfully divine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,50,"When the separatist compound must accommodate an interloper — Steve Trevor, fished out of the sea by Diana after his plane goes down — any hopes that Wonder Woman will sustain its appealing misandry are soon dashed."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,40,"It’s plagued by the same problems that dragged down previous visits to the DC movie world: over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot. What promised to be a glass-ceiling-smashing blockbuster actually looks more like a future camp classic."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,100,"The film's immense cast and crew, headed by director Michael Bay, writer Randall Wallace and stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, blend artistry and technology to create a blockbuster entertainment that has passion, valor and tremendous action."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,It expertly capitalizes on the emotional associations Americans have with Pearl Harbor and renders the battle scenes with an excellence that goes beyond proficiency and into the realm of art.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,"The cast is engaging, the overall visual effects are tremendous and I found myself fairly swept away for most of the fast-moving, three-hour running time."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,"Until a disappointing tailspin in the last hour, Pearl Harbor is the best piece of popular entertainment to come along in years."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,"Ninety minutes into this massive movie the attack commences, and the spectacular images come hurtling like fireballs. This is, let's be honest, what we're here for, and what most Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movies serve up best: the poetry of destruction."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,Parts of this three-hour World War II epic are brilliant -- especially the 40-minute sequence in which the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is stunningly re-created.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,"The picture is nearly painstaking in its traditionalism, a tale of love, war, and valor in which nostalgia for ''simpler times'' gets mashed together, almost fetishistically, with nostalgia for old movies and for the spirit of knightly self sacrifice during World War II."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,67,A movie meant to explode off the screen -- and it's at its best when those explosions are going full blast.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,63,"It's war porn, a movie that revels in the carnage."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,60,"Works best as a bang-and- boom action picture, a loud symphony of bombardment and explosion juiced up with frantic editing and shiny computer-generated imagery."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,60,"It's a Ritalin-deprived sensibility, but it keeps you skating over the dull spots, in which the film unfortunately is rich."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"A crowd-pleasing blockbuster if ever there was one, features as its centerpiece a jaw-droppingly vivid re-creation of the Japanese attack on the U.S.'s fabled (and extremely vulnerable, as it turned out) Pacific fleet."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"""Pearl Harbor"" is exactly the kind of prestige project you'd expect from a director like Bay, hitting all its targets with plodding precision and never once achieving surprise."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"Clearly, neither screenwriter Randall Wallace nor director Michael Bay ever met a cliche he didn't embrace."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"For all its agonizing true-life trappings, has the staying power of a grand-scale video game. Manhattan's sushi bars are in no danger of going dark."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,The filmmakers would have been better advised to stick with the Zeroes and spend less time making up heroes.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"The 2,400 Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor deserve a nobler memorial than this sentimental hogwash that reduces heroism to ""Top Gun"" antics and pretty cinematography."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"Unfortunately, the bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,It's an extravaganza worth seeing once -- and maybe later on DVD.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"If you decide to hit the concessions stand (where you're bound to have lots of company), I'd suggest going out for popcorn during either the first hour or the third, because the second features some pretty good big-screen effects involving planes, ships, and explosions."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"The chaos is convincing, but, less ruthless than Steven Spielberg, Bay eschews D-day panic and mutilation."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"A Michael Bay movie: bang bang, paper-thin characters, wooden screenplay."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"I found ""Pearl Harbor"" annoying but not excruciating—even at three hours, it's less assaultive than either ""The Mummy Returns"" or ""Moulin Rouge."""
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"The film has no soul. An epic about this day of infamy should shake you to the core. But the real infamy about Pearl Harbor is that when you exit, you don't feel a thing."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Perhaps they should have called this ""Bore-a, Bore-a, Bore-a."""
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Just compare their superficiality to the complex characters in ""From Here to Eternity"" and what's missing here becomes terribly clear."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,Fiction and fantasy to evade reflection on the world we actually live in.
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"A silly, if fun, futuristic sci-fi romance."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"The Host will make perfect sense to 12-year-old girls, while their college-age sisters will probably laugh themselves sick and their mothers will look at Hurt and wonder when he got so old."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"The Host is top-heavy with profound, sonorous conversations, all tending to sound like farewells. The movie is so consistently pitched at the same note, indeed, that the structure robs it of possibilities for dramatic tension."
The Host,5.9,26627201,60,"The Host gets bogged down in its “who’s kissing whom now?” dynamics, and it becomes all too easy to snicker at it."
The Host,5.9,26627201,60,"An ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" retread told from a postoccupation vantage point, this adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s YA romance novel unfolds in a dystopian future when alien parasites have nearly won the battle for Earth."
The Host,5.9,26627201,58,"The Host is a step up from the endless metaphorical lectures and gaping plot holes of Niccol’s last film, In Time, but its muffled emotions, delivered with Twilight-esque blank-eyed calm, put it in the same category of a creative idea hamstrung in execution."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"As with the Twilight series, The Host's infelicities—drab dialogue, ridiculous plotting, more emotional crises than there is story—are enlivened by its thematic eccentricities."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,Saoirse Ronan's talents are wasted on a foolish dual part in this dull sci-fi fantasy.
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"There's something about novelist Stephenie Meyer that induces formerly interesting directors to suddenly make films that are slow, silly and soporific."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,Extravagantly silly but undeniably entertaining sci-fi soap opera.
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"'Twilight' of the Body Snatchers, without much urgency or sexual heat."
The Host,5.9,26627201,42,"The Host doesn't strive for social allegory, as previous body snatcher flicks have done with the Red Scare, civil rights and Watergate. If anything it's merely a teenage girl's fantasy checklist for prom."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"This film adaptation feels like YA, with cat’s-cradle love matches, soft-focus sexuality, and a main character who never satisfactorily makes the transition from page to screen."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"Niccol and Meyer -- who co-produces this, her first post-""Twilight"" film -- choose to trade away any shred of the ripe social subtext that has made other body-snatcher films so rich. In its place: the kind of supernatural, star-crossed romance that generates so much swooning from Team ""Twilight."""
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"Watch closely and you might even spy a better film inside, straining to break free."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"The movie, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer of “Twilight” fame and directed by Andrew Niccol, is just kind of dumb. Like the more famous books and movies, about a love triangle between a vampire, a werewolf and a human girl, it often plays like a teenage girl’s idea of how literary romances play out."
The Host,5.9,26627201,38,"To work, The Host would have required a visionary interpretation rather than the mundane telling that Niccol opts for."
The Host,5.9,26627201,38,"The Host basically comes down to a vote for Team Jared or Team Ian. I voted myself into oblivion about half an hour in. Niccol, who once added mystery and suspense to the sci-fi of 1997's ""Gattaca,"" is no match for the giant marshmallow that is The Host."
The Host,5.9,26627201,37,It’s a mushy and unsuspenseful melodrama.
The Host,5.9,26627201,30,"The story goes slack onscreen, so much so that the movie's two-plus hours will seem an eternity."
The Host,5.9,26627201,30,"Dopey, derivative and dull, The Host is a brazen combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes, young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation. That sounds like it should work (really!), but it never does, largely because the story is as drained of energy as are its moony aliens."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"Ronan, youthfully elegant as always, tries hard, but the material defeats her."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"Its title, very graciously, doesn't end with a ""Part 1,"" but The Host sure has enough plot points and ideas to fill two installments."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"A long, tedious and often unintentionally hilarious adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s sci-fi follow-up."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,An invasion of the body snatchers is preferable to realizing that the true horror perpetrated here is not on the characters but on the audience.
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"The film may as well be titled ""Stephenie Meyer's Waiting Around."""
The Host,5.9,26627201,20,"Steven Spielberg famously retained his childhood sense of wonder. On this evidence, Meyer has maintained a nine-year-old's notion of titillating romance."
The Host,5.9,26627201,0,It's really a dramatic sinkhole.
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,91,"Fred Dekker’s 1987 horror comedy is, like totally, the ultimate ’80s movie. An agreeably goofy, Little Rascals-meets-The Goonies time passer, the movie is proudly anti-CGI."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"Sharper than a stake in it's genre references, The Monster Squad appeals to cinephile as well as teen sensibilities."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"The film paints a nostalgic portrait of the fears we all shared as children - the common knowledge that when our parents left the room, the monsters under our beds - or locked inside our closest - started to shift and scratch; that our only friend in the midnight hour was the nightlight in the corner of the room."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"The Monster Squad is such fun, it makes you wish you were a kid again."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,80,"It’s every kids dream to fight monsters, and in some ways The Monster Squad helps us live out that fantasy. And it’s a damn good film chalk full of horror movie references, and nods to classic films that only the discernible eye can catch."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,75,"Squad joins The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Gremlins, and Poltergeist in a winning '80s subgenre dedicated to ghoulies invading the suburbs."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,75,"More of a clever comic parody than a jokey pastiche, this lively kiddies' horror pic delivers frights and laughs which are rooted in a sure and sympathetic grasp of Monster Movie mythology."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,70,"A silly attempt to crossbreed an Our Gang comedy with a classic horror film, which usually means that both genres have reached the end of the line."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,50,"Most of what's included in this unapologetically scrambled mixture of Goonies, Hardy Boys adventures, Ghostbusters and Abbott and Costello monster films is bad actors wandering around in bad makeup and rubber masks and two kinds of kids -- cute, intolerably noisy, smart-alecky kids and not-so-cute, noisy, smart-alecky kids. I don't know which kind I liked least."
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,50,This second feature from director Fred Dekker is a poorly paced and haphazardly scripted horror-comedy that is neither scary nor particularly funny.
The Monster Squad,7.1,3769990,50,"Crass but imponderable, bizarrely mixing glowingly back-lit sentimentality with stomach-churning violence and juvenile sex jokes."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,83,"The triumph of a film like Upgrade, an unapologetic B-movie, is that it aims low and exceeds expectations."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,82,"Upgrade is an intense sci-fi action thriller with big ideas, incredible action and a remarkable lead performance."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"It’s still a small, silly movie and there’s nothing particularly novel or even of the moment about its technosceptic stance on machines, but as a genre exercise, it’s a fun ride."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"At its best – in a boundless chase round a hackers’ hangout, and a high-speed freeway pursuit – Upgrade is as fluid and exhilarating as anything the Wachowskis signed their names to in the days when they were brothers: the kind of nifty, sometimes nasty surprise our multiplexes sorely need."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"A retro science-fiction actioner with both brains and brawn – quite a lot of brawn, actually. Surely destined for cult status."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"A great and grimy little screw-turner of sci-fi schlock, the kind that they truly don’t make anymore, the kind that would make Carpenter and Cameron proud."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,What Whannell wants most to do is torment and eventually pulverize most of the people in his narrative orbit and make you laugh while he does so.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Leigh Whannell’s new film is exactly the kind of pure trash that feels suited to spaces that are dirty, neglected, a little bit worse for wear. But this is no insult."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Without taking itself too seriously or academically, Upgrade operates with a level of remarkable rigor. This is a film that kicks ass, takes names, and has a healthy skepticism of the future without straying too far away from its B-movie, body horror ambitions."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"An irresistibly gory science-fiction melodrama, is B-movie schlock done right."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade is a movie by Leigh Whannell, who wrote “Saw,” “Insidious” and other memorable horror movies. But other than the occasional moment of stunningly gratuitous gore, it’s nothing like those films."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade is a brutish, efficient and well-executed slice of cyberpunk action horror with a silly streak."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade, Whannell’s second outing behind the camera, is yet another top-notch repair job, this time a kinetic sci-fi riff fashioned from scrap metal and human entrails, nervily updating Cronenbergian body horror for the iOS era."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,Upgrade’s sheer energy and the strength of its concept do more than enough to elevate this revenge picture into something refreshing and eminently watchable.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Whannell strikes out on his own with his first truly original concept as a writer-director...in a film whose production is as ambitious as its story is formulaic. Thankfully, the former mostly compensates for the latter, making Upgrade a genre-bending summer treat for those who don’t mind a little (okay, a lot) of blood with their popcorn."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Whannell commits to making a science fiction film plugged into the moment in which we’re living, and making grim projections of what might be around the corner."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"If Upgrade ultimately plays like a genre exercise, it’s certainly a taut, engrossing one."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Upgrade is an energetic, superficially slick, latter-day B-movie of the “but dumb” category. That is, it’s kind of like “RoboCop,” but dumb, and also like “Ex Machina,” but dumb."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Infusing its familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes with stylishly gonzo, low-budget filmmaking and inventive narrative flourishes, Upgrade proves far more entertaining than it has a right to be."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Upgrade offers memorable, legible fights, a compelling bombed-out retro-apocalyptic look and a mystery that seems obvious at the start but then keeps twisting."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,67,Upgrade is a welcome excuse to put Marshall-Green through some delightfully complex fight choreography.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Upgrade manages to entice and provoke, impress and terrify, if you let it."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Like all B-movies, this one provides moments of visceral satisfaction while ignoring nuance and (at times) logic."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"It’s a funny concept, helped by Marshall-Green’s blended look of pleasure and consternation at being the vessel for an invincibility that he enjoys but cannot control."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,Whannell is learning how forward motion can allow a filmmaker to get away with some pretty outlandish brutality. I wish the talk-dependent sequences weren’t so foreshadowed and clunky; only Gabriel transcends them.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Upgrade is most effective when mining the comical and bizarre love-hate chemistry between Grey and Stem and pairing that singular conflict with batshit-crazy action, but the film’s follow-through is clunky and unfulfilling."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"If it sometimes lapses into genre clichés, Upgrade still delivers on the action front. Just turn your phone off before you go into the cinema, lest it gets ideas."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"The action sequences are electric; they’re grimy, choppy, and strange. But when the characters talk, the film stretches and slows to a banal cautionary tale, almost as if Whannell was making the movie as a homework assignment, having a ton of fun with the aesthetics and the fight scenes, then suddenly remembering he was supposed to incorporate some “themes.”"
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"Whannell’s finite reserves of creativity have been meted out in an imbalance, going all in on world-building while giving the fight choreography and the cinematography listlessly documenting it the short shrift."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,58,"At the end of the day, it’s the action equivalent of a secondhand musical – you’ll most likely come for the dance scenes, and they’re good enough to wade through the filler."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,50,"The film isn’t a dud — it “delivers the goods” in a certain reductive, baseline action-fanboy way. Yet Upgrade is the sort of movie that thinks it’s more ingenious than it is, starting with the premise, which is a semi-catchy, semi-stupido hoot in a way that the movie couldn’t have completely intended."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,50,"If this vaguely cyberpunk, occasionally comic Australian flick were named after its own qualities, it would have been called “Knockoff.”"
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,42,"As a movie, it’s the cinematic equivalent of paint-by-numbers: competent, attractive even, but take a single step closer and the lines peek through. There’s no need to pay money to go see Upgrade: If you select it on a plane and sleep through 60% of it, you’ve seen it in its entirety."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,80,"Made with energetic flair and no small dose of violence, mercifully handled with discretion, Hostage exemplifies taut, confident filmmaking."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,75,"My new theory is that Willis' own aesthetic soul is more old-world than he knows, and that he works best with directors who either are (Luc Besson) or might as well be (M. Night Shyamalan) European."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,75,Hostage has suspense and momentum.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,75,"The mechanics of the final showdown are unexpected and yet show an undeniable logic, and are sold by the acting skills of Willis and Pollak."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,70,"If Hostage looks a lot like a state-of-the-art French ""policier"" minus the pesky subtitles, the effect is purely intentional."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,70,"The movie isn't particularly tasteful or finely crafted -- but it grabs you by the jugular, and only during an overcooked climax does it finally relax its grip."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,67,"Full of small, weird moments."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"Willis, who'll turn 50 a week from Saturday, has this kind of hero down pat. He may never again get or demand the complicated dramatic roles I think he could handle, but he's well-cast."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"Hostage is really about sleek Bruce - buff, bald and clean-shaven - as he goes to town on two sets of assailants."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"On the plus side, bloated narratives make for a busy action star, and Bruce is quite the workaholic on this outing, clearly eager to rekindle memories of his ""Die Hard"" glory days."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,63,"Right from the intriguing opening sequence, which hints at the bleakness which envelops the movie, Willis’ Talley is an interesting character."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,What sends this initially tense thriller over the precipice is a plot scheme that never knows when enough is enough.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,Brainlessly efficient action thriller.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,"Certainly delivers violence and heroics, but not in a way everyone is going to enjoy -- it's brutal and harrowing."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,60,"There's a gripping thriller between the gaps in logic. Director Florent Siri has a tough style and an unforgiving attitude, but it drowns in the queasy blood lust."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,58,"The action is dynamically filmed and Willis is at his best. Suspense is soon hijacked by outright gore and grisliness, though."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"From the first strains of its overly dramatic, self-important score -- come on, this is not by any stretch of the imagination ""Citizen Kane."""
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,Especially discomfiting is the stream of kids in peril.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"It's a B-flick all the way, but it has no pretensions to the contrary, and that's some kind of refreshing."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"By the time the film escalates into a suitably ridiculous Grand Guignol finale, all connection to reality has been severed."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,50,"Bruce looks hot and underplays handsomely as always, but Hostage is a steaming pile of siege clichés and screaming unlikelihoods."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,40,"The amazing thing is how dull a movie crawling with gunfire, psycho tantrums and stuff blowing up can be when you just don't care what happens to anyone."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,40,"Director Siri has a stylish eye that makes this film resemble a film noir outing, but the script (by Doug Richardson) is at first routine before growing increasingly outlandish."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,40,"Beyond the cliches, there's something deeply offensive about the way Hostage exploits our empathy for children in peril."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,38,An unrelenting assault on the brain and eardrums.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,38,It doesn't satisfy in the way a good thriller ought to.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,30,"But by the time Willis's character saves this considerably long day, it's filmgoers who will no doubt feel like prisoners, as a movie that promises to be a taut nail-biter devolves into the kind of silly, overblown climax parodied so beautifully by Robert Altman in ""The Player."""
Hostage,6.6,34639939,30,"Take a tired formula...Stir with a director, Florent Siri, who has no shame about stealing every sadistic suspense trick from the Die Hard series. Serve to a gullible audience willing to pay top dollar for secondhand goods."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,30,Hostage may well be the first action flick cited both for child abuse and audience abuse. In a singularly sadistic and degrading way it has something to offend everyone.
Hostage,6.6,34639939,25,"This is a half-hearted, derivative action film with not a single honest artistic impulse behind it."
Hostage,6.6,34639939,25,"More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on Hostage, a pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,88,One of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,83,"Starts out as mind-bending futuristic satire and then turns relentless -- it becomes a violent, postpunk version of an Indiana Jones cliff-hanger."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"A worthy entry in the dystopian cycle of SF movies launched by ""Blade Runner"" (including ""The Terminator"" and ""Robocop""), this seems less derivative than most of its predecessors yet equally accomplished in its straight-ahead storytelling, with plenty of provocative satiric undertones and scenic details."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"The fierce and unrelenting pace, accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay, keeps the film moving like a juggernaut."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,Top-flight muscleman entertainment that is not afraid to have a brain or two in its head.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"An ""intelligent"" action film, because it presents the viewer with an opportunity to puzzle things out rather than sit mindlessly and watch people get blown to pieces."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,Mr. Verhoeven is much better at drumming up this sort of artificial excitement than he is at knowing when to stop.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,75,"Actually, any fun you might encounter in Recall can be traced, most often, to director Verhoeven, who injects some of his ""Robocop"" camp into this mega-dumb project."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,75,"Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent--let's not mince words--this film should be called ""Total Reject."""
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,63,Guilty of gross mellerdrammer & innocent of sophistication... Guilty of being dumber than WWF wrestling & innocent of hypocrisy about its cartoon violence.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,63,"The overall effect is like wading through hospital waste. Verhoeven, who also directed the maliciously stylistic ""Robocop,"" disappoints with this appalling onslaught of blood and boredom."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,83,"Yet nothing in their visually stimulating film registers as strongly as Jolie’s enigmatic, ever-changing face."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,80,"Angelina Jolie is so wickedly enchanting in the magical, magnificent Maleficent, you may not notice how transporting this female-driven blockbuster really is."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,80,"A few bumpy patches notwithstanding, the new feature is an exquisitely designed, emotionally absorbing work of dark enchantment."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"A moderately enchanting, sometimes thought-provoking corrective to the flaws in the story that inspired it."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,Jolie's Maleficent is magnificent.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"In truth, you just can’t wait until the wicked Jolie returns to the screen. Whether a malevolent twinkle illuminates her beady eye or a heartbreaking tear rolls down her alabaster cheek, she is the film’s power."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"Calling Maleficent a ""modern-day classic,"" as some have asserted, is overreaching. The production is engaging and appealing but only the passage of time will determine whether it holds in the memory with the strength of its animated predecessor."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"The movie is a mess, but it's a rich mess. It has weight. It matters."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,Maleficent imparts a feeling of enchantment. Here is a world that's strange and beautiful.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,The result is a rare live-action Disney movie that merits comparison to its beloved feature-length cartoons.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,70,"Whatever its flaws, Maleficent is a family-friendly Disney adventure that offers a relaunched and thoroughly delightful Angelina Jolie."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,70,This is really a movie about the evil spell Jolie casts on us — it’s both a celebration and a demonstration of her formidable movie star might.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,70,"Though it never plays like a polemic, the film has so much it wants to say the emotional power that might have made it a classic is undercut."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,67,"Imaginatively, it places all the known elements of the story in different contexts, completely recasting this familiar fairy tale into a more poignant and resonant work."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,67,"Maleficent feels spit-balled into more directions than barely 90 minutes of story time can adequately cover. It's once upon a time, happily ever after and a lot of undeveloped drama in between."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,67,"The characters are boiled down to their essentials, the humor is timelessly broad, and Jolie's at her best when she's curling her claws and elongating her vowels like a black-sabbath Tallulah Bankhead."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,63,"For all its limitations, Maleficent manages to be improbably entertaining to watch, due solely to its title character. As befits a star of her regal standing and superb self-awareness, Angelina Jolie has managed to bend even the Brothers Grimm to her indomitable will."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,63,"While this is Jolie’s show, obviously — and she’s terrifically arch — the surprising dearth of other compelling characters doesn’t offer much distraction when things get off track."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,63,"This is almost entirely Angelina Jolie's show...this is a performance that goes from point A to point B without seeming rote, or ho-hum."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"Enchanting enough to cast a spell over fans, of Jolie, of Disney, of ""Sleeping Beauty"" -- and of pure, cinematic escapism."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"Consciously or not, coherently or not, Maleficent tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"If you go into Maleficent expecting Jolie to be the badass of Sleeping Beauty, you’re going to get burned."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"Despite its pitfalls, Maleficent entertains because of Jolie, who holds the wavering threads of Stromberg's spinning wheel together with aplomb."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"The aggressively unpleasant visuals certainly detract from the overall film, but Maleficent makes for a fascinating entry in an ongoing wave of projects that give “bad” women of literature a chance to present their side of the story."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"The action sequences are executed with rhythm and punch, and our heroine swoops and swirls around like Iron Man in a sheath dress. Maleficent may be short on true enchantment, but until we find a superhero who can pull off a black silk cocktail gown in battle, she’s very welcome."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,It’s a dazzling showcase of fantasy-based filmmaking in the 21st century that also manages a feeble attempt at injecting feminist politics into an antiquated narrative. Yet its eventual climax strains from the obviousness of these efforts.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,"Director Robert Stromberg, making his debut as a director after supervising the visual effects for movies like “Alice in Wonderland” and “Avatar,” lacks the transcendent touch."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,"While I can see how there is a version of this film that might be able to successfully grapple with its central metaphor, I'm not sure Stromberg is the guy to make that movie."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,More well-intentioned than accomplished.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,Jolie’s commitment to the part is admirable: She gives this Maleficent a real emotional urgency. But the rest of the movie lets her down.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"It fails to live up to its early promise, mostly because of an uneven tone and murky character development"
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,Maleficent is out of balance in all sorts of ways. The effective silent sequences conflict with the frustratingly talky ones. The new material fits poorly with moments that directly quote the classic.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"Jolie's performance so overshadows the rest of the cast (and the rest of the movie) that you sometimes feel as if the other characters are, like us, just standing around watching her. This is not, however, the fault of the other actors. It's the fault of screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who doesn't give them much to do that's challenging or interesting."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,Impressive. And violent. Just not a lot of fun.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"Why tell the Sleeping Beauty story anew? With this half-hearted film, Mr. Stromberg, the visual effects wizard behind such big-budget blockbusters as ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Avatar,"" can’t provide an answer."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"Uncertain of tone, and bearing visible scarring from what one imagines were multiple rewrites, the film fails to probe the psychology of its subject or set up a satisfying alternate history, but it sure is nice to look at for 97 minutes."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,42,"Maleficent desperately tries to create a character whose motivation you will understand and empathize with. But the screenplay and direction are such a tangled, thorny patch of conflicting ideas that it's hard to tell what that motivation is supposed to be."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,40,"If this tiresome yarn is the ‘true’ story of one of Disney’s most popular villains then, please, give us colourful lies and happy ignorance."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,40,This icon of witchcraft can't save a production that's suffocatingly elaborate yet insufficiently bewitching.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,40,"With more actual grrrl power, Maleficent would be a bold redo. Instead, it's a beautiful snooze, a story that hints at the darkness underneath our fairy tales and tarnishes the idea of true love without quite daring to say what's really on its mind: that even the best of us might not live happily ever after."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,38,"Maleficent is an admittedly great-looking, sometimes creepy, often plodding and utterly unconvincing re-imagining of a famous romantic fairy tale as a female empowerment metaphor."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,38,"Jolie comes to this party ready to bite, but the movie muzzles her. Even at 97 minutes, Maleficent is still one long, laborious slog."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,38,"We may have all wanted to know the story behind those famed horns, but the mystery was far preferable to having Maleficent de-fanged and de-clawed in the process."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,30,"Except for Angelina Jolie, exemplary as the fairy badmother who laid a narcotic curse on an infant princess, this pricey live-action drama is a dismaying botch."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,83,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit though, gets the international-espionage ingredients almost exactly right."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,80,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is half silliness, half swagger, but Branagh's arms-akimbo impudence as a director makes it work. He takes it all seriously, but with a wink."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"The movie finds its feet, and unrolls as a pretty suspenseful, largely engaging, and hardly ever too-over-the-top spy thriller."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit provides the best motion picture adventure for the title character since his introduction in ""The Hunt for Red October."""
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"Even with its thrifty set pieces and smaller ambitions, this attempt to reboot the series based on Tom Clancy characters does the most important thing right: It almost always feels like a Jack Ryan movie."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"In keeping his actors on his sober-yet-buoyant plane, Kenneth Branagh presents a convincing romance that doesn't stall the film's brisk clip."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,75,"Soundly structured, smart and fast, with a plausible central scenario, several gripping moments and well-wrought dialogue."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,A reboot of an A-level spy series seems too pretty-good to be true. Shadow Recruit occupies this weekend’s movie screens as familiarly and reassuringly as a Walther PPK fits in the hand of James Bond.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,"A competently made, moderately diverting variation on a genre standard."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,"Crisp, efficient and appreciably modest in scale...this conspicuous attempt to breathe new life into a long-dormant action franchise gets at least a few things right, chiefly the shrewd casting of Chris Pine."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,70,"Branagh did a nice job of directing ""Thor,"" but all he can do here is try to energize the recycled pulp of the script."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,67,"Too much of the action in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit takes place on laptops, thumb drives, and video monitors."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Slick, loud, assured, overplotted (way overplotted), fairly diverting, and pretty much empty."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Though directed with great precision by Branagh, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is saddled with a boilerplate script."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit has no personality of its own. It's a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision. It's hard to care when Jack turns operational and becomes a CIA robocop. The movie feels untouched by human hands.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Pine, who has been so good and so instrumental in J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek series as Captain Kirk, turns out to be a decent Ryan."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"Branagh & Co. keep up appearances with a thriller that works mainly because all of its parts — locations, fights and plot twists — are well worn from all the thrillers they’ve been in before."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,The film is slow in getting started and once it's underway it's only intermittently involving. It's also occasionally far-fetched.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,63,"A solid outing for a re-Bourne hero that could, with a few key tweaks, generate another round of vehicles for the Clancy cash cow."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"In stripping Jack Ryan back to basics it’s lost some sophistication, but reinvigorated an action hero who’s unlike any other on offer and who absolutely earns his second — or rather fourth — shot."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"The movie itself isn’t dull. It’s moderately stylish, moderately suspenseful, fun in patches. It hits its marks. But the setup lacks urgency."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a well-made movie, well-acted (Costner and Branagh seem to be having an especially good time) and a pleasant diversion. They’ll probably make several more. But it doesn’t exactly put the “thrill” in action thriller."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"Branagh, taking advantage of his experience helming 2011’s “Thor,” shows an allegiance to the genre he’s working in; both as director as co-star, he pours on the menace."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"The plot’s a bit complex for what amounts to a lot of running around — the movie can’t help but evoke the Bourne series along with a high-gloss hint of Skyfall, not wholly unpleasantly."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,60,"By my rough calculation, the real Jack Ryan should be approximately 103. Preposterous but moderately engaging, Jack Ryan has outlived his welcome, and there’s no end in sight."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"There is no shaking the feeling that Branagh and his cast are a kind of an espionage film B team, capable of mild diversion but nothing more."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"Branagh, who proved his action bona fides with “Thor,” does an inarguably competent job of choreographing a modestly intelligent espionage thriller, even if it’s impossible to identify anything new he’s bringing to an already groaning table."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,The movie eventually evokes the sense that Branagh is better at directing in front of the camera than from behind it; its best moments are typically the ones that feature Branagh’s Viktor Cherevin on-screen.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"There’s promising raw material here, particularly in the early scenes. But the film’s second half seems determined to snuff out the promise of its first, making it hard to wish for this incarnation of the character, or any, to have more big-screen adventures."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,An average franchise re-launch.
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"Efficient, if ultimately rote, political thriller."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,50,"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit refashions the character (this time played by Chris Pine) into a man of immediate action, and in doing so drains him of anything that made him a relatable human being."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,42,"This is moviemaking in a modular mode, an inspiration-free action adventure — with cheesy cinematography — that fills its modest running time by fitting together familiar elements into something reliably, even insistently, not new."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,40,"The appeal of the Jack Ryan character, at least on the page, was that he was always the smartest guy in the room. In Shadow Recruit, that doesn’t seem to be much of an accomplishment, because the movie around him is so dumb."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,50577412,38,"Branagh might as well have opened a can and dumped it on a plate, the ridges of a factory-line production still perfectly hatched on a gelatinous cylinder of crud."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,67,"It's not exactly thrilling, and it doesn't cover much new ground. But young audiences will lap it up like ice cream."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,60,An enjoyable escapade and a great introduction to the forthcoming series - just not the seventh Star Wars film fans were hoping for.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,58,"With its simple-goal-driven plot, its wordy, cutscene-like interludes, and its stiffly modeled characters, it wouldn't even make for a particularly high-end videogame."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"The largely uninspired Clone Wars feels landlocked. In the absence of any extensive innovation, the video game-ready results play more like a feature-length promo for the imminent TV series of the same name than a stand-alone event."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,This isn't the Star Wars we've always known and at least sometimes loved.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"When George Lucas last pulled off an original idea for a feature film, Bill Clinton was still thought of by many voters as overweight and chaste."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,The Clone Wars is the last nail in a coffin that has been propped up ever since George Lucas sold his creative soul in the quest for a few more pieces of gold.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"Looks fantastic, but the film suffers from the TV-to-feature transition."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,Gets more cluttered and confused as it moves along.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"Lucas' films are like Cher's face. No matter how many times you rework the same material, it's never going to be new and fresh again. And so it is with his latest, Star Wars: The Clone Wars."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,Essentially an extended trailer for the 2008 Cartoon Network animated series.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"As a mechanical thrill ride, The Clone Wars has an uncluttered look and furious pace that make it more or less as satisfying as its wildly overdesigned predecessors."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,50,"Once again, even reasonably committed fans will need a scorecard to keep track of who's fighting whom. What's the real target audience - i.e. kids - supposed to make of it all?"
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,42,"It might be impressive as a made-for-DVD production, but coming from producer George Lucas, it makes for a cheap excuse for a big-screen spectacle."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,42,"Unlike its predecessors, this one doesn't even try to aspire to myth. It aspires only to merchandising."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,40,"The Clone Wars is minor to the point of irrelevance, nothing more than a stylized direct-to-DVD shrug projected onto a big screen while Lucas launches two more TV series filling in prequel blanks better left empty."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,40,"Despite some absolutely gorgeous animation and adjusting expectations for what Clone Wars is meant to be, the Force is not strong with this one."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,38,Don't expect the seventh Star Wars film here. Star Wars: The Clone Wars is more like a long Saturday morning cartoon.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,38,Basically just a 98-minute trailer for the autumn launch of a new series on the Cartoon Network.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,38,"While the movie and the accompanying series are being pitched to a younger audience than most new Star Wars ventures, parents may be perturbed by the film's relentless violence."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,33,"The animated characters in ""Clone Wars"" are about as lively as the actors in the live-action movies, so I guess Lucas has achieved his goal of eliminating humans from his movies altogether."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,30,Unfolds with all the entertainment value of watching somebody else play a video game.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,30,"Clone Wars will appeal only to the most tolerant, galactically minded children and their parents."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,30,"The whole thing feels like a continuation of Lucas' experiments to see how much sh-- his dwindling supporters will take before finally saying ""enough"" and moving on to adult pursuits."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,25,At what point might animators be arrested for doing work so ugly it causes aesthetic blindness in millions of younglings?
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,20,The latest indignity.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,20,Story is entirely insignificant in The Clone Wars.
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,20,"Without the grandiose narrative structure of the six live-action releases, this feels even more pointless, a mechanical attempt to milk the kids for every last dime."
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,5.9,35161554,0,George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,88,This is an action movie. It makes no apology for that. But it's high-style action.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,80,Writer B.J. Nelson has skillfully combined plot elements and situations which draw from the best of Westerns and anti-Establishment cop films.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,75,"The plot, set in and around El Paso, is unimportant and nonstop, like an old-fashioned, Saturday afternoon serial, which isn't at all bad. Steve Carver, the director, understands that in such films action is content."
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,70,Fans of Soldier of Fortune magazine will think they've been ambushed and blown away to heaven by Lone Wolf McQuade. Every conceivable type of portable weapon on the world market is tried out by the macho warriors on both sides of the law in this modern western.
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,70,"This is one of the better Norris action films, showcasing his astounding martial-arts skills. But the film loses power toward the end when the action bends reality a little too much."
Lone Wolf McQuade,6.4,12232628,50,"As senseless violence goes, this is very senseless and very violent. Norris is a Texas Ranger, Carradine an oily Senator smuggling weapons to 'Central American terrorists', but the storyline has more non sequiturs than bodies, which is saying something."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,75,"In his feature film debut, Little uses washed-out color and a you-are-there immediacy to tell a powerful wartime tale of survival, morality and honor."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,75,"Saints and Soldiers isn't a great film, but what it does, it does well."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,75,"It's no earthshaker, but the indie film is refreshingly different from the current movie norm, it's won more than 15 awards on the festival circuit, and war-movie aficionados will find it well worth the journey."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Well mounted, frequently gripping."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"The triumph here is a matter of craftsmanship rather than art, but it's rare enough even on that level for a film to be worth celebrating."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Thanks to an impressive cast of largely unknown actors, this small-scale, meticulously researched film tells its story with quiet conviction."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Inspired by actual events, Saints and Soldiers benefits by being a small-scale war movie."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,70,"Director-cinematographer Ryan Little neatly ratchets up the suspense while throwing emotional spotlights on the inner struggles of each combatant trapped in this hostile, frozen wilderness."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,63,"Wants to be an epic in the mold of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but it's hindered by its modest budget."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,63,"For a certain kind of moviegoer, Saints and Soldiers provides above-average nostalgia. Others, more hardened, might call it child's play."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,50,Shackles its characters with stale dialogue straight out of decades-old Sgt. Rock comic books.
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,50,"Too often, Saints And Soldiers confuses bravery for faith."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,50,"There's an uplifting message about heroism, dispensed in dialogue so familiar you can practically lip=synch it."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,40,"The thin backstory hints at a conflict between the religious convictions of the hero (helpfully named Deacon) and the demands of combat, but it never fully materializes; as it is, we mainly know that he's a Mormon because he doesn't smoke or drink coffee."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,40,"Despite all the life-threatening situations, warrior deaths and heroic feats, it's hard to get behind characters who feel like lazy archetypes."
Saints and Soldiers,6.8,1310470,40,That the film seems willing to erect a simple religious parable on such a moral morass is bewildering. That it should do so without accurately depicting the nightmare of Hitler's Europe is unconscionable.
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,63,"King Kong Lives, which was directed by John Guillerman, has a dull cast and a plot that's even duller, but the ape himself is in good form."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,50,Director John Guillermin loses all control of the pic.
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,40,"The problem with everyone in King Kong Lives is that they're in a boring movie, and they know they're in a boring movie, and they just can't stir themselves to make an effort."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,40,"In all fairness, there is a lot of camp value here. Fans of truly bad cinema couldn't ask for a sillier big-budget production--envisioned with the utmost seriousness."
King Kong Lives,3.8,4711220,38,"King Kong Lives is a terrible film, alternately boring and fascinatingly misguided. But it’s ragingly inessential more than anything else."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,88,"Even with the uniformly good performances — and the standout work from Ms. Green — 300: Rise of an Empire is foremost a triumph of production design, costumes, brilliantly choreographed battle sequences and stunning CGI."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,78,"While very much a “hard R” movie, Rise of an Empire is, nevertheless, the perfect sort of film for rainy weekend afternoons. It’s a spectacle right down to its shattered ships and duplicitous warcraft, and this time out the story’s been leavened and enlivened with plenty of old-school girl power."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,75,"300: Rise Of An Empire is a worthy sequel to ""300,"" stylistically consistent and equally loony, featuring what may well be the first truly can't-miss performance in a film this year."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,75,"The film belongs to Green — maybe the only actress ever to ""graduate"" from being a Bertolucci muse to a bloodthirsty action-flick dominatrix."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,70,"Rise of an Empire might have been essentially more of the same, but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor: Mere mortals of Athens, Sparta, and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis, behold the magnificent Eva Green, and tremble!"
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,70,"Anchored by Eva Green’s fearsome performance as a Persian naval commander whose vengeful bloodlust makes glowering King Xerxes seem a mere poseur, this highly entertaining time-filler lacks the mythic resonances that made “300” feel like an instant classic, but works surprisingly well on its own terms."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,Israeli director Noam Murro does an excellent job of managing and expanding the franchise established so vividly by Zach Snyder.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"Entirely more engaging by dint of being absolutely impossible to take even a little bit seriously. The ruthlessness of Green's character is taken to extremes that meld Medea to the cheesiest serial you can name, and is hence delicious."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,The lack of a creative driver behind the film leads to a level of fundamental dissatisfaction. The movie delivers all the necessary elements but their impact is dull.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,This is digital fake-ism all the way. Audiences bought it the first time; they're likely to buy it a second time.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"Green rules the picture with her nutty stare and her willingness to get nasty in a hot sex scene, but the movie’s main weak point is the Greek general Themistokles."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"The design... is stunning, an improvement over 2006′s “300.” And the action never disappoints. It’s a pity this colorless cast doesn’t hold a candle to the Butler/Headey/Michael Fassbender/David Wenham crew of the original, that the writers couldn’t conjure up thrilling speeches to match the original."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"For all the energetic milling, Rise of an Empire proves superior to its predecessor by making war a game both sexes can play, on nearly equal terms. In comparison, the R-rated ""300"" seems as innocent as Adam in the Garden before the delicious complication of Eve — or Eva."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"The spectacularly brutal fighting is the film's main calling card, and in that ""Rise of an Empire"" doesn't disappoint. Still, in the battle for best guilty pleasure, I'd give it to the Spartans of ""300,"" by a head."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"If 300’s human touch largely came down to Butler’s roaring and screaming, it’s left entirely to Green to goose the sequel into life. Happily she obliges."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"Just as bloody yet much more conventional, 300 #2 offers splashy thrills aplenty but fails to make a watertight case for its own existence. Green, however, ensures it stays afloat."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"It’s all extravagantly daft, moves at a fair clip and is over before you expect it to be."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,The best thing about the new 300: Rise of an Empire is that Zack Snyder didn’t direct it. And the worst thing about it is that Zack Snyder didn’t direct it.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,Stunningly shot and stupidly written.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,The naval collisions and melees play out in panel-like renderings that are bold and satisfying for the first half-hour but lack the momentum and bombastic je ne sais quoi of “300.”
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,"Basically, if the first “300” was a pep-talk from Coach on how to lose with dignity, Rise of an Empire is an inspirational speech on the value of teamwork."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,"Other than for the pleasure of watching Green try to conquer ancient Greece dressed as a distant forebearer of Catwoman, more is less and a little late in this long-aborning sequel."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"It really is pretty dull, though, with the same moments of campy silliness: the same frowning gym bunnies with the same digitally enhanced abs."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"The best thing about the movie, by far, is Green. Her Artemisia is a real nut case with a taste for blood, and Green is the only one in the cast who seems to be having any fun at all."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"The film feels epic in scope, visually at least, but the depth of its deep-focus composition is bitterly at odds with the flimsiness of its characterization and plotting."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,38,"By throwing herself headfirst into scenes that a more cautious actress might beg off, Green earns herself a citation for valour – a Purple Heart in a movie that’s otherwise way too grim and grey for its own good."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,33,"Forgettable and only mildly entertaining, 300: Rise of An Empire seals its own fate at the initial story level by being so deeply invested in its own mythmaking and playing super safe."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Both a prequel and a sequel to the original tale, only with more bloodspilling and slow-motion, and even less wit or truth."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"When the film isn’t sloppily directed, it’s a series of lazy filmmaking tics, including fetishistic slow-motion shots of blood, water and sweat, as well as sundry dismemberments, impalings and decapitations."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"""300"" was an innovative and imaginative action film, but the follow-up, 300: Rise of an Empire, is nothing but a disappointment."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Noam Murro gives the film nothing so much as a hit-refresh on the same glistening, impossibly golden and gray flecks of pixel-barf that have invaded the frames of every tent-pole studio release since the Bush administration."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Murro doesn’t so much direct as frame and stage, placing the characters against digital desktop-wallpaper skies and constructing each battle scene as a showcase for the characters’ prowess and toughness."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,20,"The only saving grace is Green, the reigning witch-queen of cinema. The smoky-eyed French actress, best known for “Casino Royale,” “The Golden Compass” and “Dark Shadows,” throws her all into the performance, going bare-chested at times, bared-teeth at others. She’s like Elizabeth Taylor’s ""Cleopatra"" possessed by a succubus — which is a good thing. Without her, 300: Rise of an Empire would be bloodless and brainless."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,0,The empty violence and pointless style are only the biggest problems.
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,80,More story-led than the original with a high enough body count to make it a satisfying action movie.
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,75,"Beautifully outfitted and moodily photographed, the movie is directed by Stephen Hopkins, the Jamaican-born Australian responsible for Nightmare on Elm Street V. He keeps the pedal to the metal but never allows the explosive action to minimize his actors."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,75,"Virtually everything about the film is derivative--even the design for the eerie setting for the climactic struggle recalls the interiors of the more exotic old movie palaces--but its makers can't be accused of cutting corners. No doubt about it, those who ask only for pure action will be getting their money's worth."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,63,"The film's energy and style are enough to recommend it. Lovers of the original should be pleased with this effort, as should most fans of the genre."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,60,"While the film doesn’t achieve the same thrills of the final 45 minutes of Predator in terms of overall excitement, it outdoes its first safari in start-to-finish hysteria. The real star is the pic’s design. Writers don’t waste much time on character development."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,60,"Since the predator is imaginary but the people who made this film are not, Predator 2 speaks sadly of their own lack of curiosity and imagination."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,60,"There is so much violence, as gangs kill gangs, or gangs kill cops, or the predator kills all of them, that it's hard to watch without the brain succumbing to self-protective numbness."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,50,"It's shoot-em-up action from start to finish, beginning at such a peak that there's hardly any room for the action to build or climax."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,50,"There are a couple of entertaining action sequences, including the climactic battle between the cop and the Predator. The special effects, all shot on film, and the makeup effects, are top-notch for the time they appeared, so as a historical record the movie is interesting. But it just doesn't have enough meat to sate a hungry hunter."
Predator 2,6.3,30669413,50,"The whole noisy movie is really just a setup for the climactic duel between renegade cop Danny Glover and the monster. By that point, you’re pathetically grateful for a few stomach-churning special effects."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,90,"Despite some of the sentimentality that is also Woo's stock-in-trade, I was moved and absorbed throughout."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,88,"It's the best new battle film since ""Black Hawk Down,"" a movie it surpasses in sheer feeling and bravura style, if not in nightmarish panic and suspense."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,83,"Cage is superb as a hollowed-out, ferocious man of action chasing his demons recklessly with machine gun firing away."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,80,"Well matched both to the material and each other, Cage and Beach capture Windtalkers' true struggle, the fight to hold on to values like honor, friendship, and tenderness in an environment that demands otherwise. This is as much a Woo trademark as the carefully orchestrated gunplay."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,80,"Windtalkers is the best of Woo's American movies, and the one with the sturdiest and most direct links to his earlier pictures."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,70,"Imaginative and frequently thrilling, and the love-hate relationship of its protagonists is quite compelling; Woo is always at his best in portraying the complexities of male bonding under intense pressure and violence."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,67,"Windtalkers blows this way and that, but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass, true to himself."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,67,"Capably made and certainly impresses by carrying its length, but it doesn't expand 60 years of World War II screen literature by very much."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,63,"The result is that the film comes across as preachy and clichéd. And, while the battle sequences are well executed from a technical point-of-view, they often seem repetitive and uninspired."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,63,"The code talkers and their guardians - Beach and Cage, Willie and Slater - do the best they can with the oddly flat-footed script, but their dynamics don't really have a place in Woo's universe."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,63,"While I don't always have the stomach for Woo's viscera or the heart for his pure, angelic heroes and impure, diabolical villains, I found myself responding to the context and subtext of Windtalkers while closing my eyes through what one might call its text. It's two-thirds of a great film."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,63,"Windtalkers is to movies what Paris is to weather -- if you don't like the show you're watching, just wait a minute and an entirely different picture will blow into view."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,63,This is the kind of film where you think you can predict everything thats going to happen upon the first shot and you spend the rest of the film praying that youre wrong. But its fun getting there.
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,63,"Not all it might have been, an oddly old-fashioned film from a director who's usually anything but."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,60,"We can only view Windtalkers with the same shaken detachment that characterizes Mr. Cage's Joe Enders, wishing that the codetalkers' real story, a little known and fascinating chunk of American history, had been given its true dramatic import."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"Despite some feints in a soulful direction, the picture has none of the interior quality of a multifaceted war film like Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line."" Woo is all about elegant surfaces, not inner conflicts."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"For all this potential, and the appealing presence of Nicolas Cage and newcomer Adam Beach, Windtalkers remains almost obstinately flat."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"The movie deals superficially with Native American pride and racism in the ranks, but it's hardly about the codetalkers at all: Neither Woo nor the screenwriting team of Joe Batteer and John Rice seem to appreciate the bitter irony in a Native American soldier protecting his land by serving the very government that took most of it from him in the first place."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"Know how to tell if a war movie is mediocre? An outspoken bigot, usually a Southerner, abuses a patient member of an oppressed minority -- the Asian recruit, the African American or, in the case of Windtalkers, a pair of Navajo men from Arizona in his platoon."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"Gets pinned down in a barrage of schmaltz, cliché, stereotype and racial condescension - not to mention a historically dubious premise."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,The Navajo code talkers have waited a long time to have their story told. Too bad it appears here merely as a gimmick in an action picture.
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute.
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,Cage is the only reason to check out an otherwise mediocre movie.
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"The script is riddled with so many clichés, you count on the battle scenes to wake you from your stupor."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,Woo could end up becoming the John Ford of schmaltz.
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"Woo's mainstreaming his vision here, and though Windtalkers has its moments of precious, awful clarity, it can't hold a candle to the man's earlier blood-soaked balletics."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"A powerful premise turned into a stubbornly flat, derivative war movie."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,50,"At once chintzy and grandiose, awash in battlefield sentimentality and platoon clichés."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,40,"In the studied excess of his Hong Kong action movies, Woo's swooning sentimentality plays like grand opera. With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap."
Windtalkers,6.0,40914068,40,"This is a great subject for a movie, but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity, using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,83,"2 Guns is a movie based on smart callbacks and sly flip-flops of loyalty, regularly interrupted by spasms of well-staged violence."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,83,2 Guns is a much-needed reminder that the best summer surprises can come when you least expect them.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,80,"Could this be the late-emerging hit movie of summer 2013? No chance, although if this was August 1987, a time when we allowed action films to be smart on their own dumb terms, it might have cleaned up."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,80,"For a movie with so many twists in it, 2 Guns never really jerks us around. This is what some summer movies should be like — clever in a stupid way, and stupid in a clever way."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,80,"Pure charisma is sometimes the best special effect. That’s what Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to 2 Guns, and after a season full of superhero duds, they deliver a crucial dose of cool."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,79,"In a season stuffed with empty eye candy, 2 Guns comes along as something of a welcome burrito — plenty satisfying and hardly nutritious."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"With a sharp and funny if sometimes convoluted script by Blake Masters and slick, pulpy direction from Baltasar Kormakur, and of course that first-rate cast, 2 Guns rises above standard action fare."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"You've seen all this before, and many times. 2 Guns works because it's essentially several riffs on familiar material. Cliché is not a bad thing if it's done right."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"Wahlberg, whose dim-bulb act was over-exposed in Pain and Gain, fares better here in a more heroic role. Stig is a hothead and a narcissist, but he’s also just a little bit smarter than he looks. The same goes for 2 Guns as a whole."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"The director mixes the colors of his palette carefully. He uses (but never overuses) slow-motion, aerial shots, extreme close-ups and quick cuts, avoiding any self-consciously “stylish” display. He varies the pace of scenes and the angle of shots enough to keep the movie flowing, but we never feel we’re watching someone show us how clever he is."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,75,"The movie is loud, fun, quick moving, and features some nice acting turns."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,Mr. Kormakur sets and keeps up a fast rather than frantic pace that never runs the movie off the rails even when the story nearly does.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,2 Guns is both enjoyable trash and a fascinating snapshot of Hollywood’s current mentality when it comes to the United States government.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,"Kormákur lets his stars balance the buddy-movie levity with just enough dramatic weight to keep it grounded, and his directing style seems like a conscious corrective to the disorienting cutting and obvious CGI effects that have come to dominate Hollywood action films."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,"The picture survives its excesses thanks to winning chemistry between stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, who animate banter-heavy dialogue and click so well one wonders why they haven't shared the screen before."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,70,"Kormakur shows he knows his way around an action movie better than most, keeping the pace quick, the banter lively and the old-school, mostly CGI-free thrills delivering right on schedule."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,67,"Maybe it’s just an expression of relief after a summer of superheroes and fantasy scenarios, but 2 Guns is a refreshing blast."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,63,"With border crossings and familiar buddy-cop movie tropes (think Lethal Weapon, think 48 HRS, think The Heat), the Wahlberg-Washington express hits lots of comfortably familiar notes. And more than a few viciously uncomfortable ones, too."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,63,"The actors — including Patton as Bobby's DEA colleague and sometime fling — cannot act what is not there. But with Washington, Wahlberg, Olmos and Paxton around jockeying for dominance, the standoffs have their moments."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,60,"This does a serviceable job homaging '80s actioners but not a whole lot more. Go for the explosions, zone out for the plot."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,60,"Washington and Wahlberg are an effective double act in an intermittently exciting thriller with more twists than it needs. We’d love to see them partnered again, though perhaps as characters."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,60,"Wahlberg and Washington are so good together, quips flying as fast as lead, that much is forgiven."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,58,It’s essentially a buddy-cop romp with the usual assortment pack of graphic gruesomeness.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,58,"As in ""Contraband,"" Kormákur offers a hint of a political statement, in this case about the inherent potential for corruption whenever competing government agencies are operating in international territory. But it doesn’t quite make it. On almost every level, 2 Guns is content to be as flavorless and forgettable as its title."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"Hypermacho but tongue-in-cheek, the first 20 minutes of 2 Guns are enormous fun."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"By its conclusion the story has worked so hard to be twisting and clever that it runs out of steam and becomes outlandish, marked by a surplus of violence — too often casual and gratuitous — for what essentially is a buddy cop movie."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,The movie has style but increasingly little sense.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,Savvy filmgoers will know they are getting a stale product as soon as they see the wrapper: one of those vintage muscle cars that screams “stakeout.”
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"The phrase “casting is everything” has never felt truer than it does with 2 Guns, an unremarkable, standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"Hell, I really meant to at least like 2 Guns. But I couldn't. The movie just didn't make the extra effort."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"Viewer/character solidarity only holds up for so long, and the film falls hard into twisty, nonsense territory, skipping over its stronger themes in the process."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,50,"This is a here today, gone tomorrow trifle, albeit one with lots of gunplay. In midsummer, that may be enough, but it's still a shame that 2 Guns shoots so many blanks."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,42,"There’s nothing about 2 Guns that doesn’t feel prefab, like someone poured a packet of Insta-Movie into a glass of water."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"There is a fair amount of not sufficiently witty or lovable banter, and Paula Patton gets to play Katharine Ross to their Butch and Sundance. She really has nothing to do except pose fetchingly in her underwear. Not much firepower."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"Complications escalate to a tiresome degree, leeching the fun from the movie, which is slung together with cold competence (and not much more) by jobbing Icelandic maverick Baltasar Kormákur."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"While Washington and Wahlberg help make sure the flawed 2 Guns isn't too bad, it's hard not to think that it could have been better."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"When does banter turn to blather? In the case of this action adventure, which was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, it's when you realize that keeping track of the barely fathomable plot isn't worth the bother."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"Though individual set pieces are well done, the film inevitably leaves an empty taste behind it once it's done."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"They’re cute together, these two big stars, but the film around them, a sort of Tarantino lite, is desperately empty."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,40,"2 Guns quickly degenerates into boilerplate Hollywood sound and fury, complete with a climactic Mexican standoff that revolves around a massive, burning pile of money. Irony, thou art lost."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,38,Not every movie can come from the heart: This one is from the crotch. But what’s left for the sequel? Maybe it’ll feature Mark and Denzel sporting matching leather codpieces or giving each other bikini waxes. We can only hope.
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,37,"2 Guns feels like it’s all been done before, whether by John Woo, Michael Bay or any number of their CGI-happy clones."
2 Guns,6.7,75612460,25,"It's a complete mess, the spectacle of filmmakers blowing up their movie and everything in it, because they can't think of anything else to do."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,50,"Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,Here is the horror-action genre at its silliest and most uninspired.

Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,"A fairly faithful adaptation of what a game is like, but without the pleasure of getting to play or the much-needed option of pressing the ""off"" button."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,30,"Director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) pulls off a nicely staged fistfight in an open-air market at the start, but soon loses his way amid mind-glazing exposition and endless gunfire aimed at bulletproof giant lizards."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"That this bit of pustulence is based on a video game of the same name is no surprise. It explains the thin plot, characters and abundant gunplay."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"Slater narrates as if reading a restaurant menu. Reid seems to have learned each long sentence in segments, so she wouldn't be overtaxed."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"Even Boll seems to lose interest as the story unravels. By that time, the supernatural cliches, plot inconsistencies, dead ends and red herrings have piled up so high you can barely see the screen."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"Director Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead"") has made a cottage industry out of this kind of junk. Maybe it's time for him to close up shop."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,25,"No better than whatever you might pick up while wearing a blindfold at Blockbuster, even if you happen to reach into a trash can."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,12,Think of the lamest horror movie you've ever seen. Now think of Tara Reid in the lamest horror movie you've ever seen. See how much worse it could have been?
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,12,Alone in the Dark will be the worst movie of 2005. The idea that anything could be worse is the only genuine scare the movie has to offer.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,10,One of those rare instances of a movie being so bad ... it's still really bad.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,10,"This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game, 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable, no matter what bad flick they're in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,10,"Tedious, derivative exercise, stolen from a dozen or so horror/action films."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,10,"An embarrassingly unscary monster mash, is desperate to frighten its laughing audience any way it can."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,"So inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn't release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,Brain-dead adaptation of a popular video game.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,Just Tara-ble.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,So mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,Supremely idiotic.
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,"Just as the book is usually better than the film, one suspects the video game is probably more entertaining and coherent than the movie. In the case of Alone in the Dark, this is a certainty."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,"Far be it from me to dismiss a man's effort (Uwe Boll) in a sentence, but the film on your teeth after a three-day drunk possesses more cinematic value."
Alone in the Dark,2.3,5178569,0,"It's just the most inept filmmaking you can catch in theatres right now, or probably all year long."

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,80,"The pacing is spot-on, the set-pieces memorable and all the characters are allowed to shine, without it ever becoming The Johnny Depp Show."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,75,"""Dead Men” works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue peppered with not particularly sophisticated but (I have to admit) fairly funny sexual innuendo."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,75,"Johnny Depp’s drunken Captain Jack Sparrow stumbles into yet another seafaring adventure, which has its rocky moments but also offers an engaging tale with family legacies, above-average swashbuckling and a fantastic new villain courtesy of Javier Bardem"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,70,"Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn’t rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley—creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that’s instantly forgettable. You know, like the ride itself."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg work up a stormy sea-parting finale that is better than anything in “The Ten Commandments.” Again, the trick to enjoying this film is to expect nothing."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"What we get is the usual mash of swashbuckling nonsense and soggy mythology: There will be romance, and revelations, and some silly gold-plated cameos (hello there, Sir Paul McCartney! And whoops, goodbye). Through it all, Norwegian duo Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (the Oscar-nominated Kon-Tiki) feel less like directors than shepherds."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"Kon-Tiki directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are at the helm this time around, proving capable captains even if the script they’re working from isn’t always seaworthy."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,65,"The fifth entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it’s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,It’s fast paced but goes nowhere new and the film’s “bigness” makes it hard to remember what an amazingly unexpected treasure The Curse of the Black Pearl was.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,"Much as Bardem enlivens things, the real source of zip is Kaya Scodelario (“Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials”). Charming and spirited, she’s Daisy Ridley dialed up a notch."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,"Kon Tiki directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg strike just the right tone, and found just enough heart left in this tattered tale."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales manages to be less bloated, dreary, and meandering than the last three entries have been, but it still suffers from many of the same wearisome, dredged-up villains and ho-hum action and comedy that have bedeviled the franchise since its second installment."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,I found Dead Men Tell No Tales to be passably fun and certainly no harder to watch than any of the better-pedigreed blockbusters this year.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), taking over from series regulars Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, doesn’t make much sense out of the typically (for the franchise) convoluted plot, but does manage to bring out a father-child theme that lends the film a little emotional resonance."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"The gonzo-Wagnerian backstory the franchise subsequently built up hasn’t been sufficiently pruned – and with so many characters to juggle, the story feels less like a coherent chain of events than a bundle of obligatory subplots."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"It's hardly original nor necessary, but it's a fun and absorbing escapade on the Seven Seas."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,58,"Waste enough of the audience’s time with the adventures of a couple of uncharismatic dinguses, and Depp’s stage-drunk, innuendo-laced, cabaret-emcee shtick starts to creep back into being funny."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"The most engaging performance is Javier Bardem’s solidly nasty Captain Salazar, the undead commander of a ghost ship. His disintegrating skin and holey crew are fabulously rendered as evaporating digitizations: It’s the special effects and swelling action sequences that make the movie palatable."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,The franchise has sadly devolved into a cynical cash grab.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,Those who go to see “Dead Men Don’t Tell Tales” might just recognize that hollow feeling as they leave the theater.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"Loud, overstimulating and hard to take in all in one sitting, it feels like the vacation that you’ll need a vacation from."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,Calling Dead Men Tell No Tales the most entertaining Pirates of the Caribbean movie since the original is a backhanded compliment with all the bilge water under the bridge since then. Time to deep six Capt. Jack Sparrow. This franchise should tell no more tales.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"The proportions of good parts to not are more generous than they’ve been in years, though there’s still much too much of the usual undead sea dogs killing their prisoners and rumbling on about curses."

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,42,"As the coldly calculated Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales proves, it is time to let this series rest in peace, or at the very least, spend the rest of its doomed, immortal days sinking to the bottom of the ocean."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"There are no new treasures to be found in this installment, which is dragged down by the anchor of a prescribed franchise blueprint."

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Not the return to form you might have been hoping for. Its story might cover all the same beats as the 2003 original, but there’s little of that film’s spark or spirit."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"The franchise has lost a bit of its luster with every successive installment, but never has a “Pirates” film felt this inessential, this depressingly pro forma."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Scodelario, of the Maze Runner films and Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights, is just about the only member of the cast who seems to believe she's expected to be more than a thin generic functionary or flamboyant scene-stealer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Unfortunately for everyone, Captain Jack Sparrow is still slurring and staggering around the Caribbean. Whatever charm and charisma Johnny Depp once had in this role is well and truly lost at sea."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Dead Men Tell No Tales moves at a faster rate of knots than any Pirates film; trouble is, nothing has really been added. It’s the same soggy ride, set to a marginally preferable speed."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,38,"Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (“Kon-Tiki”) seem to not have the slightest idea how to make this material sing; instead, it’s mostly a noisy, dark 3D blur in which the characters run around a lot, seemingly looking for the exits"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,33,"The film is not unlike a classic rock supergroup reuniting to play all the greatest hits, with the payday at the end as the only true motivation, rather than returning with something new to say about their work."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,30,It’s stuffed to the gills with effects executed by the highest-paid artists and technicians in the business. But it’s still a sorry spectacle.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,"It’s a little less cute these days to watch his Jack Sparrow swish about drunkenly, knowing the actor’s an abusive lush. Equally wearisome is the spectacle of a once-entertaining franchise staggering around, devoid of purpose."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,“Dead Men” is a jumble of half-baked impulses.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,0,"This movie is truly unhinged — not crazed, which might be interesting, but devoid of the usual hinges that connect one sequence with another."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,70,"I was at least able to follow the plot (which is not to say it wasn't as ludicrous as any Bond film -- just that I could follow it). But most of all this movie has camp value -- it's fun to sit there and make fun of every last detail, and that redeems it quite a bit."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,70,"Hard as it is to justify Bond films on intellectual grounds, there's something invigorating -- and strangely reassuring -- about this sort of picture. It is comforting to feel that should a psychopath threaten the stability of the world, our hero will be ready to wipe the grin off his face and shove him into San Francisco Bay."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,67,"Beyond Walken and Jones’ considerable contributions, A View to a Kill also contains a robust assortment of action sequences."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,63,"Even though Moore sleepwalks his way through the part, making it apparent that he should have departed two films ago, and Tanya Roberts can't act to save her life (although she certainly can scream), we're back to a more conventional, straightforward Bond than the convoluted mess of the previous movie."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,60,"Christopher Walken sleepwalks his way through playing smarmy Nazi geneticist Zorin, where you would think he would have a ball hamming it up as a Bond villain. Indeed, it is a rare moment when Grace Jones makes the biggest impression as an Amazonian (naturally) henchman called May Day."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"This jokey tone couldn’t be more different from the relative self-seriousness of helmer John Glen’s first 007 directing effort, For Your Eyes Only, and frankly, I yearn for more of that class."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"With Sean Connery as Agent 007, James Bond was a human-scale figure, an exceedingly cool guy to be sure, but a guy nonetheless. With Roger Moore as Bond, we are simply watching a lightweight actor stroll through a role."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"A View to a Kill plods along dutifully, observing the rules of the series with dull consistency."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"As lavishly escapist as they are, the latest James Bond films have become strenuous to watch, now that the business of maintaining Bond's casual savoir-faire looks like such a monumental chore."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"As for Bond’s glib wit, which has been running down lately, the screenwriters haven’t solved that problem. Some of his double entendres are older than Moore and one of them had to be used twice."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"Directed by John Glen (For Your Eyes Only), this movie has all the standard Bond components--beautiful women, picturesque locales, thrilling chases--but the time-tested formula is more than a little threadbare here. Moreover, Walken doesn't have the lines, the strength, the presence, or the dastardliness required to be a top-notch Bond adversary."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"Just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next. Even the tony cast of villains—Christopher Walken, Patrick Bauchau, and Grace Jones—can't add any flavor to the grindingly predictable proceedings."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"What's good? A mesmeric, bottle-blond Christopher Walken as Max Zorin, hellbent on global domination as a product of Nazi experiments, Grace Jones' zowie star at his henchman, and Duran Duran's title song. Otherwise, I'm out."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"If there is such a thing as a pulse in movies, there are sections of this one where a defibrillator would come in handy. This is not due to a lack of action scenes but those included are strung together with long, slow stretches."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,38,"There is some magnificent stunt work, which only underscores how inadequate Moore has become. Moore isn't just long in the tooth -- he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,38,"Bond struck camp long ago, so it would seem pointless to complain about the dilution of Fleming's cruel stud into a smirking dinner-jacket with a crude line in double entendres. But the problem here is that the elements which act as consolation in late Bondage are missing."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,90,A first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,88,"Blisteringly fast, Bourne also has a strong or striking supporting actor around every corner: Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in roles that range from meaty to amazingly small."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,88,"One of those rare thrillers where the cops aren't fools, villains don't turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,83,"Somehow the movie works like a clock. Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The full-throttle approach of director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go) is impressive."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,There isn't a dull or dumb moment in this movie.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,The result is an escapist fantasy that is -- Damon's and Potente's persuasive performances aside -- as weightless and inconsequential as a musical. And at the moment every bit as welcome.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The movie is a generic paranoid espionage fantasy, but its proportions are refreshingly correct. It moves quickly, adroitly, and without fuss."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"This is an entertainment that really entertains because any number of interesting and unexpected choices were made, starting with the selection of Doug Liman as the director."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Entertaining, handsome and gripping, The Bourne Identity is something of an anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism. It is, by today's standards, a modest thriller, with a self-contained storyline and with very few big special effects."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Liman packs enough firepower into The Bourne Identity to please the summer action fan, including a reshot climax that contains one of the niftier stunts I've seen recently. The centerpiece action sequence is a bravura car chase through Paris, yet the moments that bookend it are equally impressive."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The result is not only entertaining but also refreshing, a shameless crowd-pleaser with a healthy cynicism about itself."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,78,"A skillful action movie about a plot that exists only to support a skillful action movie. The entire story is a set-up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well-crafted and acted, we give it a pass. Too bad it's not about something."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts. The movie has credibility issues, but none are insurmountable in the name of entertainment."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Damon, starring in his first full-fledged action pic, brings a determined bearing and believability to the proceedings."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Though it's clearly meant to be character-driven, the movie is thrown out of whack by a total lack of chemistry between the leads, and some great acting (Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox) on the side."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Director Doug Liman -- the hip skipper of ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" -- makes all the familiar dirty business seem fun and almost human. In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"A lean, deftly shot, well-acted, weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures. There are even moments when you hope it could turn into a modern ""Charade."""
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"The problems with Damon's character are the problem with the movie: It's about plot mechanics, not heart and soul."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,This savvy adaptation of Robert Ludlum's action-clogged 1980 bestseller benefits from the fact that the filmmakers were smart enough to throw out most of the book's preposterous spills and thrills and concentrate instead on its intriguing central character.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,70,"May be a bloodless piece of thriller craftsmanship, but at a time when craft has become negligible, its efficiency and whipcrack timing are increasingly uncommon virtues."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,70,"As for Damon, this may not be a performance so much as an appearance. But he cares so utterly, it works."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,63,"Makes one interested in seeing the inevitable sequel, but one is also left to somewhat question the worth of sitting through this first installment."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,63,"It has a few whispers of intrigue, but at the heart of The Bourne Identity lies a dispiriting paradox: The more that Jason Bourne learns about himself, the less arresting he seems."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,"Films borrow tricks from pictures made years ago -- try to watch Bourne without thinking of ""The Manchurian Candidate."""
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,"Next time Damon will have to find a worthier vehicle. As the intended start of a franchise, The Bourne Identity is a bit of a bust."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,All this is diverting but also borderline dull.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,Banal big-budget adaptation of Robert Ludlum's 1980 espionage thriller.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,58,"The best audiences can hope for is that they, too, get amnesia and forget they ever saw this movie."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is some kind of miracle. It works on every imaginable level - as a heartfelt love letter to fans, an irresistible invitation to newbies, a visual marvel and a blockbuster of unparalleled emotional heft and cultural significance."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,The Force Awakens barrels back into Lucas' 'lived-in' universe with inextinguishable energy and boundless joie de vivre.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not perfect nor could it ever be. But for every niggle...there are 10 things that are exactly right, and it says much that no one will leave disappointed despite going in with hysterical levels of expectation."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Rarely have age and shining youth been juxtaposed more affectingly, but that’s only one of many moments of grace in a movie that mines its resonant mythology while moving its story ever forward."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The Force Awakens reveals surprising connections, begins a few bromances, solves mysteries while digging up others, and sets a strong tone for what comes next in Star Wars lore. Best of all? It’ll make you feel like a kid being introduced to something truly special once again."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The storytelling in The Force Awakens is masterful, in that it seems to be taking its time but is always moving relentlessly forward and coming up with surprises."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Perhaps the greatest triumph of Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that it justifies the enormous hype. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan, director J.J. Abrams (“Star Trek”) brings fresh energy to the franchise while adhering to the storytelling values that made it matter in the first place."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"From the off, JJ Abrams’s film sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past. That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"What a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising and heart-thumping adventure this is."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The rollicking, space-opera spirit of George Lucas’s original trilogy (you can safely forget the second trio of cynical, tricked-up prequels) emanates from every frame of J.J. Abrams' euphoric sequel. It’s also got an infusion of modern-day humor that sometimes steers the movie this close to self-parody—but never sarcastically, nor at the expense of a terrific time."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"It must have seemed like a nearly-impossible task when JJ Abrams and his collaborators set out to bring ""Star Wars"" back to life, but they've more than done it. They've made something honest and beautiful and, above all, fun, and I find myself energized by the movie and by the promise it represents."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The Force Awakens is ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity. What a Christmas present."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,91,"If the sequels to “The Force Awakens” are as good as this film, that will probably be because they follow the same formula: heavy on the human side, more comedy, less CGI, more fresh faces, and more delightful droids. And, yes, one must pay homage to the Force."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,"All you really want to know is whether it's good, right? Well, in fact, it is better than it had to be."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,"What Abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round: fun...There are some laugh-out-loud moments here, but also some touching ones. Happy, sad, exciting, silly — all that is included, along with the original sense of Saturday-morning-serial abandon that made what became known as “A New Hope” so wonderful all those years ago."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,"Mr. Abrams may be as worshipful as any Star Wars obsessive, but in The Force Awakens he’s made a movie that goes for old-fashioned escapism even as it presents a futuristic vision of a pluralistic world that his audience already lives in. He hasn’t made a film only for true believers; he has made a film for everyone (well, almost)."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,Abrams and his collaborators have made a movie that feels resoundingly fresh and new by paying tribute to a style and story that is decades old.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"The action, from lightsaber duels to X-wing dogfights with TIE Fighters, is explosive and buoyed by John Williams' exultant score. And the movie is also funny as hell. Abrams knows how to build a laugh and fill the emotional spaces between words."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"The film ultimately runs up against the limitations of its own nature.... But it’s still an exhilarating ride, filled with archetypal characters with plausible psychologies, melodramatic confrontations fueled by soaring emotions, and performances that can be described as good, period, rather than ""good, for 'Star Wars.'"""
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"If Hollywood’s going to extend the most famous movie myth of the past 40 years, The Force Awakens seems a worthwhile way to do so."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"Abrams understands what George Lucas never quite figured out: that we’re less interested in the science fiction future than we are in revisiting the past. We don’t really want to see what happens next in that galaxy far, far away. We want to recapture what it felt like the first time we arrived, in 1977, with a movie called “Star Wars.” We want to go home. Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes us there."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"Star Wars is fun again. Fans whose love for the series was forged with the Original Trilogy will see too much they recognize (and, later, missed) not to love this effort."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"The Force Awakens accomplishes its fan base mission, bringing back a modern myth with the torch-passing respect it deserves (plus some crass commercialism it doesn't)."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"The ending he’s come up with for The Force Awakens feels so perfect it’s hard to imagine it any other way. In an age when we’ve all become binge watchers, we feel as if it’s become our right to immediately roll right into the next episode, the next sequel. And when The Force Awakens ends, it’s bittersweet because you so badly want to head right into the next chapter."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"Snazzily directed by J.J. Abrams with vibrant effects and a busy plot that sets the whole franchise in motion all over again, The Force Awakens delivers on expectations with a fun, polished space odyssey that embraces the appeal of the originals."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,"Like their Star Wars forebears, Boyega’s Finn and Ridley’s Rey are brave, funny, and admirable but also imperfect, uncertain, and sometimes afraid. That is to say, they’re genuine, multisided characters with believable motivations—no small victory in a movie designed with the express purpose of breaking world box-office records."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,"Robustly entertaining while carrying the weight of impossible audience expectations, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fascinating, often satisfying mixture of rollicking mythmaking and fan service."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,"Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn’t work in Lucas’ prequels, and he’s gone in the opposite direction. He’s also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,Star Wars: The Force Awakens pumps new energy and life into a hallowed franchise in a way that both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,You would have to be practicing some pretty dark arts to not smile as you watch the iconic Millennium Falcon take off into battle one more time.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,The prequels this ain’t. We can all breathe again.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not a great film, but it flirts with that designation far more often than this lapsed fan could have ever expected. If, on a creative level, what’s contained herein is ultimately the planting of seeds that will continue growing two, four, or forty years down the line, I suspect this franchise is in its best-ever state. How fortunate that it also stands alone as a good time at the movies."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"The Force Awakens is half reboot, half remake, and all fun."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,So what’s the final verdict? A mixed bag. It’s a good start to a new trilogy but hardly the hoped-for masterpiece. It’s a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the ‘70s and ‘80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Ridley is the picture’s real find. Her Rey is fearless, forceful, resourceful, and with a hidden side to her personality that slowly manifests itself and will surely be more deeply explored in the sequels."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. Filled with incident, movement and speed, dusted with light layers of tarnished “used future” grime, it captures the kinetic energy that made the first film, from 1977, such a revelation to filmgoers who marveled at Lucas’s mashup of B movies, Saturday-morning serials, Japanese historical epics and mythic heft."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"If Abrams didn't take many chances, he didn't make many mistakes, either. First, Do No Harm became Don't Mess With Success, and it worked. Show Me the Money is sure to follow."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"It is good. Not great. But far better than ""not bad."" Solidly, confidently good."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Abrams makes big decisions and takes chances that command respect, especially in the very safe current tentpole film industry, but he doesn’t always quite sell them as he could. Still, as this new chapter props the franchise back up on sturdy legs, the Force seems to be in capable hands with a fresh forward direction."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Abrams and Kasdan’s respective humor and pathos push the characters beyond some of the more rote and redundant storytelling. So while it’s not always compelling, it’s always fun."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"What Abrams has done is strip Star Wars down to its core components, rearranging the stuff people liked about the original trilogy and getting rid of what they hated about the rest."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"By temperament, Abrams is more of a Spielbergian than he is a Lucasite. His visual wit may not be, as it is for Spielberg, a near-magical reflex, but nor is Abrams suckered into bombast by technological zeal, as Lucas has been, and the new movie, as an act of pure storytelling, streams by with fluency and zip. To sum up: “Star Wars” was broke, and it did need fixing. And here is the answer."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"The movie has already blown away advance-sale records, and when you go (which, of course, you will) I bet you’ll have fun — I did, mostly. But it’s the fun of seeing something fairly successfully redone, with the promise of more of the same to come."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steers the franchise back to its popcorn origins. It's not a Bible; it's a bantamweight blast. And that's just as it should be: a good movie, nothing more."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"Although Star Wars has always been about the past, The Force Awakens is ironically at its best when it looks the future."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"The reassuring familiarity of Abrams’ approach has its limitations: Marvelous as it is to catch up with Han Solo, Leia and the rest of the gang, fan service takes priority here over a somewhat thin, derivative story that, despite the presence of two appealing new stars, doesn’t exactly fire the imagination anew."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,67,"Still, as a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard Star Wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters, The Force Awakens is exactly what it needs to be: an old-school Saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,It exists less as a meaningful extension of its world than as a fan-service deployment device.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,"What’s missing in The Force Awakens – and this is a major, critical flaw – is a fresh story template, a plot that doesn’t build toward a climax you’ve already seen, played out in practically the exact same way. That’s the kind of failing that a lot of fans will overlook while they bask in the undeniable bliss-out the movie delivers. But in hindsight, as you play the film back in your mind, the huge lack of imagination and freshness become more problematic."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,"The shamelessness with which Star Wars: The Force Awakens replays the franchise’s greatest hits is startling. To put it another way, it’s a satisfying meal — but it’s $200 million worth of leftovers."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,It tells a well-crafted story; the new characters are invigorating; the old characters are reintroduced tidily. But it is also far too enamoured with the power of its own history.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,60,"When you’ve been charged with reviving one of the most obsessively beloved franchises in modern movies, is it better to defy expectations or to meet them? With Star Wars: The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams splits the difference, and the movie suffers—in the end, it’s perfectly adequate, hitting every beat. But why settle for adequacy?"
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,60,"You can choose to understand The Force Awakens as an embrace of the mythological tradition, in which the same stories recur over and over with minor variations. Or you can see it as the ultimate retreat into formula.... There are moments when it feels like both of those things, profound and cynical, deeply satisfying and oddly empty."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,60,"Though a definite improvement on the last three abortive Star Wars prequels directed by series creator George Lucas, The Force Awakens is only at its best in fits and starts, its success dependent on who of its mix of franchise veterans and first-timers is on the screen."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,50,"The Force Awakens boils down to a couple of genuine lump-in-the-throat moments, and those are due to nostalgia. The rest? Seen it, done it, been there, and remember it — even though it was “a long time ago.”"
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,80,"Making excellent use of Nolte's controlled toughness and Short's hysterical freneticism, Weber plays the comic action hard and fast, grounding the humour in believable reality that has spiralled out of control."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,70,"Despite its herky-jerky pace and aimlessness of plot, Three Fugitives is engaging sport, primarily enjoyable for the hearty teamwork of Nolte and Short -- a comedic contretemps as bruising as a Punch and Judy show."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,63,"Given such a cloying and utterly predictable plot, it's surprising that Three Fugitives works as well as it does. Nolte, all big shoulders and bashfulness shows a pleasant self-deprecating talent and copes very well with the array of humiliations ranged against him."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,60,"As for the Nolte-Short pairing, it’ll do, but it’s no chemical marvel. Nolte, not really a comic natural, gruffs and grumbles his way through as hunky straight man to Short’s calamitous comedian."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,60,"This comedy has the earmarks of humor and even a few genuine laughs, but it also has a prefabricated, automatic-pilot feeling."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,"This obvious attempt to tap into the same audience that flocked to THREE MEN AND A BABY (indeed, it could have been titled ""Two Men and a Toddler"") is about as lifeless as they come. Not only is THREE FUGITIVES a scene-for-scene remake of Veber's French original, it is actually shot for shot the same film. Not surprisingly, the resulting film feels mechanical, despite engaging performances from Short and Nolte."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,"Nick Nolte and Martin Short make a frequently hilarious odd couple, but the film itself is shamelessly sentimental and often slapdash."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,"It would be wrong to blame Martin Short alone for the failure of Three Fugitives. Francis Veber, the French filmmaker who wrote and directed the film, must accept much of the responsibility."
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,50,The film never adequately uses either the dramatic talents of Nolte nor the comic talents of Short. The young girl (Sarah Rowland Doroff) is most effective because she rarely speaks.
Three Fugitives,6.1,40590000,40,"Francis Veber's Three Fugitives, a heist caper, starts off with comic promise then limps all the way from the bank."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,80,"Mark Robson's Earthquake is an excellent dramatic exploitation extravaganza, combining brilliant special effects with a multi-character plot line which is surprisingly above average for this type film. Large cast is headed by Charlton Heston, who comes off better than usual because he is not Superman, instead just one of the gang."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,70,"For those who have a soft spot for calamity pictures, there's a sense of ritual cleansing afterward. And for some reason, it also made me hungry."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,60,"Flat, generally laughable hokum, and the film ends up nowhere near as interesting a comment on the psychological aspects of disaster as Juggernaut."
Earthquake,5.9,79700000,60,Awful disaster movie that combined the worst elements of soap opera with special effects (bad matte paintings and the ridiculous Sensurround)--featuring an all-star cast that should have stayed home and waited for a real earthquake.
Default,4.3,3750000,50,"The film is stronger with its moment-to-moment tension than with its cynical, shallow media satire."
Default,4.3,3750000,42,"There is a better, more contemplative movie to be made with this material, but with Brand and the filmmakers opting for cheap thrills, it leaves the movie, like the passengers on the plane, stuck on the tarmac."
Default,4.3,3750000,40,Default’s search for ultra-realism ironically starts to make it look ultra-artificial.
Default,4.3,3750000,30,Director Simon Brand devotes so much running time to fear-mongering and grotesque stereotypes that a last-ditch effort at moral ambiguity and a critique on muckraking barely register.
Default,4.3,3750000,30,"It sacrifices its voice to the premeditated non-style of a first-person pseudo-documentary, a form that often has the paradoxical effect of making everything it shows us seem more fake than usual."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Smart, wry and awesome, all at once."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"What ensues is never exactly unpredictable, but always witty, fresh and fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Actually lighter, wittier, and more original than it has a right to be."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Savvy without being smug, cute without being saccharin, and funny without slipping into over-the-top goofiness, this is a 14th-century good time."

A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"A Knight's Tale, will either repel you or win you over. It won me over."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"With its cheerful hailstorm of anachronisms and classic-rock soundtrack, there's nothing medieval about it."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"More often than not, it's fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"It's a reminder of the days before films got so cynical and unrelentingly violent. A Knight's Tale is whimsical, silly and romantic."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,Simply a jolly good (k)night out.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,It's a dumb summer movie done with smarts.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,The action scenes are beautifully mounted and photographed and offer a sense of the rigors of the sport.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,"Smirking at the audacity of it all is part of the fun, and if nothing else, A Knight's Tale is a hell of a lot of fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,Fine family entertainment.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,"There's much to love about this ""Rocky"" on horseback, and those laughable blemishes just fold into jokes that Helgeland likely intends audiences to laugh at."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,67,"The result is half Python, half Ivanhoe--and not as much fun as either."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,Would be sweeter if the fair maiden weren't such a pill and more exciting if the villain weren't quite so nasty.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"The picture itself is good-humored, but bland and predictable. It's a cross between an All-American vaudevillian version of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Mel Brooks's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights."""
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"Laddish, one joke, genre scrambling rock & roll fairy tale."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"For all its hipness, the movie serves up some awfully old chestnuts."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"From the moment he trudges through the woods in his scratched and smudged birthday suit, Paul Bettany as a saucy Geoffrey Chaucer takes command."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"This brazen mix of old and new is undermined by the predictable story, shallow characterizations and a dopey sense of humor."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"As advertised, A Knight's Tale does try to rock you. The problem is, it doesn't rock you nearly enough."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,58,Works neither as an exuberant rock 'n' roll picture nor as a heroic fable. It will rock you --straight to sleep.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"At best harmless, if not quite fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,The result is as flat as a year-old beer commercial.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"Traditionalists and older viewers in general will scoff, while pop culture addicts will no doubt go with the flow."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"The film's one saving grace is Ledger (Mel Gibson's son in ""The Patriot"")."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,40,"The skits are dreadful, the jokes suck."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,70,"Home of the Brave isn't exactly a subtle or a delicate picture -- it's an old-fashioned Hollywood movie, at least in tone, that's being released like an indie -- but it has some terrific acting and comes straight from the heart."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,63,"While Mark Friedman's script is as unsubtle as Winkler's direction, their sincerity and the subject's sharp immediacy lend the film a certain power."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,60,"Timeliness is all very well, but the significant subject matter cries out for a defter directorial touch and a deeper complexity in regard to the characters and performances."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Evenness of political keel, combined with a generic filmmaking style, is an artistic weapon way too puny for a successful assault on so tough, bruising, and crucial a subject."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Had Home of the Brave presented credible stories about believable characters, it might have been a powerful drama."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Home of the Brave is a milestone of sorts. But it's a formulaic, overacted piece of work that rarely delves deep."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"The movie's mild-mannerness is especially disappointing when compared with such documentaries as ""The War Tapes"" and the excellent ""Home Front,"" vivid and incisive explorations of post-Iraq anger and disillusionment that have gone largely unseen by a disinterested public. If Americans are suffering from Iraq fatigue, Home of the Brave will do little to rouse them."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"Starts with a bang and ends in a long, protracted whimper."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,50,"The best thing about the movie is that it's interested in the soldiers, not the self-serving popinjays who seem to think the war is a big fat career-enhancing photo opportunity. The people who got shot at deserve most of the attention."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,40,As sincere as a three-legged puppy.
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,40,"As this cautious, politically evenhanded movie grinds along like clockwork, the fuse that should spark an emotional explosion fizzles after some sporadic hisses and sputters."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,38,The apolitical and well-meaning Home of the Brave is predictable and maudlin.
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,38,"By straining to make a respectful war film for everyone, Winkler and Friedman have wound up with a toothless picture that won't satisfy anyone."
Home of the Brave,5.6,49753,33,"Whatever its model, the film is assembled from much poorer material, leftover parts of Lifetime movies and well-meaning indie films seen only on opening nights at some forgotten festival in Tampa."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,"Yes, it's fundamentally business as usual, but it's the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form. Abrams imports and enlarges ""Alias'"" smooth, stylish, yet remarkably visceral approach to action, and the actors pack a satisfying amount of drama into the moments between action scenes."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,"A gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,It's an expertly engineered popcorn movie - hold the butter substitute - but it also tries (and fails) to be a love story for the ages.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,80,"It's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot. Summer has arrived."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,78,"Bury the nostalgia. Like the rap twist Kayne West puts into the film's classic theme, this movie is best when it stirs it up."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,Against sizable odds -- a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed -- Mission: Impossible III delivers.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"The supporting cast, including Ving Rhames, Laurence Fishburne and gorgeous Maggie Q, is underused, but the movie delivers the goods."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"In Mission: Impossible III, we find out whether it's still possible to look at Tom Cruise and not see a weirdo. The answer is yes, but a complicated yes, because it takes time."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"The end result is the very definition of a summer movie: breezy, undemanding and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"It's overwrought and overplotted, but it's plenty of fun."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Big and fast and silly, but it's never dumb, and it's certainly never boring, either. The summer movie onslaught has begun on a high note."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Unlike the previous two films in this series, Abrams is more concerned with his hero's heart than with his hardware. The result is a pulse-racing thriller that restores the human factor to the franchise, and to its producer-star."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Though Abrams doesn't possess a fraction of the visual pizzazz of the two previous MI directors, Brian De Palma or John Woo, his incarnation is, from a narrative perspective, better made."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"In his feature debut, ""Lost"" creator J.J. Abrams, who got the job on the basis of ""Alias,"" takes the driver's seat with both feet on the accelerator."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"For all its far-fetched formulations, this new entry maintains more of a dramatic throughline and has the bonus of a villain played with unsparing meanness by Philip Seymour Hoffman."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Cruise is probably the most graceful physical performer to occupy the screen since Burt Lancaster, and in this sort of action role, he's just about peerless...He may not be a great actor, but to find a greater movie star would be a nigh impossible mission."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,Hoffman is so proficient in this role that he just about overmatches Cruise and makes the wait until he speaks again in the second half of the film hard to endure with any patience.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Abrams keeps the action clicking along in 5/8 time, and Cruise is at his scowling/smiling best as he jumps, shoots and leaves. (See Tom run! Run, Tom, run!) Best is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the baddie; the film's best sequence features him playing Cruise playing him at a swank party in Vatican City."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"In the world of bloated movie-star vehicles, it's not unusual to see an ego trip of these dimensions. What’s rare is when one hits its marks so smoothly."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"M:i:III accomplishes its mission: to run smart variations on dumb tropes. After all, summer movies are not for students but for thrill consumers. Devour and enjoy."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"A film that climaxes in Shanghai shouldn't go down like a meal in Shanghai. But an hour after you see M:i:III, you may be hungry for a real movie."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Shallow to its core and as propulsive as a runaway locomotive, it's the most blatantly summer movie-ish of the Mission Impossibles. And also, surprisingly, the most viscerally entertaining."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Mission: Impossible III hasn't the kinks or the oddball Continental chic of the first ""Mission: Impossible,"" but it's less pretentious and obsessively pretty than the second movie."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,67,"Though dated and unsophisticated compared to the much cooler Bourne spy thrillers, M:i:III will probably hit the sweet spot at the box-office - and give Cruise a whole new reason to start jumping on couches."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"One of Cruise's most deeply cherished ambitions is to be a great actor, and this movie goes to great lengths to let him do that--sort of. You'll understand what I mean during the sequence in which there is more than one Philip Seymour Hoffman on the screen."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Maybe it's foolish to be disappointed by a pure popcorn movie, but as I walked out of this film, I felt it had failed in its mission of pure entertainment."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"The real objective of all the ""M:I"" movies is to provide a clothesline for sensational action scenes. Nothing else matters, and explanatory dialogue would only slow things down. This formula worked satisfactorily in ""M:I,"" directed by Brian De Palma, and ""M:I II,"" directed by John Woo, and I suppose it works up to a point in M:I III, directed by J.J. Abrams, if what you want is endless, nonstop high-tech action."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Only theoretically, though, is this exciting. Mostly, it all feels like a lateral move that keeps alive a franchise without breaking new ground."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"An inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action gives you an idea how good the franchise could be, but we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"The movie raises your pulse, it has visual wow. But I suspect that audiences will emerge into the light feeling more battered than entertained."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Producer-star Tom Cruise handed this one to alumni from the TV spy drama ""Alias,""  and the result is nearly as good as the series' best, Woo's Mission: Impossible 2."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"M:i:III, like many blockbusters, would be nothing without its star."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"While all the ""Mission"" plots are convoluted and slightly preposterous -- the keyword in the title is ""Impossible"" -- the latest is just this side of insultingly stupid. The longer you think about it, the less sense it all makes."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Absent the real sense of creepiness and highly honed film craft of De Palma, or the strong visual and emotional sensibility of Woo, M: I III feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films -- saddled, moreover, with a star who's sliding into self-parody."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Clearly designed to be an action thriller with emotional underpinnings. But you can't get blood from a stone, no matter how hard you squeeze. And so Cruise, a huge box-office star, is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of Mission: Impossible III."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Mr. Hoffman enlivens Mission: Impossible III, which otherwise droops, done in both by the maudlin romance and by Mr. Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent -- evident in his capacity as the television auteur behind ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" -- to a larger canvas."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,58,"Watching this movie is like sitting on your couch for two hours to catch a little network prime time: you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you’ll remember any of it five minutes later. On the plus side, you probably won’t care."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,58,"Aside from a single jazzy image of Hunt taking a nosedive off a Shanghai skyscraper, Abrams' movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for Woo's cartoon absurdities."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"A kicky, twisted thrill ride, with enough laughs to leaven what can be read, at heart, as a metaphor for the modern marriage."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"Expertly tossing off the type of well-sharpened banter that was the domain of Gable and Lombard and Tracy and Hepburn, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie -- no matter what their off-camera status -- make one swell combative couple."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"A full-on action flick, subversive rom-com and weapons-grade star vehicle that’s drenched in Tinseltown glitz, from a director who knows how to put the money on the screen while his tongue’s firmly in his cheek."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,A cool summer thriller whose laughs don't slow down the suspense.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,Plays like an old-fashioned romantic comedy with updated hardware.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"Jolie and Pitt project more than just body heat. They convey a multi-faceted attraction, toss off clever repartee and dazzle audiences with their seemingly natural connection. And that's worth watching."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,The screen smokes with sexual heat. But what's really erotic is how much fun the actors seem to be having.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"What makes the movie work is that Pitt and Jolie have fun together on the screen, and they're able to find a rhythm that allows them to be understated and amused even during the most alarming developments."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"Alas, around about the third act, the idea grows tired and the whole thing gets derailed. Too bad, because it's a good ride until it isn't."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,Features some of the best fight and chase footage you'll see all summer.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"In the end, star charisma and Liman's style win us over and we relax into a sophisticated summertime diversion that is noticeably intended for adults."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"There's a car chase that's more fluid and inventive than the much-touted freeway sequence in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" and the stars are nimble enough to make their acrobatics credible--no matter how many stunt doubles the picture employed."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"As he proved with ""The Bourne Identity,"" director Doug Liman can devise an enjoyable little action movie."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Some people will see Mr. and Mrs. Smith as cynical, but I think its heart is deeply romantic, admittedly in an anvil-on-the-head kind of way. It's a love story not for the faint of heart. In other words, it's a lot like marriage."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"The fact that Pitt and Jolie have not been associated with this type of action is something of a help, but what was needed was the off-balance tickle that--to fantasize--Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell would have given it."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Imagine ""The War of the Roses"" remade as a James Bond fantasy, with appropriately high-tech weaponry, and you have some idea of what Doug Liman's heavily armed comedy has in store."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"A tongue-in-cheek allegory on the hazards of harboring secrets in a relationship, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is most entertaining when the Smiths are hell-bent on mutual annihilation."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Here is ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" inflated to lethal proportion, or ""The War of the Roses"" reimagined as World War III."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,67,"For all the nimbleness of its first half and the chemical zing of Pitt and Jolie, the film devolves into a fractious and explosive mess, hitting the same note of ''ironic'' violence over and over."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,63,Mr. & Mrs. Smith kicks off with panache and star power - and quickly wears out its welcome.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,63,"The problem with Mr. and Mrs. Smith is that it's really two movies in one. The first is a sly comedy/thriller worthy of Hitchcock, and the other is a big, noisy summer action flick."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,60,An exhaustingly elaborate romantic fantasy actioner.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,60,"If the two most gorgeous people in the world alternately bantering and making out isn't enough to compel the attention of the average American moviegoer, then we are truly doomed."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,58,"Pitt coasts through the movie in second gear. I have no idea what he's trying to accomplish with his tight-lipped, low-key performance; maybe he's angling to replace Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible IV."""
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"It's a perfect role for Jolie, whose seductive looks always seem to be concealing something dangerous, even predatory, and she brings out a looseness in Pitt, who fares much better in comedic roles than when playing things straight and stoic (i.e. Troy)."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,Only Vince Vaughn registers hilariously as John's boss.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"An action comedy for suburban women that's as toothless as a newborn, and nearly as stupid. It tries so hard to be cute that it practically drools on your shoulder."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"Maybe my priorities are wrong, but this inquiring mind wants to know when these two will find a movie entirely worthy of his understatement and her naughtiness. This one has its moments, but it's also littered with action-flick junk."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"By the time the film winds itself up, the sophisticated fizz of its first 45 minutes has been smothered by explosive bombast."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"Uneven, ineffective mash-up of sex comedy and artillery-heavy action."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,Jolie has a gangly inelegance that suggests a giraffe trying to hang wallpaper -- but the entire movie is predicated on a spark between its prettier-than-thou stars that seems to have bypassed the screen and ignited in the tabloids instead.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,This romantic-comedy action movie is a fizzle.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing and occasionally incoherent action. Sometimes Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,"To watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which continually sacrifices its potential for sophisticated fun on the altar of style and physical stunts, is to realize how far we've come from the great movies of, say, George Cukor or Howard Hawks."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,"The movie is a technological and publicity triumph, and a calamity in every other way."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,It's hard to know what these stars are ready for after this fiasco. Maybe a fitness video.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,38,A deeply stupid and offensive action comedy-romance.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,30,"The movie is a mish-mash of action-adventure clichés, book-ended with lame attempts at psychological interest. Written, directed, and acted with ham-fisted heaviness."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,25,"It may be emblematic of new-millennium Hollywood that this movie has turned out to be one more emotionless, brainless, overproduced action film."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,25,"The film is glossy, but awful. Frenetic, but awful. Expensive, but awful. ... And awful."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,75,"A sly, self-mocking sense of humor is apparent even in Robocop 2's title, which identifies both the film's sequel status and its hero. And what a fantastic nightmare creation Robocop 2 is."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,75,"Everything in the first movie is pretty much redone again. But in this case, the repetition isn't a bad thing. It's par for the coarse. The original had such effortless, classic-trashy appeal, there's little reason to buck the self-made system. It works. It can continue. It does continue."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,63,"This ultraviolent, nihilistic sequel has enough technical dazzle to impress hardware fans, but obviously no one in the Orion front office told filmmakers that less is more."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,63,"I didn't much like RoboCop 2 (the use of that killer child is beneath contempt), but I've gotta hand it to them: It's strange how funny it is, for a movie so bad. Or how bad, for a movie so funny."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,63,"Nastiness in a movie can sometimes be liberating and fun, but the nastiness in RoboCop 2 is no more authentic than its heart."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,60,"Kershner's direction is never more than adequate, and the story seems full of unfulfilled promise and tangled threads. It's also deeply, disturbingly violent in a way which is more manipulative than gory; unlike the original, with its prophetic vision of the future, this sequel seems to spend too much time glorying in the very horrors it has outlined."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,60,"With its desensitizing blood lust, RoboCop 2 contributes yet another ugly note to this already demoralizing season of sadism. If things continue as they have until now, the body count at the movies may reach into the millions."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,"Kershner's accomplishment in the first half of RoboCop 2--which offers up the original's mixture of crunching action, dystopian satire and depraved villainy--is the genuine pathos this conflicted tin man evokes. But a curious thing happens to this sequel. It forgets what it's about. In the last third of the movie, the character of RoboCop vanishes behind his visor, the script loses its focus, and the special effects take over."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,"If you like to stagger away from a film feeling numb and slightly sick, this one's for you."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,"It's difficult to imagine a summer film programmed more cynically than this repugnant sequel. RoboCop 2 is all machine, and it's all vile."
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,The story wanders all over the place without purpose other than to shock with violence.
RoboCop 2,5.8,45681173,50,RoboCop 2 is every bit as sadistic as its 1987 predecessor but considerably less effective.
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,75,The tale of a down-and-out detective and a seamy femme fatale is a thoroughly professional little entertainment.
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,75,"Kill Me Again doesn't look like the noir classics; instead of black-and-white, it's shot in slightly muddy color with vagrant green tints. But it feels like them. It has that nerve-jangling mix of pungent cynicism and thick gobs of pseudo-Expressionist style. It's not brilliant or original, but it's still a lean, fast, wide-awake sleeper."
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,70,"Derived from assorted Hitchcocks and noir classics, the tortuous storyline of writer-director Dahl's determinedly sordid thriller has its moments, but the whole thing is fatally scuppered by the Kilmer pairing."
Kill Me Again,6.3,283694,60,"Well-crafted and competently acted, Kill Me Again is anything but a terrible film; however, like so many other films that have struggled mightily to pay homage to the great films noir of the past, it fails to come to life on its own terms."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,60,"Thank heavens — or at least the “Department of Eternal Affairs” — for Jeff Bridges, whose hilariously free-associative performance as a 19th-century frontier marshal-turned-21st-century undead lawman is like an adrenaline shot to the heart of R.I.P.D."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,58,"While he's (Bridges) having more fun than anyone in the audience is likely to be having, it's such a rip-snorting go-for-broke performance that it almost makes R.I.P.D. worth the price of admission. Almost."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,50,"Nothing short of wiping their memories with a real-life neuralizer is going to convince moviegoers that the supernatural buddy-cop comedy R.I.P.D. is anything more than a thinly disguised ""Men In Black"" ripoff."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,50,"A film that grows less compelling and original by the minute, R.I.P.D. serves due notice that the mismatched-buddy-cop movie is wearing out its welcome all over again."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,40,"Confusing and uninspired rather than completely inept, it’s still likely to be swiftly struck from the résumés of all involved."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"R.I.P.D. devotes far more energy to concept than execution, leaving most of the promising aspects high and dry."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"There is less eye candy than you would expect, and it’s underwhelming."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"In R.I.P.D., we have a legitimate train wreck of a motion picture: a film that doesn't work on any level. It's not funny. It's not exciting. It's not engaging. It's a waste of time and money."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,"Perhaps there was a clever germ of an idea here, but the five credited writers didn't develop characters, scenarios or rules in this sci-fi world well enough to engage the audience."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,38,The worst comic book adaptation since “Jonah Hex.”
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,36,"There is a legitimate film in here somewhere, buried deep beneath the rubble of its terrible script and editing."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,"With its low-stakes chase scenes, obvious-from-the-get-go villains and nonsensical plotting, this feels more like a 96-minute-long episode of Scooby-Doo that's been laboriously translated into another language and then back into English."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,It's an unpleasant way to pass a couple summer hours.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,"Unfortunately, the interesting drabness of the afterlife’s police department is paired with the colorless paucity of the film’s heavies...The deados, unmemorable CG brutes, spout generic bad-guy dialogue undistinguished by humor or characterization."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,30,"The entire film has an oddly underdone quality to it, as if aiming not for greatness but to simply be passable."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,25,"Mostly loud and graceless, despite some arresting hyperbolic visuals that deserve an action film of actual soul and purpose. It's simply too generic at heart to justify director Schwentke's delirious, sidewinding, arcing, snap-zooming and whip-panning anti-gravity camerawork."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,25,A dud that squanders a decent cast and succeeds neither as the comedy nor the action film it purports to be.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"R.I.P.D. never creates a believable universe, interesting action sequences, or dynamic characters. It’s a paint-by-numbers approach in which the film’s comedy and drama both fall flat."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,It's nothing special. Which sort of makes it a loser all the way 'round. Expect a sad afterlife for it on cable.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,Tired byplay between Reynolds’s mystified straight man and Bridges’s supernatural old pro will kill off any fond memories you have of zesty buddy films past and present.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"What’s missing is what’s often absent in industrial moviemaking of this type: story and characters, yes, but also the human touch and a sense that someone behind the scenes actually cares about the work."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"Less a bad movie than simply not a movie, R.I.P.D. gives every indication of having been a sloppy first-draft script."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,"It so shamelessly borrows from so many other movies, and then does absolutely nothing to add to them -- nothing to raise the bar, nothing to make it more interesting, and really nothing to make it the least bit appealing."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,20,This is a second-rate special effects-dominated 3D entry that will join several prominent would-be blockbusters that need not be mentioned on the summer junk heap.
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,12,"For a movie that so strenuously rips off “Ghostbusters” and “Men in Black,” R.I.P.D. manages to come up with fresh new ways of being absolutely terrible."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,10,"The whole thing seems ill-conceived from the start, unable to keep its parameters simple – think of Ghostbusters and “Don’t cross the streams!” – but also lacking any genuine comic spark or imagination. It’s an exhausting 98 minute ride to nowhere."
R.I.P.D.,5.6,33618855,0,"This expensive misfire runs a little less than ninety minutes, which means that there’s likely a 105-110 minute long version that the producers hacked up in order to get the maximum amount of 3D showtimes to not embarrass the studio on opening weekend. Judging by the released product, that version is likely even worse, if such a thing were possible."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,100,Runaway Train is a reminder that the great adventures are great because they happen to people we care about.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,88,Runaway Train belongs to a rare genre: the intelligent thriller.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,80,"The true winning formula, however, is found in Voight and Roberts’ double-act. Their eccentric characters are funny, violent and heartwarming all at the same time, where we root for them despite the fact that they’re basically psychopaths."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,75,The action in this superlative film is relentless and gripping from beginning to end.
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,70,"Somehow one leaves aside the blatant implausibilities, the coincidences, even Eric Roberts, and takes great pleasure in a breakneck ride to the end of the line. And Voight has finally found his niche, abandoning all those wet-eyed liberal roles and playing to the hilt a hideous, raving beast, with scars. Great ending, too."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,63,"Although the film isn't an empty picture, it is too much of a good thing. Voight delivers a wonderful speech to Roberts about survival, but it's only one of many such monologues. Similarly, Roberts is tiring in his frantic reactions."
Runaway Train,7.3,7936012,63,"What is well worth watching here, much more so than the train itself, is Jon Voight, who gives a fiery performance in an unusually hard-edged role."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"A clever, vividly imagined, consistently funny, eye-poppingly pretty and oddly profound movie … about Legos."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"Everything in The Lego Movie is, indeed, awesome."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The LEGO Movie is the kind of animated free-for-all that comes around very rarely, if ever: A kids’ movie that matches shameless fun with razor-sharp wit, that offers up a spectacle of pure, freewheeling joy even as it tackles the thorniest of issues."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The movie is a wonderful surprise, cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The funniest, cleverest, most exhaustingly exhilarating animated feature in ages."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,The jokes fly at a pace demanding viewers to either refrain from laughing (highly unlikely) or see The Lego Movie again to catch all the wondrous sights and amiable wit sliding by the first time.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,It's hard to think of the last time a Pixar film made you go ''Wow!'' That's part of why The LEGO Movie is such outrageous and intoxicating fun.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,Finally! A comedy that works.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The Lego Movie is an absolute blast—a whip-smart, surprisingly emotional family film where the toy property is seen less as a concrete template than a tool for seemingly limitless potential."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"It’s a non-stop blast from beginning to end, jam-packed with a wacky irreverence, dazzling state-of-the-art CGI (courtesy of Animal Logic) and a pitch-perfect voice cast headed by Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,91,"Beautifully shot, impeccably paced, and with a voice cast that nails it in every role, large or small, ""The Lego Movie"" is a genuine delight."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,91,"Like the toy it's based on, it's goofy and colorful and something adults and children can enjoy together."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"Fast-paced, often hilarious fun and involves an imaginative and deeply weird use of cutting-edge digital animation."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"The Lego Movie is strikingly, exhilaratingly, exhaustingly fresh."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"The Lego Movie is a delight, a funny, fast-moving film that should satisfy adults and children alike."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,90,"Lord and Miller do great work within constraints, taking pre-made pieces and fashioning them into feats worthy of applause. It's no wonder they made a Lego movie — and it's no wonder it's so good."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,This is truly a movie that children and their parents can both enjoy for different reasons.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"A wickedly smart and funny free-for-all, and sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,A marvelous piece of work.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"There are so many things to like about The Lego Movie: a great voice cast, clever dialogue and a handsome blend of stop-motion and CGI animation that feels lovingly retro, while still looking sharp in 21st-century 3-D. But the best thing about this movie... is its subversive nature."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,The first great cinematic experience of 2014.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the storyline is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it’s hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,83,"Just plain funny, loaded with joke after joke and pun after pun."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,83,"Effervescent in style, conveying a substantive message without ever devolving into saccharine preachiness."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,An unexpected joy.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"The Lego Movie maybe be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work — a cash grab with a heart. Made for, with and about Legos, the movie is also made for, with and about imagination, and when that association seems completely natural, it's a win all around."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"For a film that clearly required a small army to make, it often feels thrillingly off-the-cuff, which keeps with The Lego Movie’s themes of creativity and weirdness: Nobody’s following an instruction book with this one."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"The LEGO Movie is sheer joy: the script is witty, the satire surprisingly pointed and the animation tactile and imaginative."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"Ridiculously funny and meticulously detailed, The LEGO Movie is far better than a toy tie-in movie has any right to be. Despite a couple of dips, you’ll be grinning throughout."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,The Lego Movie is bursting out of its box with enthusiasm and excitement for the possibilities of a little pile of nubby plastic.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"For a shot of pure forward-leaping, backward-dreaming animated pleasure, pick brick."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"Phil Lord and Christopher Miller irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,78,The film is one big advertisement for the multicolored building blocks from which it’s made. The Lego Movie may be the shrewdest marketing ploy you’ve ever seen.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,"No doubt, there is an uncomfortable number of logos being marketed to kids in the The Lego Movie, along with the obvious one that’s in the title, but the film as a whole is very much in the spirit of Cloud Cuckooland: It’s a place where the use of X-Acto blades and Krazy Glue breaks the rules but almost everything else goes."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,"The all-Lego adventure is warm and witty, showing flashes of satire."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,A manic and at times surprising comedy that has more imagination and creativity than all the Transformers pictures combined.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,The Lego Movie amuses and never fails to leave the viewer –especially adults — a little dazzled at the demented audacity of it all.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,63,"All told, there's an ageless warmth to The LEGO Movie akin to that of the LEGO brand itself."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,The Lego Film has a specialness all its own. There's never been a hodgepodge quite like it.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"As full-length toy advertisements go, you really couldn’t ask for more."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"The visual environment created by the filmmakers (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of “21 Jump Street” wrote and directed; the animation is by Animal Logic) hums with wit and imagination... The story is a busy, slapdash contraption designed above all to satisfy the imperatives of big-budget family entertainment."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,50,"As cute and energetic as it is, The Lego Movie is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long. The action scenes are enthusiastic, colorful but uninvolving, like an 8-year-old emptying a bucket of plastic blocks."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,"There are elements in the movie that make it worth seeing, and that set it aside from the routine movies in this genre."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,What this sequel delivers is still the kind of high-speed roller-coaster action that producer Joel Silver's films often do so well.
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,"Lethal Weapon 3 is all about chases and comedy schtick, and in this case the sum of the parts really adds up to more than the whole."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,75,"If you like fast food movies that you digest and then 10 minutes later forget what you had - or if a simple evening’s entertainment is what you’re after, this will certainly do the trick."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,70,"Lethal Weapon 3 picks up where Lethal Weapon 2 left off, with the same gags and tough-guy dialogue but things are starting to wear a bit thin."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,70,Lethal Weapon 3 isn't that much worse than the two earlier films.
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,63,"The movie zips around without any true forward momentum. The stars carry you along, though."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,60,The third film has way too many moments that push too far toward the absurd.
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,60,"More of the same, but it's now so far removed from any sense of reality, and done with such ham-fisted insistence, it's become a clumsy parody of itself."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,60,"A wham-bam encounter, it gives you everything you (presumably) want, sets itself up for another sequel, and it makes sure you don't recall a thing about it in the morning."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,58,"It's bigger, but it ain't necessarily better."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,58,"More of the same, though a lot coarser than its immediate predecessor, and the characters and situations have now calcified to the point where they're simply sitcom staples."
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,50,"Lethal Weapon 3 is pretty much the same as ""Lethal Weapon 2,"" which was pretty much the same as ""Lethal Weapon."""
Lethal Weapon 3,6.7,144731527,50,"Lethal Weapon 3 offers mediocrity wielded by experts. It's not a movie, it's a machine."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,67,"Really, the whole series would be unthinkable without the films of George Romero. In that respect, Anderson has taken another page from the Corman playbook for his superior B-movie: If you're going to steal, at least steal well."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,60,"Shot in actual 3D rather than being the latest example of the horrible post-shooting conversion process, ""Afterlife"" undeniably looks terrific."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,60,"If you're interested in this movie, it's because you love either seeing zombies explode (check), the video games (major character included, check) or Jovovich kicking undead butt in every conceivable way (check and mate)."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,60,Anderson makes often-inspiring use of the 3-D effects.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,50,"True to series form, plot is nearly indiscernible, but this fourth installment in the sci-fi/horror/action franchise created by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson is the sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,40,Jovovich is on cruise control here and she fails to bring any kind of new life to a character that has been very good to her.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,40,"What fun there is to be had is undermined by drab 3D, hacked-out dialogue and rehashed plots."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,35,"Sorry to disappoint the fanboys, but this is the first film in the Resident Evil series in which Milla Jovovich neither begins nor ends the movie stark naked."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,30,"It pains me to say it, but Afterlife, the latest installment in this seemingly eternal zombie apocalypse franchise, is considerably more entertaining than George A. Romero's most recent exhumation."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,30,"This witless installment features the usual ultra-slow-motion mayhem and helpful freeze-frames to allow us to admire the extra dimension. Fans will not be happy, however, to learn that Ms. Jovovich is more decently clothed this time around."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,30,Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who also directed the original) can hardly manage a hint of suspense or excitement. And excitement is exactly what the film ought to have in excess.
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,25,"It's a humorless movie of morphing zombies (they take on beastly attributes), phoned-in performances and trite dialogue."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,25,"Afterlife is slow-moving but relentless, and judging from a post-credits teaser that promises yet another sequel, it has an unquenchable appetite for your brain cells."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5.9,60128566,25,"So nonchalant is Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth movie in Paul W.S. Anderson's dystopian franchise, that its overarching premise isn't explained."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,50,"There's a fun retro camp to Hercules, with nods to classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as Hercules finds himself rowing slave ships and crossing desert expanses."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,The action comes thick and fast but the storyline is generic and Lutz makes a particularly dull hero. An Erymanthian bore.
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,"Renny Harlin's Legend of Hercules fulfills every silly, flimsy promise that it makes in the first place: There are lots of battles (albeit rather jerkily rendered ones), some grand-looking horses decked out in handsome metal headdresses, and lots of well-oiled beefcake."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,"This movie, with its relatively modest running time and not-quite-household-name cast, is no more ridiculous than, let’s say, the “Thor” movies, and a lot less pretentious."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,40,"Like so many of today’s action films, The Legend of Hercules is too busy peddling slick, stone-faced portent to ever bother making us laugh, or engaging us in any way."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,39,"While the art of action filmmaking depreciates, Harlin remains steadfast in his classicism, even if the movie doesn’t have the foundation to support him."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,38,"While Lutz might possess the beefcake to fill out his chest armor, he lacks the acting chops to make us much care about the fate of his gleaming hero who looks as if he just stepped out of a Beverly Hills salon."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,38,"Given its virtuous subject matter and the relative bloodlessness of its violence, perhaps Renny Harlin means for this film to be a means of atoning for his previous cinematic sins."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,38,"At times, with its stiff, charisma-impaired cast, its digital sets and slo-mo slaughter, The Legend of Hercules has a whiff of the Augean Stables about it — if you catch my drift."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,30,"Lutz’s acting muscles aren’t nearly as well developed as his pectorals and deltoids, and while the role may not call for a master thespian, it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like he’s straining to execute a dead lift."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,25,"While The Legend Of Hercules offers plenty for viewers who’ve acquired a taste for the fake and incompetent (not the least of which is the dialogue, which finds characters saying each other’s names at the end of every other sentence), it’s unlikely to please anyone who wants entertainment in the conventional sense."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"While watching it, I kept thinking this was like ""47 Ronin,"" in which an unfortunate novice director was given a project way out of his or her reach. In no way was I prepared to learn it was the work of veteran Harlin."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"If you admire Kellan Lutz's chiseled body, The Legend of Hercules does offer plenty of that in 3-D glory."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"Where 300 made a virtue of its low budget by stripping the visuals down to their essential elements, the shot-in-Bulgaria Legend Of Hercules mostly just looks rushed and cheap, only coming to life in a handful of fight scenes, and then only briefly."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,20,"If The Legend of Hercules were just a little more inept or over-the-top, it might have been ridiculous fun. As it is, unfortunately, Harlin embraces the mediocrity of the screenplay with a dour straight face, draining it of any enjoyably camp possibilities."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,16,A movie so ugly and woeful that you'll wish you had superhuman strength to pluck your own eyeballs out of your head.
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,12,The only thing epic about The Legend of Hercules is what a failure it is.
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,10,"The whole thing is a total bore; even the supporting players aren’t motivated enough to attract attention. That’s good news for Lutz; he can’t be blamed for torpedoing the project, because everyone is doing subpar work here."
The Legend of Hercules,4.2,18848538,0,"This ludicrously written, buffoonishly acted, irritatingly filmed sword-and-sandals epic hasn't half the sand, sweat or saltiness of other titles in the genre."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,83,Director Zack Snyder (300) has crafted the rare 3-D eyegasm that's worth the premium ticket price.
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,75,"The film is surprisingly deft and entertains at both the adult and juvenile levels. If something in Guardians catches your eye, trust your gizzard."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,75,"A splendid adventure sure to thrill children and fantasy buffs, while leaving everyone else passably entertained."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,70,"This picture sometimes rivals ""Avatar"" in its spectacular landscapes and thrilling flying sequences, but of course it won't come anywhere near those megagrosses, and it's too scary to be wholeheartedly embraced by children."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,70,"There's a confusion that you can sense as well, with the film pulled between its light and dark sides just as the owls struggle with forces of good and evil. That hesitation keeps ""Guardians"" from reaching the deep, emotionally rich center that confers greatness in the animation world."

Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,60,"Issues of faith, courage, loyalty, sacrifice and betrayal (the last perpetrated by Soren's brother) are all tackled by Snyder with understated maturity, though a series of slightly repetitive aerial skirmishes can't quite match the inventiveness of Feet's buoyant song-and-dance mash-ups."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,60,"Directorially, the film takes a few too many trips into prosaic slow motion."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,60,"The script is merely serviceable and too reminiscent of similar fantasy tales. But kids will instantly relate to the gentle Soren, while watching wide-eyed as he faces each challenge."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,60,"This is unlikely to win Kathryn Lansky's antipodean owl fantasy any new fans, but even the bemused (and confused) can luxuriate in some grand-scale visual storytelling."

Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,50,"Legend of the Guardians may be a hoot, but for all its pyrotechnics, it fails to soar."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,50,"Legend of the Guardians sounds as if it were scripted by a team of 11-year-old boys, with too much plot for its 91-minute running time, a script that steals liberally from ""Star Wars"" and some occasionally eye-roll-worthy weirdness."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,50,"Though visually stunning and blessed with immaculate 3D work, film is fatally bogged down by tackling an essentially ridiculous premise (gladiator-attired owls fight genocide) with stony solemnity, and by subsisting on a note of sustained menace and terror in what is ostensibly a children's film."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,40,"The sketchy visual traits that differentiate the many characters in this avian universe will leave viewers crying, ""Who, who"" along with the owls."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,40,Zack Snyder's films have some of the best opening-credits sequences in cinema; the unfortunate thing is that there's always a movie after them.
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,38,"And the action? It's especially hard to determine who's fighting whom in ""Legends,"" because, well, because they are a bunch of owls."
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,7.0,55675313,38,"The movie is still a mess, stumbling from comic-relief scenes that aren't funny to a job-training interlude in which we learn that, among other things, owls make excellent . . . blacksmiths?"

Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,75,"The laughs, including the big laughs, keep coming right up to the closing seconds."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,63,"It's breezy stuff, to be sure. And while English is far from becoming the Pink Panther for the Facebook generation, Atkinson has a breezy rapport with junior Agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) that's reminiscent of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau and his relationship with sidekick Kato."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,The mix of groin injury and over-explanation could totally reach 9-year-olds and a greying Atkinson is still relentlessly lovable.
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,"As the movie glides along, it may not elicit explosive laughter, but it plants a steady smile on your face and doesn't leave you feeling molested. If that's another way of saying Johnny English Reborn is old-fashioned, so be it."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,60,"All that matters with efforts like this is whether the cookie-cutter plotting serves up enough situations for Atkinson to contort himself into and out of jams. After all, are the narratives what you remember from the ""Pink Panther"" movies? Or the silly things, like that Clouseau could so easily get his finger caught in a spinning globe?"

Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"For anyone expecting the second coming of Clouseau, Johnny English Reborn is a karmic catastrophe."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"I spent most of Johnny English wondering whom the filmmakers were targeting. While childish and silly, it's far too violent for young kids."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"After a fast, funny start, the new sequel, Johnny English Reborn, proves to be more of the same."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,38,"As ticklish as one might find the idea of an equivalent Mr. Bean character occupying the driver's seat of a James Bond parody, it's likely that even a competent manifestation of such a scenario would pale in comparison to what Mike Myers and Jay Roach pulled off with apparent ease in their Austin Powers films."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,30,"Atkinson's fans are likely to rejoice as the comedian twists his face and body to and fro, but the rest of us will not be recruited."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,20,"An incredible physical comedian, Rowan Atkinson would seemingly do anything for a laugh except one crucial thing: hold out for a better script. This sequel to 2003's Johnny English has a few inspired gags, but most of the material is on the level of English getting kicked repeatedly in his thunderballs."
Johnny English Reborn,6.3,8305970,20,"It must be said that everyone - including Dominic West and Rosamund Pike -- works awfully hard to entertain us. But that just makes it all the more depressing when joke after joke falls painfully flat. Stay home and introduce your kids to Mr. Bean, instead."
Road House,6.6,30050028,80,"An immensely enjoyable slice of romanticised fisticuffs, this is a Western in every respect except the stetsons and six guns."
Road House,6.6,30050028,80,"Swayze gives up 'Dirty Dancing' for dirty fighting in this violent, spectacular and immensely enjoyable study of Zen and the art of Barroom Bouncing...Mindless entertainment of the highest order."
Road House,6.6,30050028,63,"Road House exists right on the edge between the ""good-bad movie"" and the merely bad. I hesitate to recommend it, because so much depends on the ironic vision of the viewer. This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either."
Road House,6.6,30050028,50,Road House is startling because of the intensity of its violence and because of Swayze`s mindless posturing. A young star has sold himself to become a pinup boy.
Road House,6.6,30050028,50,The film gets campier by the minute.
Road House,6.6,30050028,40,"Director Rowdy Herrington lives up to his name: once he's seen to it that all the conventions of the western are in place, he presents an all-out brawl on the average of about every 12 minutes or so, and the battles quickly grow tiresome. Swayze is up to a part that requires him merely to show his muscles and dexterity, but Gazzara is trapped in his hopelessly evil caricature, leaving Sam Elliott (in a too-limited role) to provide the film's only real charm."
Road House,6.6,30050028,40,"With Road House, United Artists hotwires Patrick Swayze a star vehicle shackled by a couple of flat tires in the script department. Ill-conceived and unevenly executed, pic essentially is a Western - a loner comes in to clean up a bar, of all things, and ends up washing and drying the whole town - but its vigilante justice, lawlessness and wanton violence feel ludicrous in a modern setting."
Road House,6.6,30050028,38,"An ugly commingling of old Westerns, Zen chic and kung fu movies...Full of gratuitous mayhem, head-bashing, gay-bashing and woman-bashing, Road House has a malicious, almost putrid tone."
Road House,6.6,30050028,38,"In Road House, Patrick Swayze has the most laughable role since Tom Cruise juggled a few liquor bottles and danced to ''The Hippy Hippy Shakes'' in Cocktail...Next to Dalton, Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing seems like Hamlet. Mr. Swayze does some dirty fighting here, but mostly the role requires a blank expression. At this point, Road House makes his career look like a bad joke."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,100,"Far from lazy, it is a fairly brilliant sendup of comic-book action movies, as well as also being an excellent example of one."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,92,"The film ends on a remarkably touching emotional note. Had it held to the strength of its convictions—and it is immensely obvious why it did not—it might have been the best ending of any superhero movie to date. (No, the bar’s not terribly high.) But it’s nonetheless awfully good, and we can still look forward to, mid-credits, the world’s best-ever Green Lantern joke."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,90,A superhero movie so tightly made and brilliantly entertaining that even Deadpool himself would have trouble finding fault with it.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,88,"Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements, terrific ensemble work — and for dessert, perhaps the best end-credits “cookie” scene ever."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,88,Deadpool 2 throws everything it has at you until you throw your arms up in happy surrender.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,83,"Is Deadpool 2 obnoxious? Is it needlessly self-aware? Is it drunk on its own fairly tame naughtiness? Is it so stuffed full of unrelated pop culture references that it sort of feels like a meme shirt come to life? The answer to all those questions is a resounding yes, but it’s also, weirdly, refreshing."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,83,"Deadpool 2, while extremely thin on plot, is gleefully impish, entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny. Almost everything that felt forced, crass and hamfisted in the original film now feels organic and effortless; a constant breezy stream of gags, quips and expertly choreographed action. Deadpool 2 is filthier, funnier and ferociously manic."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,81,"The result isn't as novel as the original, or as effortlessly kinetic, but it is nevertheless a joke-packed action film that continues to deliver on the character's potential, while opening up the door to an even bigger series of sarcastic superhero adventures."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Infinity War will likely be first choice for the summer season crowd, but Deadpool 2 wins hands down in terms of personal stakes and visual flair."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"This is the rare comedy sequel that doesn’t just equal the original: it betters it, with bells and ball-sacks on."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Right now, he's the perfect ""Avengers"" antidote."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. (And yes, you must stay for the post-credit scenes.) Sometimes it maybe doesn’t take itself seriously enough (after about the 50th crack you do kind of want to tell Reynolds to hold off for a minute). But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Funnier, filthier, and damn entertaining, Deadpool 2 leaves no stone un-deconstructed: the naughty man-child of the X-Men universe who manages to beat them at their own game."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it as many overcooked comic-book sequels do. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,78,"Despite the character’s trademark flippancy, there’s a real unexpected warmth to Deadpool 2. Not only does the sequel explore this flawed character, it firmly establishes him as a loveable and effective hero."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"The film’s greatest asset is Reynolds, who in Deadpool finally found the role of his dreams. Reynolds totally sells the character’s blend of reckless self-absorption and reluctant heroics."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Here, Leitch uses brevity to do for witty action what it famously does for wit alone."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"The bottom line is that viewers who enjoyed Deadpool will almost certainly enjoy Deadpool 2, although perhaps not quite as much."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"After shooting lots of people and cutting lots of throats, Deadpool tries blowing himself up, something he probably should have done first. And with that, the movie shifts. Deadpool 2 becomes less violent and a lot funnier. It becomes a much better movie than the original “Deadpool,” not an action bloodbath with laughs, but a knowing spoof of the superhero genre."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"If you’ve got comics-movie fatigue, with frequent fourth-wall breaks to point out lazy writing, blatant foreshadowing or heavy reliance on CGI for fight scenes, Deadpool 2 is here for you. That doesn’t mean those things aren’t there (they are) — but the eagerness of Deadpool to call out its own shortcomings earns this trash-talking franchise a lot of goodwill."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 is chock-full of all the cartoonish ultraviolence, meta commentary and pop-culture references you’d expect. Where it surprises — and why it works so well — is how it balances an actually touching undercurrent alongside superhero subversiveness."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Reynolds is once again at his arch and nihilist best here, while acting and jumping in so much facial prosthetics that it makes him look like he’s inside melted cheese — or, as the first movie put it, an avocado that had relations with an older avocado."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"It’s in Deadpool’s DNA to channel the wild id of a 12-year-old boy — a very clever one who happens to love boobs, Enya, and blowing stuff up. Which is dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 is just like “Deadpool” only more so. It’s actually a fair bit better — funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Like so many franchise-starting first films, “Deadpool” had to push through some necessary evils to get to the good stuff, fortunately, all that subversive goodness is on wild display in Deadpool 2, which delivers on the promise of the first film (and more)."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,Does Deadpool 2 pick up its predecessor’s baton and run off to new and exciting places? Not really. Is it as tasty as leftovers on the second day? Absolutely. Temper your expectations accordingly.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 gets by as simply on a par with “Deadpool,” an ultra-violent joked-up Energizer Bunny of a comic book movie with a fun supporting cast, dead-pan deaths and deadpan Deadpool jokes about those deaths."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,71,"Deadpool 2 is at its best when it cheerfully doesn’t give a shit. The more it cared, the less I did."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,70,"Deadpool 2 is an overstuffed cinematic burrito of raunchy insults, dismembering violence and a ""no f#*ks given"" attitude that's ready to burst at any second, but somehow holds together bite after enjoyable bite."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,70,"In almost every respect, this sequel is an improvement on its 2016 predecessor: Sharper, grosser, more narratively coherent and funnier overall, with a few welcome new additions. It’s a film willing to throw everything — jokes, references, heads, blood, guts and even a little bit of vomit — against the wall, rarely concerned about how much of it sticks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,It all boils down to one important fact: Reynolds gets these comics.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,"It still works. Maybe not as well, since the element of shock and awe can’t be put back into its bottle, but anyone who enjoyed Wilson’s transformation into a bullet-hole-riddled leotard that can’t shut up should have as much fun."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,"Though bringing in a bona fide action-cheese aesthete like David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, John Wick) to direct counts as a minor coup, Deadpool 2’s attempts to fight superhero fatigue with self-awareness and meta shock value can become exhausting. Indulgent and uneven, but in spots gruesomely funny, the new film badly lacks the basic momentum of the original’s formulaic plot."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,"Deadpool 2 is very good at what it does, which is flattering the audience into feeling like it’s in on the joke. If you’re a doubter, though, you may wonder if the joke’s on us."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,"Since Deadpool 2 shows no sign of wanting to rewrite a whole genre with its audacity, we might as well concede that it does the job it apparently wants to do with professionalism and flair, and that the faster we end this piece, the faster you can go on social media and complain about it."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,The original “Deadpool” caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel sparks only intermittently.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"The fight sequences aren’t as good as director David Leitch’s previous work like Atomic Blonde and the John Wick movies, but it’s better than the standard superhero fare, with enough clever touches to keep things interesting."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"There is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"Perhaps it’s the effort of introducing so many new characters that has sucked out the spontaneity from Deadpool: still, it’s nothing that can’t be sorted for the likely next installments."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,The movie’s other major weakness is its continued foregrounding of the white guys at the expense of the consciously inclusive cast around them.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"With its uncompromising commitment to gross-out injuries, nerdy pop culture in-jokes and inappropriate touching, Deadpool 2 was clearly made to cater to existing fans with every innuendo-filled moment (they should stay through the credits for some important story points that are very nearly thrown away)."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,58,"Deadpool 2 likes to situate itself as the subversive alternative to so many bloated X-Men films, with all their grave self-importance and bombastic action, but even more of this go-around resembles those movies than its predecessor, and if it reads to you as more than a bit hypocritical, just know you’re hardly alone."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"In Deadpool 2, the manic antics fly fast, but the franchise loses its edge as wise-cracking antihero Deadpool goes dadcore, attempting to infuse standard-issue four-quadrant studio blockbuster beats into what was once a revolutionary R-rated premise."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,Deadpool 2 muddies the distinction between parodying comic-book-movie conventions and perfunctorily adhering to them.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"Never before have the demands of my inner man-child been so stirred, though, than while experiencing Deadpool 2, a movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"Not too far beneath the movie’s superficial abrasiveness is a desperate desire to be loved, a puppyish determination that is both hard to resist and, eventually, difficult to endure."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"There’s no other way to put this: Deadpool 2 is a regular, shmegular superhero movie, distinguished only by an obnoxiously unearned dose of “see what I did there?!” It’s a drag."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"It’s a long movie and when its star isn’t on screen and cracking wise, the boundary-pushing shocks and endless self-references wear thin. Still, if you’re the Deadpool fanatic who recently had Reynolds’s name tattooed on his arse, you definitely won’t be grumbling."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"We’ve reached superhero saturation point, and Deadpool 2 is less a satire of that condition than a symptom of it. It has zero suspense — it’s too hip, too meta, for suspense."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,30,"It’s overstuffed, and essentially empty."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,100,"The Avengers latest stand feels well worth the wait. It’s not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn’t dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you’ve come to demand from an MCU movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,100,"Marvel has solved their third-act problem and villain problem and then some. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. But then, neither are our heroes."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,93,"Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. It’s what happens when moviemakers take their source material seriously, eschewing unnecessary melodrama even as they fully embrace the grandeur, the sheer spectacle, of it all."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,91,"After years of movies where even the most mediocre heroes appeared to be invulnerable and indomitable, it’s an arresting jolt — and exactly the film the franchise needed."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,90,"The film boasts plenty of comic-book action while also making room for a darker tone and emotional resonance rarely matched in previous installments. In a cinematic world stuffed with big-budget movies, Infinity War is a genuine blockbuster."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,90,"Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,89,"Never has the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War—the title is almost too apt—is a narrative juggling act the likes of which I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before. It is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,89,"The Marvel films have been accused of being repetitive in their structure; Infinity War bursts any conventions wide apart. This is a vast, truly epic endeavor, one that both brings the current MCU to a near-climax (wait for the so-far-untitled follow-up, due May 2019, for the ultimate resolution), and sets the future in motion."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"No, it’s not a game-changer like ""Deadpool"" or ""Logan."" It remains firmly anchored within the “traditional” comic book milieu. But, with an unwavering devotion to spectacle and action, the film throws down a gauntlet where this kind of mass team-up is concerned."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"Infinity War might be the biggest and most ambitious Marvel movie yet, but it’s certainly not the best. (I’d put it somewhere in the bottom half of the Top 10.) However, there’s plenty of action, humor and heart — and some genuinely effective dramatic moments in which familiar and beloved characters experience real, seemingly irreversible losses."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"It could have been an unholy mess, but with directors Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm, Infinity War is instead a glorious, multilayered and clever comic-book adventure with loads of emotional stakes and a perfect foe for Earth’s mightiest heroes."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,83,"Ultimately, the latest Marvel event is ‘Civil War’ on steroids and as enormous a spectacle as you’ll ever see on the screen that’ll leave you shook. For a movie plot this thin and basic, ‘Infinity War,’ is remarkably gripping, supersized entertainment that should exhilarate audiences, electrify the box office and continue the Marvel hegemony for years to come."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"With so many ingredients to stir into this overflowing pot, you have to hand it to the two experienced teams of Marvel collaborators who had a feel for how to pull this magnum opus off."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,It’s a sleekly witty action opera that’s at once overstuffed and bedazzling.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"A comic-book flick that’s as thrilling and enthralling as it is pretentious and preposterous. The story is just an excuse for the action sequences, and the Marvel strategy remains intact: When in doubt, blow stuff up."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"It’s exhausting, but it’s also frequently effective. It’s surface-level with its emotional beats, but a number of them still land, largely thanks to the continuously all-in performances of the series’ endlessly patient stars. It’s an event that advertises itself as an event in every way, while somehow still managing to justify the immense hype around it."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"It’s filled with moments that click, but it just feels too big."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,All the past decade’s Marvel movies have been heading toward this showdown. Turns out the payoff was worth the wait.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"There are moments of high drama in Infinity War—between father and daughter, brother and brother, mentor and protégé, lover and lover—that these actors, as deep in this series as we are, deliver on with teary intensity. And there’s a haunting final sequence that is as grave and, I daresay, almost poetic as anything the film series has done."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"Infinity War is big, blustery and brave, taking viewers to places that they may not be used to going."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,What saves Infinity War from being just another bloated supergroup tour – and what will end up being the thing that blows fans’ minds to dust – is the film’s final stretch.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"As a virtuoso juggling act, Infinity War has no real parallel in popular culture; as a movie, it’s an impressive montage of greatest hits until the gut punch of a finale."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes ... at least not yet."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"So, for basically 90 percent of this movie, I’m sitting there thinking, Okay, this is awesome. Then things changed slightly. And I need to be clear: not to the point it changes how I feel about the movie. I still enjoyed it immensely. But Infinity War did send me out on an unfulfilled note, which, to be fair, is probably by design"
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Flagrantly, bombastically extravagant, it plays its audience like a hundred million fiddles."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Whatever else it may be — a culmination, an obligation, a staggering feat of crowd control, a truly epic tease — Avengers: Infinity War is a brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,The Russos and the hundreds of craftspeople who worked on this film have dreamed up marvelous battles — especially the one where a motley assortment of heroes take their cracks at the purportedly unstoppable Thanos. But only once here did an intergalactic vista catch my breath the way a splash page in a Silver Surfer comic might.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Infinity War boasts the most breathtaking, audacious moment in superhero movie history, one that rocketed through my brain and tore apart everything I thought I knew about the past 10 years of Marvel moviemaking. For the first time in a while, I can’t wait to see what happens next."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being ""Part 1"" and holding enough development for ""Part 2,"" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Directors Joe and Anthony Russo move their many playing pieces around with as much grace as possible, and they offer up jolts of pleasure throughout."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,67,"Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,67,"This story may be on its last legs, but as table-setting for an even bigger threat, Infinity War daringly leaves more questions in the air. The way this world ends looks to be not with a bang, but a whimper."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"Picking up where Joss Whedon, director of the first two “Avengers” films, left off, sibling filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo have so many pairings and sparrings to work through that the movie is essentially a mixed martial arts extravaganza with a severely overcrowded undercard."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"Characters overflow on the screen, crowding out emotional investment, and there is a severely misplaced emphasis on the power of special effects — many characters appear to be entirely digitized, and none has much screen impact."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"This movie shouldn't just engage and amuse and occasionally move us; it should shock and scar us. It should kill Ned Stark and Optimus Prime and Bambi's mommy, then look us in the eye after each fresh wound and say, ""Sorry, love. These things happen."""
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,It’s really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes “Infinity War” — an “Ocean’s Eleven” in hyper drive — work.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"Organisationally, the movie has a struggle on its hands not to seem like the contents of a toy chest simply chucked down the stairs, with all the chaos of limbs and accessories that implies."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"Thanos is the most interesting, and most complex, character here."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"It’s hard to give sibling co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (makers of the thornier Captain America films) any credit—or blame, really—for steering a product that’s been so corporately fine-tuned. They toggle dutifully between million-dollar quips and Wrestlemania smackdowns, and when they find room for a vista of galactic stillness, it’s not out of any inspired vision so much as the need for air."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"I appreciate the sheer logistical achievement of Infinity War (and the chutzpah of its ending). I laughed a bunch of times, and some of the scenes are definitely exciting. But I would be lying if I pretended this movie ever grabbed me the way the best MCU movies did."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,58,"Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"The plot consists of bits: a fiery slugfest, a pause for bonding, a quick weep, and a patch of jokey repartee, before the slugging returns. Acts of sacrifice are dotted throughout, and we are urged to applaud the burgeoning fellowship of those who unite against Thanos, but, in truth, it’s every man for himself."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"As for everything that happens this time around, it’s a function — or malfunction — of the sequel’s two-part structure. The problem is penultimateness, too much setup and too little payoff. The solution comes, presumably, around the same time next year."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Over the last few years, the Avengers, together and separately, have spawned a number of good, very good, or reasonably entertaining movies. But with Avengers: Infinity War, the Marvel Comics franchise arrives at the stage of decadence. There’s just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"The film has its momentary diversions, a few good throwaway jokes amid a tremendous amount of PG-13 maiming and destruction."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Ordinary rules of drama don’t apply in the Marvel Universe, so expecting Avengers: Infinity War to build suspense, reach a climax and deliver some sort of conclusion is just…unreasonable."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act, including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond, as it were) brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,Infinity War is all manic monotony. It's passably numbing in the moment. And despite the hard-luck finish—something an obligatory post-credits sequence goes a long way toward neutering—it's instantly forgettable.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,40,Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,40,"There’s no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It’s all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,38,"Even by Marvel’s own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,75,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected. Ms. Swanson's funny, deadpan delivery holds the story together reasonably well, as does the state-of-the-art Val-speak that constitutes most of Buffy's dialogue."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,67,"Buffy is amusing for a time but its destiny is to die in a disappointing, long-winded conclusion. The second half feels stretched out and muddled, as if screenwriter Joss Whedon drove a stake through his script. However, in his depiction of the vapid SoCal world, Whedon knows the territory."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"The movie is a mess from start to finish. But then again, this jerky, haphazard approach is part of the movie's goofy charm."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"This spoof vampire flick's sole joke is that the heroine (Kristy Swanson) is a blonde, L.A. airhead rather than a beefed-up stake-toter, mentored by Donald Sutherland's deadpan Watcher."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a fun movie; so much better than it has to be and so much better than you expect it to be. Buffy is to vampire movies what Valley Girl is to Romeo and Juliet stories: a fresh reworking of an old formula staged by up-to-the-second California teens.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"The direction of Fran Rubel Kuzui (Tokyo Pop) suggests that she's more comfortable with character than action, and Joss Whedon's script has some fun with Valley talk (both genuine and ersatz) but strains to sell the story."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,60,"If you've seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer's poster, you've seen the movie. Otherwise, this pallid crossbreeding of vampire horror with Valley Girl vamping has no surprises."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,50,"Buffy isn't heinous, just disposable. As a friend tells Buffy while she eyes a fashion purchase, ""It's so five minutes ago."""
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,5.6,16624456,50,Director Fran Rubel Kuzui's frenzied mistrust of her material is almost total. Somebody should have given her a garlic necklace -- or a Miltown -- and told her to chill out.
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,70,Jake Speed is fun - a deliberately mindless adventure that keeps tongue firmly in cheek.
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,60,"It has a lively start and finish, but the middle could use less talk and more action--which is not to say it couldn't do with a much lower body count as well. Indeed, were it not for a big dollop of gratuitous violence, it would be more diverting and better crafted than most of the stuff filling up the screen in anticipation of the rest of the summer blockbusters."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,50,"Although the film fails at a number of levels, most acutely in never making us care much about any of the characters or their problems, it possesses a loopy charm that makes it a pleasure to watch."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,50,"Most of the possibilities for humor or tension, either sexual or dramatic, are badly botched by the flat performances of the other lead actors and the consistent bad timing of the director - everything misfires or misconnects, leaving too many long, dead moments that prove that even an adventure film with lots of running and shooting can be boring."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,50,"Crawford plays Speed with his foot in his mouth rather than tongue-in-cheek, and instead of glorying in the experiences of the pulp novel dialogue, dissipates all the comic potential by his evident bewilderment."
Jake Speed,5.3,1943751,40,Jake Speed isn't a movie. It's just a financial deal.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,95,"Dredd works because it's an action flick with wide appeal that takes risks it doesn't need to - in its delightfully off-putting violence and daring style - and those choices pay off in a singular and exhilarating movie experience. It's savage, beautiful and loads of fun."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,83,"Paul Leonard-Morgan's thumping techno soundtrack is thrilling. And Urban manages to give a credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-Eastwood voice - and his chin."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"This is a film that aims squarely at respecting its source’s established fan base, and cares little for casualties who can’t hang on through its grindhouse paces."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"What's exceptional is the orchestration of color, form, light and dark (lots of dark), 3-D technology and digital effects into a look that amounts to a vision."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,Dredd is proudly degenerate - and it never feels compelled to slow down and explain itself.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"The impressively lean script by Alex Garland (28 Days Later) is shorn of almost all superfluity beyond a few dud Schwarzeneggeresque kiss-offs, while Anthony Dod Mantle's sensational widescreen cinematography harkens back to the tension-inducing inventiveness of early John Carpenter."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"In a world of compromised adaptations, Dredd is something of a triumph."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"Pitched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, Dredd 3D feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,78,"Absolutely, 100% kickass. Now would someone please get busy on the ""Tank Girl"" do-over, please?"
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"This, finally, is the Dredd movie comic book readers have been anticipating."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"The themes are also dated. There are times when Dredd 3D feels like an escapist companion piece to ""The Day After."" But there we go again, thinking too much. No sense in ruining such a fine piece of cheap entertainment."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"Fitfully uneven, Dredd is nevertheless an intriguing consolidation of action-movie excess -- and even makes a solid case for its aesthetic appreciation."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,The story places a premium on delivering its disreputable sex-and-violence goods with a minimum of fuss or pretension.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"If there's a serious disappointment, it's the villain. Ma-Ma, despite being played with over-the-top zest by Lena Headey, isn't a very impressive foil for the mighty Judge Dredd, even when she calls for ""back-up."""
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"Dredd 3-D places you firmly in an unreal, dreamlike world and rouses you with its unexpected grace and its rhythms and its movement. The plot ceases to matter after a certain point: This is a great big beautiful music video, and there's nothing really wrong with that."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"This breathless science-fiction thriller isn't just gory. It practically revels in graphic violence, with several scenes shot in excruciating slow motion."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"Grim, gritty and ultra-violent, Dredd reinstates the somber brutality missing from the U.K. comicbook icon's previous screen outing."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,67,"Dredd is a video game procedural tied to great visuals, but one without deeper substance to make its experience remotely meaningful."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,63,"For sci-fi action fans, it's an instant classic. For everyone else, it's a dark, bloody mess."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,The stylish sci-fi film makes some eye-popping and unexpected choices that add up to one heck of a fun film.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,"There was much to dread about this new iteration of Dredd, but it's a solid, occasionally excellent take on the character, with Urban's chin particularly impressive."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,"Grungy, compact and delightfully violent, Dredd wants to hit you as hard as it can. The sequel may be the movie you really want, but for now, justice has been done."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,50,"Dredd's cinematography is one of its strongest assets speaks to the film's larger problems - the parts and pieces just don't have the total impact they should, like a punch sailing helplessly through the air rather than forcefully smacking its target."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,50,"Pretty clearly determined to deliver the antidote to Stallone's movie, the filmmakers take their cues from Christopher Nolan's Batman filmscape, dropping Dredd into a fictional concrete sprawl (actually South Africa) that's relentlessly grounded, visually and dramatically. In a generic way, the environment works."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,42,"Olivia Thirlby adds some humanity as the empath. And as the scarred queen of a drug cartel, Lena Headey chews the scenery, and some of her costars, with relish."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,40,"Every so often there's a suggestion that a police state may actually be a lousy idea, but this thought dies even faster than the disposable characters."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,38,"Calling Dredd 3D a movie is sort of a lie. It's a premise, and there are levels to reach, and always there's another grimy hallway to stalk, and then you turn right or left, and then kill some more."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,33,"Dredd, a second attempt at making Judge Dredd a movie star, overcorrects, veering in the opposite direction with a dark - literally and otherwise - nearly humorless bit of ultraviolence distinguished largely by a fondness for spurting CGI blood."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,25,All I wanted to do was escape from this aggressively ugly world and its equally unattractive characters. It's not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyperviolence adds up to nothing: This thing is dedd.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,20,"The drug that Ma-Ma trafficks in, Slo-Mo, slows its user's brain to 1% of its normal speed. Dredd unfortunately makes you feel as if you, too, have partaken."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,100,"Mark Perez has written one of the tightest comedy scripts to make it to be the big screen in ages. Game Night, directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, wastes not a single second of dialogue, gives killer lines to every member of its all-star ensemble, delivers genuinely tense action sequences, and even goes for broke with style."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,92,"Fast and funny, filled with memorable characters, and able to balance slapstick and violence without spilling too far in either direction, this frenetic R-rated farce is that rare comic gem that lands on all the spaces without ever going to jail."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,90,"It takes real intelligence to make the best dumb jokes. Game Night has plenty of both, combining skilled filmmaking and ridiculous gags in equal measure, and letting the seriousness and silliness play off of each other for maximum effect."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,88,"Watching Game Night is like witnessing someone on a hot streak while playing charades. As they keep nailing points for their team in rapid succession, you wonder how long they can sustain it. In Game Night, it’s the laughs that just keep coming."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,88,This is one of the best surprises of a still-young movie year: a comedy that takes nothing seriously except fun.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,83,"McAdams, whose comedic skills have gone unsung for way too long, is dizzy fun. The whole movie is, actually, even if it pretty much evaporates on impact — a kooky, vicarious loop of Mad Libs meets Cards Against Humanity, where whoever’s holding the popcorn last wins."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,80,"With its clever, whip-smart script and enthusiastic ensemble cast firing on all cylinders, crime comedy filmmakers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein score big with Game Night."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"It maintains its cheekiness while poking fun at the overused concept of redemption. Most importantly, it stays funny up to the beginning of the end credits, and maybe a little beyond."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,A riotous dark comedy in which a cute suburban get-together becomes a lethal nightmare.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"The overall results are unusually wholesome – and satisfyingly funny. Game Night is the kind of harmless comedy you rarely see these days, as happily entertaining as a good game of Pictionary."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"Game Night is a winner, plain and simple. Brisk and engaging (and surprisingly powered by a score from Cliff Martinez that’s expectedly great), this is a comedy that’s worth rolling the dice on."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"It’s not a movie that will make you tired, but lack of ambition can sometimes be a strength. This is a comedy-thriller made simply to please in the moment, and it does, for almost every minute of its 100-minute running time."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"Game Night is not the greatest comedy in the world, but it has a great grasp of the ingredient that makes comedy work, identified centuries ago as brevity."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,Bateman's dazzling deadpan can raise tired zingers to raucous life with only a throwaway eyebrow lift. And McAdams takes to comedy with a natural actor's grace and precision. Talk about fun company. They're it.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"There are more than enough laughs and clever surprises in this broad and sometimes violent farce to warrant a recommendation, thanks to a solidly funny script by Mark Perez, some pretty neat camera moves and choreographed action/comedic sequences from directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein — and a likable and talented ensemble cast, led by two of my favorites."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"A charismatic ensemble cast, a sharp script and a few well-placed twists make Game Night one of the more enjoyable big studio comedies in recent memory."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"It’s essentially David Fincher’s The Game matched with the comic overtones of Horrible Bosses, which is why it winds up being an entertaining jaunt."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"At first, you may be inclined to reject it outright, but Game Night works so hard to win viewers over that it eventually finds its way to a winning formula."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,The back and forth between McAdams and Bateman is what makes Game Night sing.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"It won’t fix the studio comedy, but it’s a welcome, watchable outlier for now."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"It’s a good time, but it maybe could have been a great one. Which I suppose is true of so many nights meant to deliver us from the doldrums of settled life. I don’t think that meta-ness is a deliberate feature of Game Night. But with all the sharpness Daley and Goldstein show us here, I’m not ruling it out, either."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"It’s ridiculous, far-fetched — absurdist, even. Some, or even a lot, of the jokes are stupid. But thanks in part to a terrific cast, expert timing and an all-in aesthetic, it's really funny."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"A lot of the jokes are surprising, and one gag...pays off terrifically. The two top stars are delightful, and a couple of cameos are nice surprises."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"The movie manipulates its audience in cunning and puckish ways. It’s no big whoop, but you’re happy to have been played."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,67,"Game Night is one of those comedy tweeners in which the jokes that click are milked too long and jokes that don’t will take too long to confirm that. Appropriately for the premise, it’ll likely be more enjoyable at home with friends."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,67,"This tame but fitfully funny goof on suspense cinema at least assembles an agreeable guest list.... As with any real game night, the company is more important than the game."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,"Like a real-life game night, the comedy may not leave a lasting impression, but it’s plenty of fun while it lasts."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,"Game Night itself is not a long night; it’s reasonably snappy. But co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein place a misjudged emphasis on keeping the violence and the action “real,” so at its most routine and generic, the movie forgets it’s supposed to be a comedy."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,The film establishes coherent characters and drops them into a twisty mystery plot that’s tightly crafted enough to generate some real narrative momentum while never getting too bogged down in its own plot that it forgets to be funny.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,"Way too much of Game Night is given away in the trailer, the violence is a bit much and truth be told — the folding in on itself plot gets in its own way, especially in the third act. But Bateman makes the big bucks for being the best put-upon “hero” in comedy. And McAdams, doing an epic Amanda Plummer (“Pulp You Know What,” remember?) absolutely steals the picture."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,60,"The set-pieces are quick, light and for the most part fun. What Game Night lacks in (any) plausibility or coherence it makes up for in Friday night, pleasingly brainless entertainment."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,60,The Jason Bateman comedy model hasn’t quite been radically altered in Game Night but it’s one of his more entertaining outings. Just don’t count on remembering much of it once the night is over.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,55,It’s hard to say Game Night is entirely bad. I laughed a lot and its creators are clearly capable of crafting a joke. Yet they seem to have either an incomplete or an incredibly cynical conception of what a movie is.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"The movie relies rather too heavily on McAdams’ charm, sort of like a limp cheeseburger that’s saved by some really good bacon. But hey, sometimes a fast-food cheeseburger satisfies, more or less."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"The film owes what charm it has to a whip-smart script (heavy on double entendres – a delight for word nerds and game geeks alike), and the chemistry between its actors."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"For all the energy that Rachel McAdams, Jason Bateman, and their castmates pour into their gimmicky comedy, there’s too often a feeling that they’re straining to pump up flat material."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,The movie is a pointed reminder that Ms. McAdams is one of cinema’s most accomplished and appealing comic actresses. It’s almost heartbreaking to contemplate how amazing she would be in a new comedy that was more than intermittently O.K.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"There are chuckles here and there, but a striking absence of belly laughs; Girls Trip it’s decidedly not."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,40,"Bateman and McAdams have some fun with the gonzo goofiness of the project, and milk a couple of comedy set-pieces—like one about a gunshot wound and a squeaky toy—but the flatness of their characters leaves no room for relatability."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,40,"Certainly you expect a good time from Bateman and McAdams, who give their banter just the right sly, sportive rhythm even when the lines and situations themselves come up short."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,40,"The movie’s only vaguely human presence is Sharon Horgan (the gifted writer and star of TV’s Catastrophe), who gazes upon the manufactured gags with an air of chagrin. If the movie had risen even an inch to her level, Game Night might've had some game."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,80,"For his robust and handsome The Musketeer, Hyams enlisted veteran Hong Kong stunt coordinator Xin-Xin Xiong to stage a clutch of spectacular action sequences that are amusing in the imaginative intricacy of their bravura."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,63,"I cannot in strict accuracy recommend this film. It's such a jumble of action and motivation, ill-defined characters and action howlers."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,60,"Moves in fits and starts, with some crafty and credible fight choreography by Xin Xin Xiong on either side of the pretty but boring middle hour."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,"If this is Dumas, there's a ""b"" in the middle and an extra ""s"" at the end."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,A handsome but ho-hum swashbuckler that springs to life only during a few spirited scenes of acrobatic swordplay.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,"Its failure to be extraordinary is thus all the more cutting, and its redundancy all the more unforgivable."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,"Rollicks and rolls, thanks mainly to Roth's over-the-top depravity and Xiong's swingin', ""Crouching Tiger""-style choreography."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,50,The novelty value of seeing 17th-century French swordsmen fight like Chinese martial artists doesn't compensate for the film's generally wooden performances and clichéd dialogue.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,40,Appallingly flat.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,38,"East/West fusion aside, The Musketeer is a stale Euro-pudding."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,38,"Dramatically as well as visually, The Musketeer conflicts with itself by trying to blend grand old- school costume drama and MTV- style rhythm and attitude into the same movie. The juxtapositions are often preposterous."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,33,"The movie lacks the one thing that the classic ""Three Musketeers"" story can't do without: panache."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,30,What a stupefying thing it is.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,30,"Musketeer's fight scenes are underlit, overmiked, and appallingly edited, with none of the spacious grace that even routine Asian action flicks get right. Worse, the narrative scenes make less sense."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"The Musketeer is the worst Hollywood period film in -- it seems like ages since ""American Outlaws."""
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"Hyams (""End of Days,"" ""Timecop""), who is his own cinematographer, has no idea how to shoot or compose Xiong's wired choreography."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"There isn't a frame of The Musketeer that's believable even as a Hollywood re-creation of a fantasy world. It's conventionally picturesque, except in the nighttime and interior scenes, which are dark to the point of glaucoma."
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,Unspeakably awful.
The Musketeer,4.8,27073640,25,"Has the distinction of being the very worst of all the many film versions of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel, ""The Three Musketeers."" Nothing else in Musketeer movie history comes even remotely close to its staggering wretchedness."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,75,"The story has been brought to the screen twice before (once by Tsui), but this version is the first in IMAX 3-D, which is the main reason to see it."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,75,"Silly, distracting, and undeniably entertaining."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,75,"Tsui Hark's film is the veteran director's chance to let his imagination run riot in the context of a high-budget, 3D IMAX production."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,70,"A chunky spectacle, to be sure – overstuffed with plot and characters - but at times, it's an insanely entertaining one."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,70,"Surprisingly old-fashioned. It seems to be having an argument with itself: the dazzling but often antiseptic immersiveness of the viewing experience is countered by storytelling suffused with nostalgia for a simpler, messier, livelier period in Chinese film."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,60,"Flying Swords might not live up to the promise of Detective Dee, Hark's recent comeback, but it does deliver frequently and always when it counts most."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,50,"The 3D is terrific in Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, but helmer Tsui Hark's costume actioner -- the first Chinese-lingo movie shown in the stereoscopic Imax format -- is let down by two-dimensional characters."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,40,"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate isn't as much fun as the director's previous film – the wondrous ""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame."""
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,40,"Despite the presence of Jet Li, only the last half-hour of this chatty epic truly flies."
Long men fei jia,6.0,170276,40,"Tsui Hark's films aren't famous for their coherence, but Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is such a wantonly incomprehensible experience that it occasionally feels like an epic piece of outsider art."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,88,"A dizzying lowlife saga that’s fast, smart, wicked, sort of ambitious and blazingly ironic. It’s as unpredictable as a Lindsay Lohan drive to the grocery store, as overstuffed as the pictures on Anthony Weiner’s Twitter feed and as hilarious as me on the bench press."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"In telling a true story about hapless thugs who are the embodiment of Michael Bay fans, the director has made the most fiendishly enjoyable movie of his career."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,It's funny as hell at times with a twisted sense of humor that one typically expects from the likes of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"This is easily Bay’s best movie, the work of a filmmaker with a cracked sense of humor that he is able to share with the audience."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"Even though Pain & Gain does indeed mine laughs from some very violent acts, there is nothing in this movie that glamorizes those three meatheads. Kudos to Bay and his screenwriters for making sure we’re laughing at them, not with them."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"With Pain & Gain, his surprising true-crime comedy, Bay has finally decided to lighten up a bit."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,Pain & Gain gives you a rush while at the same time making you queasy about how you’re getting off.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,Michael Bay sends a clear message to those of us who've been making fun of him: He's been in on the joke the whole time.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,"It's like a giant sculpture that is so strange and off-putting, it's instantly, intriguingly post-modern. Swept up in the film's pile-driving self-assurance, even Bay-haters may absorb the pain to enjoy the gain."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,"As ambitious and vibrant as it is ugly and scattershot, Pain & Gain is the most charming Michael Bay movie in a long while."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,An outrageous based-on-real-life tale that's perfectly suited to director Michael Bay's insanely overblown stylistic and thematic temperament.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,"It’s just too much — too much graphic violence, too many plot wrinkles, too much stupidity, too many supporting players to track...For a movie as physically fit as this one wants to be, Pain & Gain is carrying way too much extra weight."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,The movie needed some more detachment – and brevity – but Wahlberg shows once again he has the comedy chops.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"The ever-present air of madcap, goofball insanity carries it through. A seriously guilty pleasure."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"Michael Bay goes back to a Bad Boys budget and a big boys’ rating, for a true-life crime story that’s inconsistent and frenetic, but also funny and wilfully outrageous."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"Like all of Bay’s work, it’s over-the-top, brash and exhausting to watch. But like the lifestyle its characters aspire to, there’s an allure too."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,Wahlberg and Johnson are the saving graces of an in-your-face movie.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,It all leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"A day and half after walking out with a sensation, primarily, of physical relief—at two hours and nine minutes, Pain & Gain makes for a long, loud, relentlessly assaultive sit—I find that my thumb is wavering at half-mast. I’m still not sure whether to mildly like or mildly hate this movie."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,Nobody in it seems to possess a nervous system.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,The script’s occasional gestures toward making this an allegory of the failed American dream are extremely unconvincing in the context of a movie that revels in the excesses of macho culture while laughing at the hapless and stupid who can’t get it right.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"That sense of extreme, excess, over-the-top everything is there from start to finish. And isn't that what Bay fans count on even at cut-rate prices?"
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"A badly constructed, blood-spattered caper that comes unglued early on."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Yep, it's all fun and games until someone gets brutalized repeatedly. Before you can avert your eyes, it's Katie, bar the door and break out the chain saws."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,Bay blankets the film in a tone of smug self-awareness that obscures everything but its bald hypocrisy.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"There’s a certain kinetic charm to the first half of the movie, a freewheeling silliness to these outsized characters that makes you curious to see just how wrong things will go. But as the weightlifters’ plot spirals out of control, so does the movie’s."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Yes, the canon invoked for this film is that of the Three Stooges, but it’s still not as magnificently berserk as they can be. Set your expectations carefully for this one."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Bay can be a master of exuberant chaos, but here the violence mostly lands with a sickening thud, which is fitting, one supposes, but also ultimately numbing."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"The movie's best performance — and worst defamation — belongs to Tony Shalhoub, playing the first victim as a conniving, egotistical jerk who deserves to be kidnapped, maimed and ruined financially."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,42,"This is a tragedy, not a comedy."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,40,"When the story runs off the rails and crashes headfirst into a too-perfect ending, it's because Bay was led astray by the same things that got the Sun Gym Gang into this mess in the first place: superficiality, ambition, and the belief that reality just isn't good enough."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,40,"It's Bay World. And after an hour of Pain & Gain, it felt more like ""Pain & Pain."""
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,38,Pain & Gain fails at being an entertaining and ridiculously fun Michael Bay movie and curdles into something much more tone deaf and obnoxious.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,33,"The whole thing is played for laughs that almost never come. To be sure, the film has its moments, but they’re few and far between."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Bay seems to have been gunning for something along the lines of ""Blood Simple"" or ""A Simple Plan,"" but Pain & Gain is just plain simple."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Pain & Gain, a jokey but fatally tone-deaf true-crime caper, plays like “Fargo” for idiots."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Any pretensions of satire, moral ambiguity, or social commentary get lost in a hurricane of empty, mindless spectacle."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"It would be kind to call this satire; what it comes off as is a pummeling, testosterone-fueled sensory assault that the film then makes minor variations on for two very long hours."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,20,The story is told in a hammer-on-anvil manner that evinces no gift for social satire or sharp cultural insight.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,20,"In between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim, Bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh. Pain and Gain is personal all right. You leave these characters with the distinct impression that they're Bay's kind of people."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,12,"Michael Bay's absurdist comedy is all pain, no gain and an utter monstrosity. It may be the most unpleasant movie I've ever seen, and I'm not forgetting ""Freaks,"" which Pain & Gain resembles, come to think of it."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,75,"Thankfully, much of Red Tails is spent in the skies, where fighter planes swoop and zoom in thrilling dogfights with incendiary direct hits. Executive producer George Lucas apparently gave Hemingway the keys to his CGI kingdom, creating marvelously designed in-flight action and a sappy, snappy salute to the Tuskegee Airmen."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,75,"Overreaching fits of melodrama, occasionally stilted dialogue, and performances by Gooding Jr. and Howard that are mostly a series of serious faces can't keep the shiny Red Tails from taking flight."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,75,"A well-acted, well-directed (by TV veteran Anthony Hemingway) popcorn movie with great aerial battles and solid dramatic scenes that hold your attention for two good hours."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,70,"Perhaps the movie's most surprising feat? Somehow, the darned thing mostly works, probably because its heart is in the right place."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,67,"Kudos to the makers Red Tails for paying homage to a remarkable group of men and their genuinely heroic deeds, and a hat-tip as well for the idea that the best way to tell the story was the old-fashioned way.  But would that the film's old-school aura felt knowingly retro rather than dutifully rote."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,67,"As long as it stays in the air, Red Tails is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie. On the ground, it's a far shakier experience: dutiful and prosaic, with thinly scripted episodes that don't add up to a satisfying story."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,"Sadly, the result is a disappointment. Sure, the aerial battles are technically adept and occasionally exhilarating, but it's almost painful to sit through some of the ""drama"" that occurs on the ground."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,"David Oyelowo stands out as the daredevil Joe ""Lightning"" Little, the unit's best flier. With his bravery and bravado, he's the film's most complex character."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,"There isn't a real, flesh-and-blood figure in the bunch. Everything about Red Tails - the breaking down of racial barriers, the military achievements, the courage and sacrifice - is diminished in the process."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,63,Red Tails is entertaining. Audiences are likely to enjoy it. The scenes of aerial combat are skillfully done and exciting.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,60,"Such a story is made to be colored in jumbo crayon, and at first you might long for a more nuanced approach, but this film was produced in the 1940's serial style that's made Lucas Films enormous."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,60,"In the end Red Tails is mostly about the coolness of flying. Its heart is in the clouds, instead of with the men at the controls."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,58,"When a great movie subject results in a middling movie, the loss is double."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,You leave Red Tails thinking of what might have been instead of what is – a missed opportunity.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Red Tails is both a stirring and simplistic tribute to the men that not only shattered the U.S. Army Air Corps' racial barrier but also saved the lives of many a white, B-17 crew member, all while downing countless numbers of Hitler's formidable, jet-propelled Luftwaffe."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Where Spielberg has made WWII a venue for his sanctimonious side, a platform to convince viewers that war is indeed hell, Lucas is still in a state of pre-adolescent fascination with the conflict."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"The movie is so desperate to be palatable, to appeal to everybody that it doesn't taste like anything."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Every character here is so squeaky-clean, and the prejudice as depicted is so toothless and easily overcome, that the film feels like a gingerly fantasy version of what, in real life, was an exceptional example of resilient trail-blazing."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,50,"Red Tails squanders a great subject, reducing the real-life struggles and fierce heroics of the Tuskegee Airmen to rickety cliche."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,42,"The aerial sequences look an awful lot like X-wing-versus-TIE-fighter battles and the effects have the same not-quite-solid feel of the Star Wars prequels. When the heroes crash, they go up in blazes of digital glory that seem just as artificial as the plotting that brought them to their fates."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"For all the occasional grace of its high-flying derring-do, Red Tails barely feels like a movie. It's an uncertain hodgepodge of impulses and desires that never coheres enough to even crash and burn."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,To say that this live-action comic book lives up to Mr. Lucas's description is not a wholehearted endorsement. Are teenage boys as naïve today as they were 60 or more years ago? And much of the dialogue is groaningly clunky. But so it was back then.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"One could argue that the target audience - black teenagers, Mr. Lucas has said - might be most receptive to a film that conveys history through contemporary entertainment. But this isn't contemporary entertainment, it's antiquated kitsch reprocessed by the producer's nostalgia for the movies of his boyhood. The story has been stripped of historical context - don't black teenagers and everyone else deserve hard facts? - and internal logic."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"Alas, it was George Lucas who became captivated by the Tuskegee Airmen and has, after many years as devoted producer, managed to turn their story into a feature film that falls much closer to the goofy ""Hogan's Heroes"" in the spectrum of World War II-focused productions than ""Saving Private Ryan."""
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"Apart from the occasional thrill provided by CG-enhanced aerial dogfights, this stuffy history lesson about the groundbreaking African-American fighter pilot division never quite takes off, weighed down by wooden characters and leaden screenwriting."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"George Lucas produced this candy-coated, fictionalized drama, and while its cast is first-rate and its flying sequences sharp, the movie is as glazed and wide-eyed as a 70-year-old comic book."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,"George Lucas served as executive producer for this effects-heavy action film about the Tuskegee Airmen, and it feels as synthetic and dull as ""The Phantom Menace."""
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,40,So narratively old-fashioned it creaks.
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,38,"Virtue aside, however, Red Tails is a lousy film. Not wincingly bad, mind you, just mediocre."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,38,"The war-movie cliches are as abundant as the antiaircraft fire, and the dialogue as wooden as a balsa glider. The leading characters are issued one personality trait apiece, and some don't even get that. Cuba Gooding Jr., for example, plays Maj. Emanuelle Stance as a man who smokes a pipe."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,30,"Remember that scene from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" when a swastika-stamped Nazi crate explodes for no good reason (beyond the fact that the Ark hates Nazis)? Red Tails is like that, only less awesome, and considerably longer."
Red Tails,5.9,49876377,25,What's missing is any hint of realism. There's no grit to it anywhere.
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,50,"[Norris] is a kind of whitebread Bruce Lee, with no screen presence to speak of, but nothing terribly offensive working against him, either. He is just sort of there...Silent Rage may be trying to say something here about wealthy technicians and the popular culture, but then the psychopath or Mr. Norris appear and the thought gets lost."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,40,"The idea of pitting karate champion Norris against a virtually indestructible psychopath is intriguing, but the resulting confusion of clichés proves disappointingly incompetent."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,40,"Filled with implausibilities and unintentionally funny moments, this early Norris feature was little more than an excuse for the actor to use his karate skills. Exploitative in nature, but popular with its audiences."
Silent Rage,5.5,10490791,30,Silent Rage seems as if it were made with a demographics sampler entitled ’10 Sleazy Ways to Cash in on the Exploitation Market’. The result is a combination horror-kung fu-oater-woman in peril-mad scientist film with more unintentional laughs than possible in the space of 100 minutes.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,63,"At its best, TMNT does recall the slangy fun of the series' glory days. But there are too many moments when it feels as stale as one of Mikey's half-eaten pizzas."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,63,"TMNT has a cool, noirish sheen. There's an attention to detail in the visuals and sound design that pushes it up several notches above most kiddie fare. It's not art, dude, but it will do."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,58,This all-CG reboot is missing the goofy excitement of the old TMNT.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,58,"The story -- something to do with an ancient evil returning after 3,000 years -- plays like a multi-episode story arc of the TV series."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,58,Only those already predisposed to love a TMNT movie that at least LOOKS edgy are likely to care.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"A tad too conservative and calculated. CGI delivers best on moody sets and a noirish atmosphere achieved by lighting, backgrounds and visual effects. But the characters look like plastic dolls, and the story is recycled sci-fi."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Munroe's script denies fans the satisfaction of a decent story or amusing interactions. Rather than waiting for a screenplay that warranted their bigscreen return, TMNT feels like an attempt to exploit the phenomenon further."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Writer-director Kevin Munroe parties like it's 1989, grooving on the extreme-sports set pieces and vintage slang to generally cowabusted effect."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,The upshot is that the film is technically superb and quite enjoyable as long as you don't bang your head against the plot.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"That's really what TMNT lacks most -- humor. Despite the doll-like cartoonishness of the human figures, the filmmakers seem to expect us to take this animated romp seriously. Too seriously."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Silly, but an enjoyable, well-paced fantasy-action story."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"Fans should be satisfied, but it's hard to imagine anyone else will be much interested in TMNT."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"The movie is a serviceable way to pass the time: Kids will cheer the bright colors and funny new words (""Kowabunga!"")."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,50,"With your sharper minds, you'll probably figure it out. I hope so. Hope you'll like the movie too. But here's a bit of advice: Don't bet your allowance on it. Make Daddy pay."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,40,"The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,40,"I expected to see the triumphant return of my childhood favorites, yet I feel like this wasn't the answer."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,38,It takes more than an awkward title attempting to sound cool to overcome its mundane plot and silly dialogue.
TMNT,6.3,54149098,38,"Bummer, dudes. Longtime fans who expect the fun lingo and pizza-gobbling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of the past may be shocked by director Kevin Munroe's reimagining of the popular kiddie series."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,38,"The movie pretty much exists to sell tie-in products, and it's about as entertaining as watching little kids playing with their toys in the sandbox."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,25,"Without the brute vigilante junk, this 82-minute picture would be approximately 2 minutes long."
TMNT,6.3,54149098,20,It's all probably too slippery for the youngest viewers to grasp and too sketchy for the nostalgia crowd (for whom this revival seems most geared).
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,63,"The Legend of Billie Jean is trashily manipulative and utterly preposterous, so much so that, until the end (when it begins to sour on you), it's a thoroughly enjoyable hoot. Add a splendid cast and good air conditioning, and it's a perfectly mindless way to spend a muggy summer evening."
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,50,"The Legend of Billie Jean' is competently made, sometimes attractively acted, and bankrupt beyond belief. It's hard to imagine that even the film makers, let alone audiences, can believe in a sweet, selfless heroine who just can't help becoming a superstar."
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,50,Four-letter words and gags about periods fail to disguise the adolescent wish-fulfilment quality of script and direction.
The Legend of Billie Jean,6.6,3099497,50,"Though obviously designed for the teenage market, Billie Jean should insult the intelligence of all but the most irredeemable mall rats."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,90,An unknown treasure of a fantasy film and well worth a look for fans of the genre.
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,80,"In many ways, Dragonslayer is a realistic fairy tale. All of the classic pieces are here: heroes, bad guys, monsters, virgins in peril, mysticism and staggering odds."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,80,"The film excels as a visual exercise, as a study in adolescent psychology, and even as astute political analysis (it's the dragon who holds the fiefdom together)."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,80,"The scenes involving the dragon are first-rate. The beast is one of the meanest, ugliest, most reprehensible creatures I've ever seen in a film, and when it breathes flames it looks like it's really breathing flames."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,75,The giant computerized dragon alone is worth viewing. But Dragonslayer profits from spirited direction and camera work plus the expert Richardson at its nucleus.
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,75,"Dragonslayer has pacing problems, and its special effects tend to be more overpowering than helpful. But it also has a sweetness and conviction that amount to a kind of magic."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,70,This movie has two big things going for it—the dragon and the man who masterminds its slaying.
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,70,"Verges on the nasty for the nippers; sails close to déjà vu for fantasy fans; fated, probably, to damnation by faint praise."
Dragonslayer,6.7,14110013,63,"A well intentioned fantasy with some wonderful special effects, Dragonslayer falls somewhat short on continuously intriguing adventure."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,80,"This 'affectionate parody' of the swashbuckling Zorro myth is so determinedly amiable that one feels distinctly caddish for regretting that the laughs are not even more frequent. It fails only in that Leibman's villain shouts too much, and that the set pieces, the skeleton of most film comedy, are under-considered."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,80,"Despite an inspired, offbeat performance by George Hamilton, Zorro, the Gay Blade doesn't have nearly enough gags to sustain its 93 minutes. For the most part this is a Zorro with a very dull edge."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,70,"This movie is, of course, intended as a comedy, and it has some funny moments. But it's just not successful, and I think the reason is that Hamilton never for a second plays Zorro as if he were really playing Zorro... When a movie sets out a create a funny Zorro, that's bringing coals to Newcastle. By playing every scene for laughs, Hamilton has nothing to play against."
Zorro: The Gay Blade,6.1,11118000,70,"This one-joke film beats its punch line to death, playing its gay character for big laughs with generally predictable and boring results. Hamilton (who coproduced) chews up the scenery with relish, and the bland supporting performances yield to his campy caricature, But the subtle element of self-parody that distinguished the best of the Zorro films is absent, and the gay stereotype is more offensive than comical."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,63,"A lively, good-looking kiddie action comedy best left to those under 10. Although their attention may wander, parents can be grateful that there's some substance as well as fun in this Disney release, for martial arts is presented as a matter of defense rather than aggression, emphasizing that it is a matter of mind and spirit as well as body and requiring resourcefulness and discipline."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,63,"While one could wish the film offered something more original than its strictly formula heroics, it benefits from a generous portion of charm. And most kids attending 3 Ninjas are likely to stand up and cheer the rousing, action-packed finale."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,60,"Brazenly exploitative stuff, stirring in anything which has done the business in kids' movies previously, this, of course, should have its target audience laughing like drains."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,60,"The film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy, a fantasy or an adventure film. Mr. Kingsley's villain gnashes his teeth and snorts, I love being the bad guy. Those who displease him are threatened with the tearing out of a heart or liver. The character ends up being neither scary nor funny, while the boys are so busy demonstrating their superhuman skills that no personalities emerge."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,50,"Can the trio use their ninja secrets to escape? Will granddad defeat the gun-runner in hand-to-hand combat? If you can't guess the answers to these questions you are under 11 and will absolutely love this film, with its amazing fight scenes, bungling Home Alone kidnappers and thoroughly nasty bad guys. Send mum and dad shopping."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,50,"3 Ninjas is basically harmless, but it's not entertaining enough to fully engage adults or the under-12 set -- especially once the popcorn and sodas have been polished-off."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,40,A miserable ripoff of The Karate Kid with three whitebread young-uns taking lessons from their Chinese grandfather on how to be upright and horizontal ninja warriors. They get their kicks trying to knock off a Steven Seagal imitation who is running drugs.
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,40,"The director, Jon Turtletaub, completely misses the character-driven appeal of the Karate Kid series, and there's no Macauley Culkin in this cast. The movie is saddled with a junky visual style, haphazard editing and occasional out-of-focus shots. Much of it looks like very bad television, although the toilet jokes and a running gag about laxatives and instant diarrhea may be a little raw for the Disney Channel."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,40,"3 Ninjas, Touchstone Pictures' latest attempt to fill the idle summer hours of our nation's youth, is a Frankenstein of a movie, an unhappy creature stitched together out of the body parts of other movies. And though it's not a horror film, it is a genuinely scary experience, if only because it actually seems to make time stand dead still."
3 Ninjas,5.3,29000301,30,"Even in this conglomerate era of marketed, predigested mediocrity, this Disney movie slips instantly into the humdrum."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,100,"Anyone who enjoys stylized hyper-violence should be enthralled by this long, sweeping, murderously vivid dramatization of ancient Chinese warfare, circa A.D. 208."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,90,"The immensity encompasses such variety, subtlety and intimacy that you may find yourself yearning for more."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,88,"This is magnificent filmmaking, and a magnificent film."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,88,"Red Cliff is a dichotomous beast: The computer-generated imagery that makes so much of it possible is served up in heaping, state-of-the-art portions, but the results occasionally border on the cartoonish. At the same time, Red Cliff is a classic tale that gets a classicist's treatment."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,83,The spectacular battle scenes are the engorged heart of the delirious adventure. But Woo also gets maximum romantic value from Tony Leung as a war hero married to Chiling Lin as the tea-pouring beauty.
Chi bi,7.4,627047,83,"Woo's hand is sure and his eye, as ever, finds beauty in everything, even death."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,"Camp, over-the-top and entirely unbelievable: in short, the best thing John Woo has made in years."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,"Balances character, grit, spectacle and visceral action in a meaty, dramatically satisfying pie that delivers on the hype and will surprise many who felt the Hong Kong helmer progressively lost his mojo during his long years stateside."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,"Red Cliff exudes a physical grandiosity that few movies of the past 20 years have attempted--no matter that Woo, even at his best, is still more at ease with down-and-dirty action than epic pageantry."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,80,It's a movie on the Hollywood scale that has so much of the Asian spirit. It has drawn the Asian audience back to the movie theater.
Chi bi,7.4,627047,75,A scrumptious war movie.
Chi bi,7.4,627047,75,"As expected, it has gaping holes where back stories used to be. Still, it's a historical war movie with impressive sweep, strong characterizations and the kind of idiosyncratic flourishes that made Woo such an irresistible storyteller."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,75,"We are reminded: War is hell. But at their best, war movies can be cool and beautiful."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"Any war picture in which the heroine stalls the villain with a quiet, painstaking tea ceremony until the wind shifts direction and the good guys can firebomb the bad guys into oblivion is too ineffably Zen not to love."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"A prelude that provides the beams and columns for the narrative framework, but with a few decisive and spot-on action spectacles, it sufficiently kindles expectations for the climactic clash in Part 2."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"While handsome and intelligent and perfectly easy to sit through, never really approaches the visceral tug of Mr. Woo’s Hong Kong hits."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,70,"Returning to his roots after a stint in Hollywood, Woo has made the most expensive film in mainland Chinese history, a pleasantly traditional picture that marks a new direction for one of the world's premier action maestros."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,67,"The film is both traditional and modern: austere in its engagement with history, and insistent in its showy action beats."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,67,"You may have the biggest flat-screen DLP monitor in the city, but Red Cliff will never look half as spectacular as it will on the big – and I mean really big – screen."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,63,"Even at 148 minutes (and viewed twice!), you still feel as if you’re watching the longest coming attraction ever for a John Woo movie."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,60,"For all his brilliance with choreography, Woo is flummoxed by the thousands of actual human extras, though there’s no denying his commitment to the finer points of battle tactics (yawn)."
Chi bi,7.4,627047,60,"Overlong but ambitious, Woo proves he's as good at tactical maneuvers as he is at close-quarters combat."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,75,"Stick it out through the first ten incoherent minutes or so, and Stealth is an invigorating reward, especially the tense final half-hour."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,67,"While you're in the theater, it's actually -- heaven help me -- pretty fun to watch."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,63,This giddy summer extravaganza does deliver aerial thrills with eye-dazzling visuals and ear-smacking (though beautifully designed) sound.
Stealth,5.0,32116746,63,"If you like hard bodies and hot engines, if you want to feel like you're inside a cockpit or a video game with someone else working the joystick, you'll find decent escape from the summer doldrums in Stealth."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,60,"If the Navy is looking for splashy recruiting tools, it could do worse than Stealth, a zillion-dollar action movie stuffed with futuristic jet fighters, glamorous carrier pilots and an overload of explosive, mostly digital derring-do."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,60,"A slick piece of summer entertainment that is counting on elaborate special effects to make its derivative, convoluted story line all but irrelevant."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,60,"On one level, Stealth is technically breathtaking, viscerally thrilling action cinema of the highest order. On another, it is slavering, state-of-the-art war porn."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,50,"A sort of retarded ""Top Gun,"" Rob Cohen's Stealth revisits the world of cocky fighter pilots and war games turned real, but it has some serious moral quandaries on the brain, and too much thinking gets it into trouble."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,50,"Even Cohen can't dull the loony romanticism of the movie’s finale and, to his credit, stages one truly spectacular bit of action midway through, when Biel bails out behind enemy lines and narrates each harrowing moment of her earthward plummet."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,50,"Though Stealth's strengths are obvious -- high-tech marvels and a good cast -- so are its flaws. At its worst moments, a mad robot seems to have taken over the movie, too."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,50,"Makes a serviceable summer shoot-'em-up, but it's surprisingly trashy and rather stupid, and its efforts toward being a gripping military drama in the Tom Clancy tradition are fairly pathetic."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,50,"While it's loaded with visceral thrills, it never rises above the level of an extended video game or an advertisement for the military."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,42,"Stealth, a dregs-of-summer knockoff, is too ponderous and inept to serve a comparable function now, yet the film's lack of thrust may be related to an absence of conviction about its own war-is-a-videogame clichés."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,40,"Hollywood's latest virtual movie, features impressive action sequences -- all created through technology -- a thin story, cardboard characters and snicker-inducing dialogue."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,40,"Aiming to join the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of American movie war games, Stealth is just too dumb to make the grade."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,40,Plays like a slapdash assemblage of the greatest hits of conspiracy-minded action cinema.
Stealth,5.0,32116746,38,"Plastic characters, chaotic camerawork, lots of things blowing up, and an incredibly dumb screenplay. In short, it represents a great time at the movies for anyone who has recently undergone a frontal lobotomy."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,38,"If Stealth were a recruitment film for aircraft-carrier duty, one would be tempted to say, ""Mission accomplished."" As a feature film, it's a washout."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,38,"Stealth is an offense against taste, intelligence and the noise pollution code -- a dumbed-down ""Top Gun"" crossed with the HAL 9000 plot from ""2001."""
Stealth,5.0,32116746,38,"Flimsy and forgettable, but it does have a few worthy action and special-effects sequences."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,30,The dialogue is often drowned out by engine noise.
Stealth,5.0,32116746,30,"What's interesting about Stealth isn't its nitwit story... No, what's interesting about this movie - and many others of its kind - is that it continues the love affair Hollywood, that hotbed of liberalism, has long had with militarism."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,30,"The scene where a pilot bails out in Stealth is so over-painted with CGI that it doesn't look as real as the sequence starring Shepard that inspired it in ""The Right Stuff,"" a movie made with model airplanes."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,25,Stealth is basically the kind of movie a 13-year-old boy given an infinite budget and creative freedom might cook up between Xbox games.
Stealth,5.0,32116746,25,"It's astonishing what little impact even the most imaginatively choreographed and well-filmed aerial escapades can have when they're presented as neither an expression of a character's personality, nor in the context of a compelling mission."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,25,"Cohen (The Fast and the Furious, xXx) is no stranger to cornball excess but Stealth is his chef-d'oeuvre, a movie so audaciously preposterous and jingoistic it plays like a parody of the genre."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,25,"Its action sequences, more geeky than thrilling, fail to rescue the laughable plot."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,20,"Even by the degraded standards of dim-witted summer blockbusters, this is sorry stuff."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,20,"For a movie to pretend, in the face of the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children directly or indirectly caused by our presence there, that we can wage war without anyone really getting hurt isn't naive, or wishful thinking, or a jim-dandy way to spend a Saturday night at the movies. It's an obscenity."
Stealth,5.0,32116746,12,It's not new. It's not interesting. I wish it would go away.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,100,"Either Live Free or Die Hard will go down as the summer's best action blockbuster, or it's going to be one exceptional summer."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,91,Easily the best in the series since the first one.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,90,It's simply old-school stunts and movie magic.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,90,"Though the movie's at least 20 minutes too long, it's deeply satisfying, full of old-school buddy banter and the kind of action sequences that make you burst out laughing at their sheer audacity."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,The sheer quantity of often outrageous stunts should help overcome franchise mustiness to entertain.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"A slick and efficient piece of action entertainment, fast moving with energetic stunt work and nice thriller moves."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"Does it herald a renaissance in the action genre? Not really, but it's a welcome throwback to good old-fashioned, '80s-style lunkhead violence, and no one takes a punch, kick, elbow, or bullet quite like John McClane."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"Provided you don't think too long or hard about it (and why ever would you?), Live Free or Die Hard is infectious good fun, and a tremendous encouragement to the middle aged."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Early in LFODH, a villain taunts our hero, calling him ""a Timex in a digital world""; McClane, characteristically, takes the dig as a compliment. Two hours, countless butt-kickings and hairbreadth escapes later, we know why."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"The film's action doesn't disappoint; if anything, it ups the adrenaline ante considerably."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Willis, who at 52 looks great in an intensely physical role and can still spit out wisecracks and insults with the best of them."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Director Len Wiseman, confidently stepping up from the smallish budget ""Underworld"" films to mega-budget Hollywood mainstream."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"The action in this fast-paced, hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining film is as realistic as a Road Runner cartoon."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Surprisingly effective, rousing entertainment, which boasts plenty of old-school, at times jaw-dropping stunt work done the manly way."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"At a time when the action genre has come to be dominated by sleek, matte surfaces and set-'em-and-forget-'em computerized effects, Live Free or Die Hard seeks to remind viewers of the simple, nostalgic pleasures of watching stuff get blown up and bad guys get smoked."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"Bruce Willis is ready to earn our love again by performing the same lovably violent, meathead tricks as before."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"Willis' John McClane, with that sly, sideways smile, is like an old acquaintance you don't mind running into. He may be older and balder, but he's none the worse for the wear. And he can still take a punch."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,67,"Superior in every way to 1995's ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" Live Free or Die Hard's goofy generation-gap gambit pays off decently and proves, again, that nattily dressed terrorists are no match for Willis, the once and future Patron Saint of Bang."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,Gets the action job done and you better believe that Bruce is still the man.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"The key to enjoying the fourth installment in this testosterone-fueled franchise is accepting that it's a live-action cartoon that makes no effort to conform to the laws of gravity, plausibility or common sense."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"In the moments at his disposal, Smith almost steals the flick. He's so wittily government-phobic that I found myself hoping for a climax that would blow Bruce Willis away and promote Kevin Smith to saviour-of-the-free-world. Now that might be a sequel worth rooting for."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"Sorry, boys. After two decades, the first film still does more with one skyscraper than Live Free or Die Hard does with an entire country."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"Directed in workmanlike style by Underworld: Evolution's Len Wiseman, has its share of wild stunts and spectacular carnage, but it feels pokey and predictable, too."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"An unexpectedly retro throwback to '80s actioners and '90s hacker movies, totally preposterous in both its heroic near-death escapes and abstract tech-jargon explanations for how anyone with geeky inclinations can remotely override any computer system with a few easy keystrokes."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,I can safely say I've never seen anything as ridiculous as Live Free or Die Hard. I'm not saying my 10-year-old self didn't enjoy a lot of it.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,Take away Bruce Willis and this is straight-to-video material.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,60,Yippee-ki-yay! Willis still has the goods.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,58,A middling contender in this summer of gigantoid sequels.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,58,"Willis does everything short of donning a cape and reversing time by orbiting the Earth at light speed, and the air of cheerful ridiculousness recalls Luc Besson-produced action films like ""Transporter 2"" or ""District B13."""
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"Diverting enough if you want to see plenty of fast-paced action sequences, some heart-stopping chase scenes and plenty of things blow up."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"Maybe McClane, in '80s action parlance, is too old for this s---."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"The physical stunts by Maggie Q as a lethal martial arts expert and Cyril Raffaelli as a Eurotrash sniper who rappels buildings are more thrilling than the over-the-top chase sequences, so contrived as to verge on self-parody."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,75,There is such a joy of play in the film that it's easy to overlook the overdone performances and the lazy script shortcuts.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,75,"You can't get this kind of full-on sensory-jolt anywhere else, not legally anyway. ""Sharkboy"" will be equally beloved in elementary schools and in college dorms."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,70,Slight but immensely enjoyable charmer.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,70,"On the whole it feels genuine. Lautner and Dooley are compelling as the sullen, instinctual Sharkboy and the radiant, hot-headed Lavagirl, and it's easy to see why they dominate shy, hesitant Max's dreams."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,60,Robert Rodriguez and his kids conjure up a charming 3-D fantasy.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,An often imaginative though less than magical family feature.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"There's little chance of grabbing teens (or even many tweens) during summertime playdates. Still, small fry will be enchanted by this rambunctious action-adventure."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"The result is like a low-rent ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Labyrinth,"" sticking close to the formula of a kid who falls asleep and wakes up in a fantastical wonderland where everything's just a little bit off."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,A case of a yummy yarn spoiled by cheesy visuals.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"Only part of it is in 3-D, but youngsters should enjoy pulling their special specs on and off at appropriate moments."

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"A strange Hollywood film, but for a home movie it's one bang-up job."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"Because the real world scenes are in 2-D and the dream and fantasy scenes are in 3-D, we get an idea of what the movie would have looked like without the unnecessary dimension. Signs flash on the screen to tell us when to put on and take off our polarizing glasses, and I felt regret every time I had to shut out those colorful images and return to the dim and dreary 3-D world. On DVD, this is going to be a great-looking movie."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,50,"For a movie aimed at children, Shark Boy and Lava Girl is gloomy."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,42,"Like choral singing and travel photography, this adventure is more fun for participants than it is for spectators."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,42,"A story that would be charming if recited at the dinner table tries to carry a feature film, and it's not even close to the task. The result is screamingly bad."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,40,"Mr. Rodriguez seems unsure what his film is really about, making the moral of the story -- ""dream an unselfish dream"" -- feel more like a vaguely judgmental homily than a satisfying conclusion."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,38,There's really just not a lot here. I'm sure Racer's story will entertain the very wee ones -- but so do keys.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,38,The story's so sloppy that it contradicts itself constantly.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,38,"There's sad news to report about The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D: Put on the cardboard glasses, and you can still see the movie."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,38,"The low-tech film looks like a kid's crude drawing, plays like entry-level Game Boy, and is about as nourishing as a Tootsie Pop."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,38,As sweet and hopeless and silly as a doting dad framing his second-grader's latest finger-painting and calling it a Matisse.
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,30,"Pretty lame.  Sharkboy has an especially frantic, amateur atmosphere, with a mostly maladroit cast."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,30,"Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside ""100%"" spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,30,"Sadly, the film's creaky, sometimes painful dialogue makes it all too easy to believe that it was genuinely co-written by a small child."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,30,"The concept is cute and the movie starts out well, but it devolves into a muddled, overstuffed mess that wears out its welcome around the time the novelty of 3-D effects wears off."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,25,"One could forgive a budget this threadbare, performances this amateurish, a plot this tortuous if the 3-D effects passed the cool test. Sadly, watching ''Adventures"" is an experience akin to seeing the world through dung-colored glasses."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,25,"Sharkboy relies almost entirely on 3-D for its kicks. The novelty, however, quickly wears thin with the thinnest of stories to project."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,20,"Visually undistinguished, narratively inert, populated by a cast of charmless child actors, ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl,"" with any luck will fade quickly from theaters, memories and Rodriguez's own Things to Do Today list."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,20,"A bizarre, hopelessly muddled fantasy that's likely to induce utter bewilderment in its target audience."
The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,3.5,39177684,10,"The result is astoundingly boring and, frankly, tedious to sit through."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,88,It's a first-class ride. All aboard.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,88,"While director Tony Scott's brash and boisterous take on the material may lack that certain '70s quirkiness, it gets just about everything else exactly right."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,83,Scott gets into the zip and rush of urban energy with an enthusiasm bordering on hilarity.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,80,"More than anything a fascinating portrait of how much New York has changed in 35 years, the film delivers the goods in excitement and big-star charisma."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,80,A fast and relentless hostage thriller that never stops.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,80,"Even at a distance from each other (Washington/Travolta), they conduct a tag-team master class in old-style movie star technique, barreling through every cliché and nugget of corn the script has to offer with verve and conviction. Even when you don't really believe them, they're always a lot of fun to watch."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,80,Crisp supporting turns by John Turturro (as a hostage negotiator) and James Gandolfini (as the mayor) combine with plenty of vehicular mayhem to make this a superior diversion.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"Gripping and compelling, and doesn't make us wish we had checked our brains at the theater entrance."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"The new Pelham takes the chilling original premise and modifies it for an era steeped in technology, making for an energetic and engrossing adaptation."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"The new ""Pelham,"" although no classic, is a lot of fun if you're in the right mood."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"Has all the usual virtues of a good action suspense drama, but it lacks that extra something - that context, that vital interchange - that made the original ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" such a memorable experience in 1974."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,75,"Tony Scott pushes all the right buttons, crafting a worthy -- and in many ways, a superior -- update."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,70,So professionally done you rarely have the luxury of taking your eyes off the screen.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,67,"The film is thus more of a technical showcase than a human drama. It's diverting enough until it gets dumb, but so strong from the start is the certainty that dumb is on the way that you can't get too vexed when it finally arrives."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,67,"Whereas the original, directed by Joseph Sargent, was essentially a well-oiled B movie, the new incarnation, directed by Tony (""Enemy of the State"") Scott, is bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over-the-top camera flourishes."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,63,"There's not much wrong with Tony Scott's The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, except that there's not much really right about it."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,63,"The movie is slick, predictable and, thanks mainly to Washington's canny underplaying, fairly diverting."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,63,"By itself, the new ""Pelham"" is a solid, suspenseful tale all over again, so long as it stays in the subway tunnels and airless offices of the transit department."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,63,"Washington offers another of his rock-steady performances, playing a career civil servant with a couple of secrets of his own, but confident, diligent, ready to go the distance for the city he loves."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,60,"Curiously, despite the ever-energetic Tony Scott at the throttle, the sleek new edition isn't as transporting as it should have been."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,60,"If Hollywood is going to remake a '70s movie, it might as well be Pelham, and it ought to work as competently as this one. But wouldn't it be nice, once in a while, for Hollywood to turn contemporary traumas into vigorous movies instead of hijacking the anxieties of the past?"
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,Watching this Pelham--a money job from its conception--you can believe that there's no other motivation on Earth.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,"Scott's redo comes up short in almost every regard against the '74 model--against David Shire's knuckled-brass score, against its mugs' gallery of '70s New York character actors, against Peter Stone's serrated script, and certainly against its wordless punchline."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,Just plain silly.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,It's easy to imagine why Pelham's producers wouldn't want Scott's professional but dull picture to be compared with the 1974 classic.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,"An efficiently engineered piece of studio product, enjoyable enough at times, but with an unmistakable assembly-line quality."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,"Yet most of the film's energy is generated by flamboyant cinematography and music-video cutting, and much of that energy is false."
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,50,"Any chance to generate atmosphere or sustained comedy and melodrama goes down the tubes, often literally."

The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,40,Pelham One was first class. Pelham Two stuck to the schedule. Pelham Three needs a bus pass.

The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,25,Tony Scott’s bracingly awful remake/desecration of the classic ‘70s thriller.
The Taking of Pelham 123,6.4,65452312,20,"Loud, abrasive, and featuring performances seemingly calibrated to be heard over the cacophonous roar of Travolta's mad, bad overacting."

8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,75,It’s a fine swan song for Ashby.
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,60,"The plot doesn’t make much sense, but the film is filled with lovely little moments courtesy of Bridges, who brings a casualness to this character
that feels right."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,50,"What could have been a better film delving into complexities of one tough-but-vulnerable alcoholic sheriff out to bust a cocaine ring, instead ends up an oddly-paced work that is sometimes a thriller and sometimes a love story, succeeding at neither."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,40,"What happened? With Ashby, Bridges, Arquette and a script co-written by Oliver Stone, you expect the result to be better than a long drawn-out episode of The Equalizer."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,30,"8 Million Ways to Die is a ponderous, convoluted improbability, with more inexplicable actions and situations than ""The Big Sleep,"" which is the last time those two films will ever be mentioned in the same sentence."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,30,"Considering the major talents involved here, one would expect to find something more than a run-of-the-mill crime thriller. In a sense one does, for 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE is a paralyzingly inept film."
8 Million Ways to Die,5.7,1305114,30,HOW did Eight Million Ways to Die commit suicide? Let us count the ways.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,"Proves to be more than just a gimmick, and it doesn't skimp on any of the quirky wackiness that you might expect from a film about blob-shaped, flightless birds battling pigs."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,"And, make no mistake, this is a movie that is supposed to be seen from the perspective of a small child."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,There's no denying the movie's high spirits or its irresistible invitation to shake your sillies out.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,75,"The 3-D animated film delivers a mildly diverting mix of winky meta-jokes and moral lessons, cannily aimed at both the next generation of tiny consumers and their more sophisticated parents."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,70,"The animation punches well above its weight with properly Looney Tunes-standard sight gags, polished, highly expressive character design, and rendering so intensely computed nearly every barbule and rachis on each individual feather is visible."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,70,"A fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,63,Calling The Angry Birds Movie an “animated film” is giving it airs. It’s a cartoon. Deal with it.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,63,"The Angry Birds Movie is unnecessary but cute, like a bonnet on a cat — and there are certainly worse recommendations than that."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,60,"Screenwriter Jon Vitti and first-time directors Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis certainly give it a try, but their bag of tricks is mostly recycled and their sense of humor is aimed squarely at 12-year-old boys."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,50,"Don't get me wrong. Angry Birds doesn't depict any on-camera violence against person, bird, or pig. But there's a darkness at the heart of this movie that's hard to reconcile."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,50,"What starts out as a lowbrow gag very typical of a pedestrian ’toon gradually balloons into absurdity that Mel Brooks would probably love. Here, at least, the Angry Birds fly."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,50,"The Angry Birds Movie is fitfully funny but tends towards a madcap mixture of comedy and action which never develops much forward momentum.  The joke-a-minute approach misses more than it hits, although the bright animation and adorably-rendered characters are decent compensation."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,40,"If Angry Birds fully embraced its message, it could have been a refreshing surprise. But like the mindless video game that inspired it, there’s little here beyond fleeting satisfaction."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,40,"If you loved the game, you might enjoy watching the script contort itself into ever more zany shapes to incorporate the necessary elements: giant slings, teetering towers, boomeranging toucans. But it’s not enough to counteract the tiresome, sub-Lego Movie snarkiness of the script or the bright, busy and unengaging animation."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,The Angry Birds Movie isn’t a total turkey. The animation itself is OK and I did laugh out loud once.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,Smartphone apps don’t particularly lend themselves well to political allegory or satire. But that’s precisely what the makers of this fitfully amusing animated adaptation of the once-popular game seem to be fruitlessly attempting.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,"The Angry Birds Movie is a lot of things, but none of them true to the app's appeal."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,38,"Sudeikis is well-cast as a bird whose “cardinal sin” is cynicism, but he has virtually nothing funny to say."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,37,"It should come as no surprise that The Angry Birds Movie is a loud and dumb children’s film, but for what it’s worth, there are plenty of cinematic commercial ventures that are louder and dumber and so on than the well-meaning and slickly sold Birds."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,33,Perhaps just as disappointing as the haphazard storytelling is the squandering of a top-flight voice ensemble.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,33,"The kids of today deserve better. So do I, come to think of it."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,30,The Angry Birds Movie basically hits all the squares on the Lazily Conceived Family Cartoon bingo card.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,30,"The Angry Birds Movie is simply a pointless swirl of color and motion to babysit small children on home video in a few months. Sadly, such movies aren't an endangered species."
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,25,Most of the movie is lazily retrofitted for a variety of marketing opportunities. Some kids will probably like it anyway. But some kids also like toy commercials and singing chipmunks. It doesn’t mean they should actually watch them.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,25,The Angry Birds Movie is just fowl.
Angry Birds,6.3,107509366,20,"Maybe it’s supposed to be the enlightening tale of one bird’s self-redemption from neurotic negativity, but I just wanted to punch this film in the snout."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,60,"Stallone is sincere and soulful as a father who messed up pretty bad and just wants his kid back, Mendenhall is a likable tyke, and justice is served in the end."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,One of Mr. Stallone's more muddled efforts but by no means a flop on the order of F.I.S.T. or Rhinestone.
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"From the ongoing search to find new arenas in which Sylvester Stallone, against overwhelming odds, triumphs through exercise of the manly virtues, comes Over the Top, a movie about arm-wrestling. What's next? Crab soccer?"
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"Over the Top is pretty much like all of the other successful Stallone films, which probably means that it will be a success, too. In fact, it`s considerably better than the ragged, recycled Rocky IV, though it lacks the wild excesses that made Rambo and Cobra campily entertaining."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"With Over The Top, Stallone had clearly exploited the Rocky formula once too often and audiences rebelled against its condescending family melodrama and heavy-handed working-class trappings."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"Stallone will never disappoint his fans intentionally. He cowrote the script (if writing is the right word) with Stirling Silliphant to formula specs, but Over the Top hasn't got the muscle of his Rocky hits. It's Stallone showing his vulnerable side, a sort of Father Knows Best -- But Can't Put It Into Words."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,50,"There isn't a scintilla of surprise to any of it, and arm wrestling as a sport isn't really much fun to watch unless it's the match in The Fly. The only diversion is keeping track of the shameless advertising plugs that dot the film, like toadstools after a rain. It's not quite reason enough to go out to a movie, however."
Over the Top,5.7,16057580,40,"Arm wrestling, truck driving, weird weight lifting, and tear jerking are the stuff of this predictable Sylvester Stallone vehicle in which he plays Lincoln Hawk, a trucker-cum-wrist twister whose son, Michael (David Mendenhall), has been kept from him by his devious, wealthy father-in-law (Robert Loggia)."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,100,"Straightforward, energetic, updated Bard. 28-year-old star-director-adapter Kenneth Branagh's spellbinding version of Shakespeare's Henry isn't superior to Olivier's 1944 version - it's different, and complementary to it."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,100,"Big and pretty, vigorous, thoughtful, this Hamlet expands the story with helpful flashbacks."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,90,"Most astounding, though, is the power of the film's leading actor. While Branagh's direction is forthright and articulate, his acting is brash and flamboyant."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,90,"What works best in the film is the over-all vision. Branagh is able to see himself as a king, and so we can see him as one."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"The cast - including Derek Jacobi as the modern-dress chorus, Paul Scofield, Judi Dench, Ian Holm, Emma Thompson, and Robbie Coltrane in an effective cameo as Falstaff - is uniformly fine without any grandstanding."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"Branagh's Henry V must, however, be counted a success - it might never be as famous as Olivier's, but it should carry considerable clout for years to come."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"Mr. Branagh has made a fine, rousing new English film adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Henry V,'' a movie that need not apologize to Laurence Olivier's 1944 classic."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,88,"Henry V is a stirring, gritty and enjoyable pic which offers a plethora of fine performances from some of the U.K.'s brightest talents."
Henry V,7.6,10161099,80,"An alert, rousing interpretation of ""Henry V,"" Branagh beats down the doors of high art and drags the sleeping bard into the light of modern day."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"A gargantuan epic, a historical adventure-drama of overwhelming visual grandeur."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"Bloom finally comes into his own as a man here, somberly thoughtful and melancholic. The elfin archer of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the trivial boy-toy of ""Troy"" have been forgotten."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"Better than ""Gladiator"" -- deeper, more thoughtful, more about human motivation and less about action."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,83,"Its concept is gutsy, its script is literate and intelligent, its visuals and cinematic craftsmanship are mouth-dropping, and its vision of the insanity of various religions vying to dominate the real estate of the Holy Land comes through with great power."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable, Ridley Scott's latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,Fulfills the requirements of grand-scale moviemaking while serving as a timely reminder that in the conflict between Christianity and Islam it was the Christians who picked the first fight.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"In its depiction of a fleeting, but nevertheless factual, peace in the Middle East, Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven may seem a more quixotic Hollywood fantasy than all six Star Wars movies lumped together."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Scott and company have gotten so accomplished at re-creating history that the results have a welcome offhanded quality, making them spectacular without seeming to be showing off."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Full of astonishments, not the least of which are its ideas."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,78,"The story's parallels with the present are sometimes inescapable, as when Saladin's fireballs catapulted at Balian's castle strike an eerie resemblance to the ""shock and awe"" of the U.S.-led coalition's initial assault on Iraq."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Kingdom of Heaven may have problems, but it delivers."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Odd as it is to say, Kingdom of Heaven loses its momentum the more Balian gets religion."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"A rousing, politically correct, Muslim-sympathetic, $140 million take on the Crusades."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Scott's cast is like a grand orchestra with various performers filling the roles of instruments: Thewlis a wise, ironic oboe; Neeson a stout cello; Norton a slightly battered flute. As it happens, the piece they're playing is a piano concerto and the keyboard -- that is, Bloom -- isn't big enough to match."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,Screenwriter William Monahan has fashioned an intelligent and highly topical epic. Director Ridley Scott has brought it home with banners flying.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,The battle skirmishes here mix sudden violence with slow-motion artistry. The attractive cast can sell an obsession or articulate a conundrum with equal fervor.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,"So, if you want to see this loud but rather ordinary epic, don't expect its tricked-up cultural and theological messages to carry much water. For entertainment value, it's hard to beat the climactic siege of Jerusalem, a Ridley Scott-perfect half-hour that matches anything in ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"" for sheer, bloody, helmet-bashing mayhem."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,Thoughtful and impressively mounted.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,"Massoud plays Saladin magnetically, and his arrival only illustrates how many opportunities Kingdom misses. Another, better movie would have made him the focus."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,67,"Scott, working from a script by William Monahan, is so busy balancing our sympathies, making sure no one gets offended, that he has made a pageant of war that would have gotten a thumbs-up from Eleanor Roosevelt."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"But if the film disappoints on an intellectual level, at least it doesn't skimp on pageantry. This is, without question, one of the most beautifully crafted, visually thrilling war pictures ever made -- a painterly spectacle that leaves you looking for Caravaggio's name in the end credits."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"It's hard to say with assurance whether the flaw is in Bloom's performance or in Monahan's politically correct conception of Balian, precociously secular for a Crusader."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"Although Scott seems to be making a point about both parties' ongoing feud for Jerusalem , the movie seems more like a classic Western than a contemporary political allegory."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"For all its scale, grandeur, historical context and political brass, ""Kingdom"" is no more compelling a period drama than last year's ""Alexander."""
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,What sucks the wind out of the movie's sails is the vacuum at its core.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"A frustratingly thin epic. You're left wanting more exposition, more character development, the tidying up of loose ends."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"One imagined that a movie about the Crusades would be gallant and mad; one feared that it might stoke some antiquated prejudice. But who could have dreamed that it would produce this rambling, hollow show about a boy?"
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"The movie does what any self-respecting politician would do: sidestep the issues, soft-pedal mortal costs, talk a fat game, and divert your attention away from history with exercises in spectacle and power."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,A handful of nifty battle scenes and some decent performances aren't quite enough to make Kingdom memorable.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"Fails to rouse any passion. A potentially great subject is frittered away, though this being a Scott movie, there's style to spare."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,Bottom line: Kingdom of Heaven is the most exciting action-adventure yarn so far this year. Just don't expect anything deeper.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Scott's ravishing visual style, characterized by a fetishistic attention to surface detail and unrelenting beauty, can work wonders with big subjects, but this is also a director who needs actors powerful enough to shoulder narrative and emotional extremes."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Dramatically, even a persuasive supporting cast gets Heaven only so far."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"I'd have a lot more respect for Scott if he were actually the virtuoso he pretends to be. ""Gladiator"" had lousy, disjunctive action, and Kingdom of Heaven is even more maladroit."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Ultimately, despite striving mightily to give everyone a fair shake, the film kindled the ire of conservative Christians and Muslims anyway."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"A mostly lumbering, occasionally rousing epic that walks a bizarre line between historical fact and Hollywood wishful thinking."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,The movie espouses a kind of Unitarian ecumenical egalitarianism that has about as much to do with medieval times as quantum physics. No one should be offended except -- of course -- those who like movies that excite the mind as well as the pulse.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,40,This is muddled and oppressive storytelling (the script is by William Monahan) dotted with elaborate but weightless battle sequences.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,40,To introduce an archetype like this to western audiences -- as the world weathers culturally and religiously demonizing times -- may have been worth this whole flawed movie. Too bad the story didn't just start with him.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,75,"Man on a Ledge doesn't aim high, but what it aims to do, it does. It grabs the audience's attention, engages its anxieties, stokes its resentments and, at the finish, sends people out saying, ""That was good."""
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,70,"Leth moves lightly and briskly, streamlining the weird material into something elemental and true; he's also assembled a knockout supporting cast."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,65,"Either in spite of or because of its whimsically convincing quality, Man on a Ledge is reasonably fun to watch along the way."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,63,"On balance, Man on a Ledge is fun, but I left the theater feeling disappointed and cheated, as if the filmmakers set me up for something great they ultimately couldn't deliver."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,60,"The ending, for instance, is so ridiculously tidy it squeaks. But en route to its kitchen-sink climax, ""Man"" manages to both amuse and provoke, to cleave to convention and promote ideas."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,60,It's fun in a perverse way; the viewer gets to experience a vivid sense of what it feels like to occupy a pigeon-poop smeared piece of stone high in the sky.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,60,"Clichés and thin thrillers are what we can expect from January releases and while Man on a Ledge has predictability to spare, it also has something that makes your time spent worthwhile: legitimate suspense."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"As in the mindless Man on a Ledge, the hero is never really in danger, we're the ones who are trapped."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"As ridiculous as it is, Man on a Ledge isn't a movie that requires suspension of disbelief. It requires the absolute absence of it."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,The film aims for Hitchcock and gets a bit turned around; we're The Audience That Knew Too Much.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"None of it rings true, except perhaps the presence of an ambitious local TV news reporter (Kyra Sedgwick) who begins recording every macabre moment with relish."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"In Man on a Ledge, Leth does well in taking us to dizzying heights. If only he had found a way to ground that thrill in some real pathos as well."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"The supporting players in Man on a Ledge bring more to the party than the leads, and my suspension of disbelief seems to have gotten hung up in traffic while attempting to cross the suspension-of-disbelief bridge from the Brooklyn side."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,The movie cuts back and forth between two preposterous plot lines and uses the man on the ledge as a device to pump up the tension.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,Despite the occasional dumb fun - especially with the heist portions - the leap of logic required to make it all work is enough to leave your brain pancaked on the sidewalk.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"To his credit, director Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil) gets right to the business at hand where the set-up is concerned, but it's in the execution that this would-be thriller falls flat."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,50,"This cloddishly contrived suspenser is too busy to bore, but too farfetched to thrill, combining routine heist-thriller machinations with dialogue that often thuds like a body hitting asphalt."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,42,"Man on a Ledge makes bigger leaps of logic than Nick will if he fails a gravity test. If the transparent sting springing him from Sing Sing doesn't roll your eyes, then wait for the climax when Nick becomes a kind of plainclothes Spider-Man."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"Screenwriter Pablo Fenjves start with a promising premise, and the opening scenes are taut and suspenseful. A late-day chase scene picks up the sagging middle, but Leth totally fumbles what should be the movie's biggest moment."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"Too bad. You sense that someone could have made a good movie with this material. Unfortunately, Leth didn't."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"In the end it's all much ado about not so much, a semifunctional thriller that tingles but never terrifies. Ledge schmedge."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,40,"Trusting an action drone like Worthington to anchor the human drama is a fatal mistake. With him perched on that narrow slab of concrete, it's only a matter of time before the film plummets."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"Man on a Ledge has its diverting moments, but by the time it has reached its too-pat final twist, it turns out to be a title desperately in search of a movie."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"What follows is a jumble of cop- and heist-movie clichés, dotted with appearances by actors you liked in something else."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"More often the film succumbs to clichés, grows convoluted and outlandish, and winds up dead on arrival."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,You could cast this movie with potato chips and still get cheers when one of the bad guys is cuffed. It doesn't matter that none of it is to be believed.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,38,"The script is a hot mess of the highest order, taking some of the stalest chestnuts in the long, venerated legacy of the framed-cop-trying-to-clear-his-name genre and somehow f---ing it up, in scene after scene after scene."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,33,"As the plot unfolds, brick by brick, the structure starts to wobble until it finally collapses into unintentional comedy."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,30,"Worthington wouldn't know how to behave if the film were a comedy; and poor Banks, after a promising, ""Young Adult""–style introduction, isn't allowed to goose the script or push beyond the glass ceiling of her character."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,25,"The shopworn script by Pablo F. Fenjves, who ghost-wrote the unpublished O.J. Simpson book, If I Did It: The Confessions of the Killer, gets no help from director Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil)."
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,25,Man on a Ledge just made me think of an old Van Halen song: Jump.
Man on a Ledge,6.6,18620000,10,Rarely has a film exhibited a bigger disconnect between urban realism and utter ludicrousness.
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,90,"The second Star Trek movie is swift, droll and adventurous, not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. It's everything the first one should have been and wasn't."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,88,"The Wrath of Khan is a top-notch, fast-paced adventure that can be enjoyed equally by fans of the series and those who have never seen an episode."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,88,"Not least among Khan's pleasures is the way it continually veers toward, but never quite crosses, the neutral zone between space opera and interstellar camp. By the end, it becomes simply operatic, with a death scene of surprising emotional power."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,83,This is hands-down the best Trek flick made so far.
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"It's a tale told with considerable warmth and humour, some spiffing explosions and a multiple-hanky act of self-sacrifice to round things off."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"This is one of the most popular in the series, thanks to a high action quotient (including a tensely staged space battle), a suitably campy turn by Montalban, and the shock value of Spock's death. There is some novelty value, too, in the focus on Kirk's family life back on Earth."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"I don't much care if the battles aren't that amazing, because the story doesn't depend on them. It's about a sacrifice made by Spock, and it draws on the sentiment and audience identification developed over the years by the TV series."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,80,"A brisk, handsomely designed film in which its hardware, sturdy as it is, never overwhelms its humanity."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,75,"One leaves the film neither hugely thrilled nor greatly awed, but with a pleasant sense of having caught up with old friends and found them to be just fine, pretty much the way one hoped they would turn out in later life."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,75,"If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically, this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry, but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,70,"For a major sci-fi release in the Star Wars era, it's surprisingly slow and even maudlin."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,7.7,78912963,70,"Foregoing the special effects bonanza of its predecessor, it settles for low camp humanoid melodrama."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,88,"It's a thinking person's thriller, where pyrotechnics give way to plot, character development supplants fight scenes, and adrenaline does not short-circuit intelligence."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,80,"A political thriller with more plausibility -- and yes, more thrills -- than most."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,70,An intramural debate masquerading as an action movie.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,70,"What a shame, therefore, that in its puritanical treatment of the only strong female character, the otherwise politically correct police story is blithely unaware of its own closet misogyny."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,70,"A political film in the form of a thriller, rather than a garden-variety potboiler gleefully helping itself to stock political tropes from the genre's grab bag."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,67,"It's a cautionary tale about the excesses of jingoist paranoia, and the folly of it all is that the more the film descends into somber liberal chest thumping, the less engrossing it becomes."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,63,"The Siege is not a documentary but a glossy Hollywood entertainment that is prey to all the exaggerations, simplifications and acting histrionics that come with the genre."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,63,"In its clumsy way, it throws in comments now and then to show it knows the difference between Arab terrorists and American citizens."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,"If The Siege frustrates anyone, it should be the moviegoers who turn up expecting the kind of clean resolution that action movies thrive on."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,A potentially provocative idea is played out to diminishing returns.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,Edward Zwick's ultimately sedate thriller starts out with crisply efficient style and the potential for a much more involving story.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,60,"The problem, as always, is that when you try to mix cliches with more complicated data it's often the cliches that win out."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"As a nail-biting thriller, The Siege is too confusing, and as a thought-provoking social drama, too confused."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"At some point, the movie itself crosses the line, from a modestly thoughtful attempt to extrapolate a drama from real and urgent events to a generic action piece with predictable good and bad guys and pat, civics-book morals."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"This is a dumb action flick that pretends to have a brain, a spot of affectation that plunges the audience into double jeopardy -- forcing us to traipse through not just the standard litter of bloody corpses but (oh, damn) the added trash of bloodless ideas."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,Zwick frequently sacrifices dramatic urgency in the name of sobriety.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"The good news, then, is that The Siege is hardly the ticking time bomb of racial slurs some would have you imagine, and the bad news is that it doesn't matter because it's all too damn pedantically serious to take seriously."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"Most of the fault rests with the script, which gets to this issue late and feels only perfunctory, more interested in the jolt of the image than the jolt of the idea."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,A sometimes gripping but mostly routine shoot-em-up about Muslim terrorism in American.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"It's one of those fast, slick, half-smart shows that can't decide whether to pay its debts to action or reality -- and winds up cheating both."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"The story is an odd mixture of preachiness and paranoia, but the stars provide sizzling performances and the action moves at a lively clip."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,50,"The filmmakers peddle fear and then try to claim the moral high ground; the treatment is foolish, confused, and borderline irresponsible."
The Siege,6.3,40981289,40,The pre-posterous plot is a far-fetched way to dis-cuss the power and meaning of the Consti-tution in the context of international terror-ism.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,30,This echo of the WWII internment of Japanese-Americans is the only new gimmick in Edward Zwick's entry in the cliche- terrorist genre.
The Siege,6.3,40981289,25,"In an attempt to be complex and fair-minded, a simple story becomes a jumble of confused motivations."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,100,"It doesn't have the dark edge of Joe Dante's other works, but brilliant performances by Martin Short and Meg Ryan make it a joy from start to finish."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,80,"The plot is standard fantasy-adventure pulp, though director Joe Dante (Gremlins, Explorers) has so many screwball things going on in it that the comedy all but overwhelms the formulaic line of action."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,80,"I would have loved to eavesdrop on the script conferences for ""Innerspace."" Here is an absurd, unwieldy, overplotted movie that nevertheless is entertaining - and some of the fun comes from the way the plot keeps laying it on."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,80,"Quaid is engagingly reckless and gung-ho as the pioneer into a new dimension, although he is physically constrained in his little capsule for most of the running time. Short has infinitely more possibilities and makes the most of them, coming into his own as a screen personality as a mild-mannered little guy who rises to an extraordinary situation."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,75,"The film is never inspired; it's not imaginative enough to be any more than an entertainingly good time. But it's an enormously unassuming, likable comedy, and surprisingly uninsistent for a big summer entertainment."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,75,"It takes great confidence to think of a second film before the first is even finished; either that, or it takes great nerve. In any case, Innerspace, which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, has all the brashness of a hit, if not all the luster."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,75,"While the anatomical special effects are imaginative enough, the manic rather than magical tone fails to achieve the sense of awe that made Fantastic Voyage - clearly this film's inspiration - so fascinating."
Innerspace,6.8,25893810,70,"Formulaic fun, helped by two winning leads."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,90,"More important, we should take into account the fact that this is really quite a good movie--a character-driven (as opposed to whammy-driven) suspense drama--dark, fatalistic and, within its melodramatically stretched terms, emotionally plausible."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,90,"Mr. Pitt moves through this unexpectedly solid thriller with dazzling confidence, showing off all the star power that he usually works overtime to hide."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,83,"In this quiet, absorbing, shades-of-gray drama, a kind of thriller meditation on the schism in Northern Ireland, we get the story of not one but two powerfully opposing heroes."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,80,"As a well-directed star vehicle with a couple of good action sequences, this is good, effective filmmaking, but I was periodically bored; when Ford and Pitt aren't lighting up the screen nothing much happens."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,75,That the would-be buddies are played by Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt ensures enough star power to keep things moving even during the sluggish early scenes that set up their relationship.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,70,"The Devil's Own is neither the best nor the worst $90 million-$100 million-area budgeted picture ever made, but it must be the one in which the cost is least evident on the screen."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,70,What makes it worth the price of admission is the energetic performance Ford pulls off in the cookie-cutter role of big-city cop.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,67,"The script, partly written by an uncredited Terry George (""Some Mother's Son,"" ""In the Name of the Father"") strains mightily for insight but never quite breaks through."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,63,The moral reasoning in the film is so confusing that only by completely sidestepping it can the plot work at all.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,63,"Part of the reason The Devil's Own is endurable is because, in spite of various script deficiencies, both of the stars -- Pitt and Harrison Ford -- have an undeniable screen presence. And, while star power can't save a sinking movie, it can at least keep it afloat longer."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,63,The emphasis on character in Rambo scribe Kevin Jarre's screenplay (aided by Vincent Patrick and David Aaron Cohen) gives the film unexpected maturity.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,"Even though The Devil's Own reportedly cost close to $100 million, it comes across as a sleek, medium-grade character study occasionally punctuated by gunfire. If this is what $100 million buys these days, can $200-million movies be very far off?"
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,A topical thriller that manages to be watchable despite director Alan J. Pakula's best efforts to take all the fun out of it.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,"As in all fiercely realistic thrillers, the action becomes less and less credible as it speeds on. But, as with some such thrillers, we tolerate the incredible as the price of the pulse-quickening."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,60,"An earnest, thoughtful, surprisingly well-written (given the number of writers who worked on it) drama about guilt and betrayal that features excellent performances by Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt and dares to defy the juvenile wham bam thank you ma'am aesthetics that have turned mainstream action pictures into feature-length video games."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"Pitt and Ford try to dig deeper, but the script undercuts them with preachy dialogue that might as well read, ""Insert stereotype here."""
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"The dramatic situations aren't intense or knotty enough to match the moral issues behind them, however."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"Hobbled by a schizoid desire to make a deep human drama on the one hand and a blistering IRA shoot-'em-up on the other, Alan Pakula's new movie is less a story than a plodding sequence of debates punctuated by gunfire."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"With two of the world's biggest stars in tow, the creators of The Devil's Own can be forgiven for figuring that nothing else really mattered. If you've got Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, do you really need a coherent script? Unfortunately for everyone concerned, the answer is yes."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,"Certainly, whatever surgery the script doctors performed, it didn't take. The limp result is a picture that is epic in intention and Lilliputian everywhere else."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,50,This movie is only really interesting during the moments of physical conflict that pop up throughout the film. These few scenes are well executed and riveting as hell.
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,40,"The Devil's Own isn't the disaster its bad advance publicity might lead you to expect. But it's a disjointed, sluggish picture."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,40,"The film features plot turns of howling implausibility, leading up to a mechanical climax that resolves the story without forcing either of the principal characters to make the uncommercial decision to blow the other away."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,40,"Ford's earthy Everyman and Pitt's vengeful youth are probably more interesting than they have any right to be inside these tired macho roles. Of course, Rory and Tom could be bursting with blarney and the movie still wouldn't gather any momentum."
The Devil's Own,6.1,42868348,20,"The Devil's Own, which stars Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, is so epically awful, it's practically homeric."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,100,One of the best war movies of the past 20 years.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,88,"""Black Hawk Down"" was criticized because the characters seemed hard to tell apart. We Were Soldiers doesn't have that problem; in the Hollywood tradition it identifies a few key players, casts them with stars, and follows their stories."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,88,"The in-your-face style of We Were Soldiers results in a suspenseful, intense, and exhausting cinematic experience."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,83,"A powerful experience, filled with dazzlingly executed action sequences that generally avoid the rock music and drugged-out conventions of ""Apocalypse Now,"" and even exude a certain core of humanity."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,83,"The film's soldiers are more the mom-and-apple-pie, God-fearing lads of World War II movies than the cynical grunts of ""Platoon"" (1986) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987)."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,You don't really watch the film; you survive it.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"Gibson may get top billing, but it's Sam Elliott who steals all the scenes. As Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley, a man who fires with his own .45 revolver rather than the standard M-16 rifles, he's full of hilariously colorful comments."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"Like the best war movies -- and like martial literature going back to the Iliad -- it balances the dreadful, unassuageable cruelty of warfare and the valor and decency of those who fight."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"It succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides. That might not make it a milestone, but it's a hell of an improvement."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"This is a good film; strong, honest, strikingly photographed (by Dean Semler) and appropriately devastating."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"The writer-director bestows honor -- generously, apolitically -- not only on the dead and still living American veterans who fought in Ia Drang, but also on their families, on their Vietnamese adversaries, and on the families of their adversaries too."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,This also is the rare combat movie that deals substantially with mourning widows on the home front.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,Probably the best thing you can say about We Were Soldiers is that it does justice to an awful conflict.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"Manages to evoke a complex series of reactions. It both frustrates with its unrelenting sentimentality and impresses with the overwhelming physicality of its combat sequences. These in turn are so powerful they take on a life of their own, sending a message that is probably quite opposite to the one the filmmakers intended."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"Isn't a great movie; I'd say it's barely a good one. But it's a war movie that at least acknowledges the distinction between macho and masculinity, always putting the dignity of the latter over the bluster of the former."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"Gibson has the closest thing to a John Wayne part that anyone's played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset, and he plays it damn well."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"It's square, stiff, and in places cheesy; it's also authentically harrowing -- and blood-showered, blood-drowned."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"Soldiers is righteously explicit about the damage artillery does to human flesh, and for its part, it proves relentlessly unpleasant."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"The battle, expertly shot by Dean Semler, captures the chaos of guerrilla warfare paralleled in ""Black Hawk Down"" and gives the film a scarring documentary realism."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"If the action is graphic and immediate, other aspects of the movie are inexcusably bad."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"One admires Wallace's intentions while despairing at his execution. Yet as clumsily directed as his film is, it inspires compassion for Moore, his men and their foes. And in that, there is merit."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,Some scenes achieve dramatic greatness and emotions that reach to the heart's core. Almost as many have the tinny ring of a badly counterfeited coin.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"We Were Soldiers feels strangely irrelevant -- a well-acted, well-crafted and inconsequential visit to woefully familiar territory."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Leaves all the real risks to the young warriors at Ia Drang and collects easy dividends on their bravery. In the end, it honors them by paying tribute to itself."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Fitfully effective as a battle movie, and Mel Gibson does his rugged best to take center stage without seeming to. But the movie is self-righteous in a way that's frequently unseemly."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Though the questionable motives and bad planning of offscreen characters who far outrank Gibson make it difficult to take at face value one soldier's last words -- ""I'm glad I could die for my country"" -- some viewers will, which may be as the filmmakers intended."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,The movie never generates the authority it needs to be all that it can be.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,"Ultimately, though, We Were Soldiers fails to bring as much to the table as it at first seems it might."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,"Who these brave men were and why they fought disappears under the usual clichés, while the astounding acts of courage that occurred at Ia Drang are lost to the dust and din."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,"It was a hellish encounter, as well as a portent of the 10 years to come, and as such deserves far better than Mel Gibson's glower and writer-director Randall Wallace's guns-and-Moses platitudes."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,"It's a shame that the book ""We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young"" fell into the hands of writer-director Randall Wallace (""Braveheart""), a filmmaker who wouldn't recognize subtlety and understatement if they were to attack him in the street."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,Rarely have Gibson's tears seemed more fictional than in this supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment.
Superman II,6.8,108185706,100,"With his perfect pacing, elegant narrative design, and depth of characterization, Richard Lester has made as good a matinee movie as could be imagined: it's a big, generous, beautifully crafted piece of entertainment, with the distinctive Lester touch in the busy backgrounds and the throwaway dialogue."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,100,It brings the fantastic into our everyday lives; it delights in showing us the reaction of the man on the street to Superman's latest stunt.
Superman II,6.8,108185706,100,"It boasts a more consistent tone, better special effects (such as villains throwing buses around like paper planes), and even an affecting love story."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,88,"Superman II delivers on the promise hinted at in ""Superman."" Which is the better film? That's a hard choice to make, since both succeed in different ways."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,88,"Poking fun at its American mythos, but never descending into camp comedy, this sequel makes for a wonderful time."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,88,"A marvelous toy. It's funny, it's full of tricks and it manages to be royally entertaining, which is really all it aims for."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,80,"Superman II emerges as a solid, classy, cannily constructed piece of entertainment which gets down to action almost immediately."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,80,"A stylish, well-paced film with a good variety of moods and moves."
Superman II,6.8,108185706,80,Manages to gain classic comic book feature status through a combination of great stunts and a great human angle.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,75,"Katniss and Tris might still be queen bees of the genre, but Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) and his fellow Gladers find a satisfying, teen-friendly way to combine rebellion, politics, science and a lot of jogging for a broad audience."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,75,"Actually an entertaining action-adventure that not only stands on its own, but surpasses the more limited rewards offered by ""The Maze Runner."""
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,70,Ball and his cast overcome clichés with gusto.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"The Scorch Trials isn’t a particularly good movie, but it’s just fast and nutty enough to keep you entertained."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials does pretty well. It finishes respectably on a scale between “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” (fizzle) and “The Empire Strikes Back” (aces!).
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"The production design and effects for this apocalyptic terrain are way above par for this sort of thing, and evidence of a much higher budget than Ball had first time around."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"Scorch Trials ambitiously opens up its world with mixed results: gripping action, so-so script."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,60,"While it’s a woefully incomplete middle chapter, at least it’s never boring."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,58,"It comes across as unintentionally comic, because Scorch Trials is basically ""Fleeing In Terror: The Movie."" After more than two straight hours of running and screaming, screaming and running, no wonder Thomas is tired. Even marathoners gotta rest sometime."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,The visuals of a blasted city are impressive but hardly reason to spend $10 to sit in a theater seat and watch a bunch of underdeveloped characters get chased by zombies for an inordinate amount of time.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"On a thematic level, it remains wholly reprehensible and a fraudulent piece of entertainment. But at least it rips off some better films (Mad Max, Day of the Dead, The Matrix) with a good deal of energy."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"The movie may feel tonally consistent with the first, but it’s also overlong and thoroughly routine."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"There’s lots of eye candy, and the pace is fast, but somehow the movie falls short. You’re forgiven if you get the idea that “Scorch Trials” suffers from “middle movie” fatigue."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"In Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, selfish oldsters scheme to rob young people of their vital essence, sacrificing them in the process. It’s basically “Social Security: The Movie.”"
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,It’s not a bad movie. It’s like several pretty good ones.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Though Ball's workmanlike handling of the second in the trilogy, ""The Scorch Trials,"" proves mainly that he can keep a franchise from running completely off the rails when the tracks have been laid perilously near a swamp of ""dys-lit"" cliches."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Left without a gimmick, The Scorch Trials wanders between YA cliches — there’s a Resistance, but it’s unclear what they’re resisting — and zombie movie tropes, with the obligatory a zombie bit our friend scene."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Starts at a sprint and hurtles at us for a good long, stretch, before it stops to catch its breath."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"With more action and less mystery, a returning director and main cast and a handful of sketchy new characters, The Scorch Trials makes for an efficient yet uninspiring sequel."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"The Scorch Trials offers virtually no character development and only hints of plot advancement, mostly just functioning to move a group of obliquely motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,42,"Director Wes Ball’s adaptation of the second book in author James Dashner’s popular series is the exact opposite of its predecessor, presenting a sprawling adventure that, when not liberally cribbing from more illustrious sci-fi forefathers, spends plentiful time fleshing out the dull details of its oppressed-youth scenario."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"The Scorch Trials adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre, but it’s at least less ponderous than its predecessor. The many chases and ludicrous narrow escapes offer respectable doses of adrenaline."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"Director Wes Ball's film is a mad dash from one place to the next, with little time in between for rest, recuperation or plot development."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"The second installment, which reveals some of the reasons behind their imprisonment, lacks a similar sense of originality and urgency, undercut by overly familiar characterizations and dilatory pacing."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,38,"Larger than its predecessor, last year’s “The Maze Runner,” in every way: in its cast, scope, set pieces and (unfortunately) length. But “more” also means more convoluted."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,38,"Every set piece brings to mind an Epcot Center attraction built from borrowed parts, geared toward reinforcing the young audience's belief that adults just don't understand them."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,30,"The trouble comes when somebody opens their mouth and you’re reminded this is supremely silly stuff, and overall a much lesser version of teens versus the titans of post-apocalypse industry – a copy of a copy of a copy."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,20,"This film is making a wheezing, spluttering sound: the sound of a profitable YA franchise running out of steam."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,20,"One of the most tedious apocalypses to come down the chute in recent years, this series gets lamer, and lazier, with each entry. The only ‘Trial’ offered by this film is the ordeal of watching it."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,80,"This corny and manipulative movie taxes your ability to suspend disbelief and predictably punishes characters for their hubris--earmarks of a great disaster flick, if the tone is just right."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,70,"While the plot is thin and there's little action till the big blow some 60 minutes into the film, a volcano offers a greater variety of thrills than your basic cyclone ever could."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,70,"Dante's Peak is predictable from start to finish, but the video-game style action and effects never let up long enough for you to remember how absurd it all is. It's a blast."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,63,"Dante's Peak, written by Leslie Bohem and directed by Roger Donaldson, follows the disaster formula so faithfully that if you walk in while the movie is in progress, you can estimate how long the story has to run. That it is skillful is a tribute to the filmmakers."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,63,"Director Roger Donaldson (""Smash Palace,"" ""No Way Out,"" ""Species""), working from a script by Leslie Bohem (""Daylight""),does a serviceable job, wrapping his narrative around the big kabooms, but the real interest comes from the extraordinary barrage of sound and spectacle."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,63,"The special effects are suitably catastrophic, though they aren't much more clever than the computer tricks that turn up in beer commercials these days."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,60,"This is yet another one of those mindlessly enjoyable outings which eschews such unimportant details as plot or characterisation in favour of the biggest, flashiest special effects money can buy. Twister with lava, if you will."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,60,"Writer Leslie Bohem and director Roger Donaldson brush briskly through the standard scientific and romantic blather. They know that in movies like this, complexity is the province of the special-effects people."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,60,"It hardly helps, of course, to have no characters to root for. What is it about Pierce Brosnan? He's got dimples, grace, charm; he's not a movie star, exactly -- he looks as if he should be hosting something."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,58,"""Twister"" is a rush. Dante's Peak, on the other hand, is a bore. Oh, it has its moments, but most of them are concentrated in the final forty-five minutes. The first hour, which is all typical disaster movie setup, is interminable."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,It seems almost beside the point to bring up the notion of plotting and characterization in such an effects-driven film ; nobody's going to rush out to catch Dante's Peak on account of the Shakespearean-caliber thespians involved.
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,"Dante's Peak is customary for the genre, with convincing special effects sharing screen time with standard-issue characters and situations."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,"Physicality of the second half, then, will keep the audience going, but it is not quite sufficient to camouflage the elemental silliness of storyline."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,50,"As boring as the special effects are, they far outshine the stultifying plot."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,30,The special effects are definitely the best thing about this curiously bland disasterthon.
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,30,"These lessons are driven home via silly dialogue (""Her name was Marion and she loved volcanoes..."") and painfully predictable plot complications, repeated often enough that there's no need to take notes, except for the benefit of friends who fall asleep."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,30,"Approximately the last hour of Dante's Peak is made up of action scenes, and how well one likes computer-generated destruction will determine how well one likes the movie."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,25,Dante's Peak expands the concept of badness in movies.
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,25,"The dialogue is utterly inane, but the high-tech effects deliver the sort of thrills that disaster-film connoisseurs expect."
Dante's Peak,5.9,67127760,25,"Too bad that by the time the volcano shoots its wad, the movie has already died a thousand deaths, ground to a halt by the interminable waiting for the damn thing to blow."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,100,"It's a film filled with humor, charm, excitement and so many memorable images that many viewers will find themselves struggling to keep from blinking so as not to miss any of the eye-popping delights crammed into each overstuffed frame."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,80,"Valerian is a film to wallow in, not follow, and if you’re tuned to its extra-terrestrial wavelength, you wouldn’t cut a second."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,80,Valerian is at times so mind-meltingly beautiful and strange that I’m still not sure I didn’t just dream it all.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"This is a movie that will make you scream – in confusion, in delight, in anger, in ecstasy. Sometimes all at once."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,A movie for science fiction fans who wish every minute of “Star Wars” was the cantina scene.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"Are there rules on how to make a space epic? If there are, Luc Besson has certainly never heard them because in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, he takes the genre upside down, gives it a shake and rattle, and delivers one of the most positively bonkers films of the year."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"The difference between the film and its equally expensive contemporaries is Luc Besson's playful, childlike naïveté."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,"As a mogul, Besson doesn’t worry about pleasing his corporate masters. He and his visual effects supervisor, Scott Stokdyk, can expend all their energy on topping themselves and making each other laugh. The movie is like a wave that makes you want to yell, “Cowabunga!”"
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets might well represent the apotheosis of Besson’s singularly loony brand of filmmaking. It’s bonkers and gorgeous and confusing and thrilling and tiring and overflowing with ideas.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,"“Valerian” manages to be both cutting-edge and delightfully old-school — the kind of wild, endlessly creative thrill ride that only the director of “Lucy” and “The Fifth Element” could deliver, constructed as an episodic series of missions, scrapes and near-misses featuring a mind-blowing array of environments and stunning computer-generated alien characters."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,68,"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets showcases plenty of cool creatures and ideas for sci-fi fans to savor, but if only the movie's central characters and their relationship were as exciting and interesting as all that impressive eye candy."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,"In building worlds as detailed and vivid as he’s done here, Besson has essentially allowed the setting to do what’s typically reserved for characters and stakes, and that’s to make us care."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,"The longer action scenes may not always rank with Besson’s early ’90s highlights (Léon: The Professional, La Femme Nikita) or the mania of the more recent Lucy, but there isn’t a moment in this ludicrous, lushly self-indulgent movie that doesn’t feel like its creator is having the time of his life."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,The first 25 minutes of this movie should be mounted as an installation at the Louvre and played on an infinite loop. Only then can our planet know peace.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"In the end, Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a mixed bag: a ripe visual adventure of limitless imagination hamstrung by an undercooked plot propelled by lackluster heroes."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"On a purely visual level, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets deserves mention among the most technically accomplished works of those three. But as a complete motion picture experience, it falls considerably short."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"In short, Besson builds a dazzling alterna-universe — a bit of Terry Gilliam, a dash of “Blade Runner,” a smidgen of “Star Wars” (which, to be fair, was probably influenced by the original comic), and a lot of extra-strength Besson-ian whimsy. And then he strands us with the two least interesting people there."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a luxurious, appealingly daffy spectacle, a true vision unchecked by the standards of good taste, and that in and of itself is a quality worth savoring. But its design is pixel-deep, without the underlying thought that makes great science fiction worth revisiting."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"Besson, an industrial-strength entertainer and the reigning maximalist of the European film industry, isn’t selling originality so much as volume. He has made a madly overstuffed Mos Eisley Cantina of a movie, one that surveys its diverse alien constituencies with the wide-eyed wonderment of a small child and the attention span to boot."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"This is welcome summer fare; if we’re going to have space operas, let them sing in the strangest accents possible."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"The latest from the French filmmaker is a dazzling feast of spectacular visuals and exhilarating set pieces. It’s Besson’s most ambitious film to date, and the most original big-budget adventure you’ll see on screen this season. But such ambition doesn’t always come without flaws."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,55,"Valerian isn’t a movie about plot, characters, or action; it’s a movie about places. True to its comic book roots, the larger arc exists to draw viewers into the beautiful, far-flung corners of Alpha. This makes it strangely episodic for a film, but also refreshingly light on complicated lore."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,Seldom has such a glittering wagon been hitched to such dull stars.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,Valerian has some cool visuals. But there’s more to science fiction than pretty pictures.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,It's as gorgeous as anything the French filmmaker has made and as empty as a Trump tweet.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"The story is ridiculous, the digressions many, but it’s all intended to be part of the fun. Like Besson’s ""The Fifth Element,"" we’re mainly meant to enjoy the sensation of watching wacky green-screen worlds unfold before us."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Besson's commercial instincts for sleek, violent fantasy are often sound, but ""Valerian"" is more sedative than show."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"At its best, it hits the gut with the free-fall feel of a theme-park ride. But it’s a long and winding path back to the gate, and “Valerian” loses its way many times, however beautifully."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,The result is a visually fantastic but sometimes exasperating entertainment that (once again) gets lost in its own chaos. It’s one funned-up spectacle of a movie.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Workshop the story, script-doctor the dialogue and recast the lovely leads with actors who generate a little actual sexual heat and Besson might have had another “Fifth Element,” a minor classic on his hands."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Twenty years after The Fifth Element, writer-director Luc Besson has once again delivered a widescreen, sci-fi spectacle full of rampant whimsy, lavish effects and creaky social commentary, resulting in a nervy, go-for-broke opus whose audacity is more laudable than its execution."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Even if the movie is based on an existing property, a beloved French graphic novel, as a producer and designer, Besson should be lauded; ‘Valerian’ is out of this world. But next time, he might want to reread the comic for its characters, checking the little word bubbles to see if there’s actually something there."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,48,Valerian wants to be weird and sexy but just won’t let itself.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,42,"During the film’s intoxicating first 30 minutes, for example, I couldn’t decide whether what I was watching was brilliantly bonkers or total folly. Then, as the story went on, it came into sharper and sharper focus: Valerian is an epic mess."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"There is no soul, and no heart to the story. A good sci-fi is never merely about the effects, it's about the plot, character and thoughts they bring to life, all of which Valerian lacks in abundance."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"A wildly ambitious space opera, but also a self-indulgent narrative morass. Sometimes, it seems, creativity can benefit from a few limitations."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of “The Phantom Menace” into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets is a fantasy adventure that’s nowhere near as adventurous or fantastical as it should be.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"It never stops for a minute, yet it never goes anywhere. And much as it promises to take you to a thousand planets, it can’t find one sign of intelligent life."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,38,"Sure, the pricey special effects are impressive to behold (though, as usually the case, the 3D is nothing to text home about). And yes, at times “Valerian” creates a strange and beautiful universe. Which ultimately means nothing, because the plot is paper-thin."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,37,"""Valerian” is an expensive, handsome but dozy invalid of a movie."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,Valerian displays reckless imagination and zero personality.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,"If you’re going to call your sci-fi movie Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, you’d better be sure Valerian (Dane DeHaan) is a guy your audience can get behind. Director Luc Besson styles him as a cocky space rogue, but Valerian is weak sauce. And so is this movie."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,There is absolutely nothing new under the many suns in Besson’s universe. This is a voyage not worth taking.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,20,At no point along the way does the film provide a reason to invest your interest in any of this.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,75,"It's a bewildering mix of very smart and very dumb, but the cast, which also features a hilarious Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, Dan Aykroyd as the Cheney-esque ex-vice president, and Hilary Duff as a Turaqistan airhead pop star, is tiptop."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,70,"Like so many satires in the Strangelove mold, this never comes close to working as a story, but its lampoon of U.S. imperialism and military privatization is so bracingly obnoxious I didn't really care."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,67,"Comes up with some decent jokes, including a talking car-based GPS system which doubles as a therapist, and a suggestive Yonica number titled ""I Want to Blow You Up,"" but fails to surround them with a compelling story or characters who rise above the level of cliche."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,63,"Screwball, vaguely futuristic political satires are a rare hybrid, and War, Inc. is an intriguing, if flawed, example."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,63,"This script bumps along, good ideas jostling with weak, derivative ones, and Seftel doesn't seem to know which way he wants to handle the material. Also, with Cusack playing yet another soul-fried wiseacre running on emotional autopilot, the piece doesn't have much of an engine."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,60,"Somehow, what starts as a series of cheap shots in a barrel develops into something more, thanks largely to warm, engaging performances by Cusack and Tomei. War, Inc. is both right-on and somehow off, but it gets points for trying."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,50,"The trouble with this satirical take US involvement in Iraq, penned by Mark Leyner, John Cusack and Jeremy Pikser, is that the real thing is equally absurd and only marginally less funny."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,50,"Its comedy too often blunders into meaningless slapstick, with bombs and bloodshed replacing pratfalls and pies in the face."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,50,A brave and ambitious but chaotic attempt at political satire.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"The ambitions and intentions of War, Inc., co-written by and starring John Cusack, are laudable, but the film is a nearly complete misfire."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"A blackly comic take on the first totally outsourced war? We're too close to being in one right now, which makes this John Cusack vehicle too close for comfort. It's also so close to being funny you can just about taste it -- just about."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"Antiwar, anti-Bush, anti-corporate, yet neither as progressive nor half as funny as the ""Harold and Kumar"" sequel, War, Inc. squanders some top-tier talent (Marisa Tomei, Sir Ben Kingsley) as well as our patience."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,40,"Has TOO much happening, which befits a comedy with a lot of targets but ultimately makes the whole operation scattershot."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,38,All that's missing is coherence. Call it Blunderbuss Satire.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,30,"War, Inc. is gonzo moviemaking with a bleeding heart. A satirical farce that wants to be ""Dr. Strangelove"" for the age of terrorism, it is a zany, nihilistic free-for-all that goes soft."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,30,"War, Inc. is neither all that interesting nor all that cool."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,30,"A film that, in attempting to ridicule the Bush administration, finally just settles for being ridiculous itself."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,25,"The overall experience is manic, juvenile, and hit-or-miss, as if the auteurs behind ""Epic Movie"" were trying to remake ""Wag The Dog."" It's too soon to laugh about Iraq, and it'll never be time to laugh about it with this kind of maladroit humor."
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,25,Misfires so severely that even the clever details get obliterated in the resulting mess.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,20,Sorry excuse for political satire.
"War, Inc.",5.7,580862,12,"The movie has two modes - very loud and extremely loud - and all of the actors are encouraged to mug their hearts out. That even includes Cusack's real-life sister Joan, normally one of the most reliable performers in the business."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,75,"The battle scenes in Rambo III are explosive, conflagratory tableaux that make for wrenching, frequently terrifying viewing. Always at ground zero in the chaos is Rambo - gloriously, inhumanly impervious to fear and danger - whose character is inhabited by Stallone with messianic intensity."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,70,"Rambo's self-important, weight-of-the-world manner and his taste for political posturing would make him genuinely silly were they not counterbalanced by Mr. Stallone's startling, energetic physical presence and the film's stabs at self-mocking humor."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,70,Strays slightly from the formula and therefore loses some of its mindless fun credentials.
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,63,"Though less offensive than its predecessor, Rambo III -- which is dedicated to ""the gallant people of Afghanistan"" -- is still a mindless and uninspired effort."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,50,"Once again, John Rambo guns amok in the name of American democracy, but he packs less dramatic firepower than last time. Rambo III, a poorly paced, much less involving show of guns and machismo, makes you miss ""Rambo II"" (okay, ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"")."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,40,"As you might expect, the calculations here are on a much less sophisticated level. And by less sophisticated, I mean like counting on fingers."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,60,"Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from videogames, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular heroine (Kristin Kreuk), whose original incarnation, legend has it, was among the first distaff figures controllable by joystick."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,60,"Reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle’s photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam’s action choreography unusually witty."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,30,"Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (""Romeo Must Die"") works hard to supply the appropriate grittiness, but other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,30,A wholly inept action experience that works at boring us to tears.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,25,"There's something special about this underwhelming mess of a Street Fighter reboot that many cinematic cheese-lovers will find very appetizing. The fact is that The Legend of Chun-Li is not at all a good flick, but it's filled with so much cornball ineptitude that one would think some rather broken mad movie genius was behind it."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,25,"This is a movie for the overcaffeinated, undereducated teenager in all of us."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,20,Idiot plotting and dialogue are what you'd expect from a genre that typically rewards narrative development with a skip function. But the rote fight scenes are a disappointment.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,20,"Even with the low expectations The Legend of Chun Li engenders, it still somehow manages to be a letdown."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,16,Don't be fooled by the low grade: This sequel-in-spirit to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 dud doesn't even succeed in being memorably bad.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,0,"The problems with Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li began with the casting of dead-eyed, sleepy-voiced, charisma-impaired automaton Kristin Kreuk."
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li,3.7,8742261,0,It boggles the mind that The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is.
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Mad Max has always radiated an otherworldly vibe, a slightly sickly sensation that something at its core is fundamentally wrong."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Miller's work has been compared to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, but where the Leone films are about amorality, the Mad Max movies are purely and simply amoral—some of the most determinedly formalist filmmaking this side of Michael Snow."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Simple, but effective."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"With his instinct and craft, Miller has provided more autosuggestive violence on a $1 million budget than The Blues Brothers did with half the Chicago police force and $30 million."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"The tone sometimes wavers into self-parody, and there are occasional crude patches, but overall this edge-of-seat revenge movie marks the most exciting debut from an Australian director since Peter Weir."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"It's pretty much assumed throughout art and literature that the collapse of civilization will result in the rise of barbarism. That assumption underlies Mad Max, where the strong prey on the weak, and Max steps in to be the equalizer."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"Though the plot is that of a simple revenge western, director George Miller infuses the film with a kinetic combination of visual style, amazing stunt work, creative costume design, and eccentric, detailed characterizations that practically jump out of the screen and grab the viewer by the throat."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"The film belongs to the director, cameraman and stunt artists: it’s not an actor’s piece, though the leads are all effective."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"Less pretentious and more gripping than the overrated sequel, ''The Road Warrior,'' but viciously violent and awfully shallow."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,70,"The chase scenes are top notch. Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of slow parts as well. Another bizarre aspect of Mad Max is that the voices were re-dubbed. Director George Miller, decided that the American public wouldn't be able to understand the Australian accents. It's not as bad as it sounds, but it's definitely a noticeable annoyance."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,75,"It's highly inventive, self-conscious camp, made in 1965, well before the genre wore itself out in superciliousness."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,75,"While many of the jokes don't pay off, it's still funny enough to merit your attention. Mancini's score adds pace and flow. This spectacle is almost totally uncontrolled, and therein lies much of its charm."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,70,"The Great Race is a big, expensive, whopping, comedy extravaganza [from a screen story by Blake Edwards and Arthur Ross], long on slapstick and near-inspired tomfoolery whose tongue-in-cheek treatment liberally sprinkled with corn frequently garners belly laughs."
The Great Race,7.3,25333333,70,"Natalie Wood is on hand as a cheroot-smoking suffragist (with a phenomenal wardrobe), but the movie is largely powered by Lemmon’s energy, roaring like Jackie Gleason as the bombastic Professor Fate and later appearing as his double, the klutzy crown prince of a Ruritanian kingdom."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Handsome, passionate and fun. It's everything we go to the movies for."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"This is a great movie, but it needs a sales job because it's in Mandarin."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Soaring and romantic, wild and serene, feminist and gutsy, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best movies of the year."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Transcends its origins and becomes one of a kind. It's glorious, unashamed escapism and surprisingly touching at the same time."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"The landscapes are so gorgeous, the philosophy so richly appealing, the narrative so epically sweeping, and the characters so intense."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,This is a waking dream of truly operatic dimensions.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The class act of action movies.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Brilliance of the action and effects are supplemented by a consistently superior and resourceful score by Tan Dun.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The picture is more fun than it has a right to be.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,My first viewing left me dazzled but slightly confused; a second deeply impressed; a third rhapsodic. I wish I hadn't needed to rediagram it in my head to turn it into the masterpiece it so obviously wants to be.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Crouching Tiger's blend of the magical, the mythical and the romantic fills a need in us we might not even realize we had."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The first Ang Lee film I've seen that I've liked without qualification.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Magnificently nonchalant about its magic.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Has the sprawling canvas of an epic and the emotional heat of classical melodrama.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"A masterful synthesis of generic conventions and creative imagination, a sublime amalgam of some of the best tendencies and talent our times have to offer."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The film satisfies on both visceral and emotional levels.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,Crouching Tiger's dramatic line is so blurry that the central character is only a bystander to the climactic fight between forces of good and evil.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"There's so much dreamy beauty in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that it's almost like a narcotic."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"What about Ronny Yu's 1992 masterpiece ""The Bride With White Hair,"" of which Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a decent facsimile?"
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"The film may be too talky for action-minded viewers and too fantastic for more serious spectators, but it brings appealing twists - including a feminist sensibility - to the venerable martial-arts genre."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,50,"As a thriller it has its moments, as a romance it's sometimes touching, but as a comedy it's too often a bust."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,50,"The basic mistake in the movie isn't in the pacing, but in the storytelling. They've made the movie about its less interesting major character."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,40,"Gotcha is a hopelessly shallow film, serving up a good deal of hokum in the ridiculous plot. It's a contrived idea to start with, and the script goes through predictable twist after twist until the inevitable conclusion."
Gotcha!,6.2,10806919,30,Gotcha is about as devoid of personality as it's possible for a narrative movie to be.
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,88,"Man on Fire, with a best-ever Denzel Washington, is the first (nonreligious) sure thing to hit the multiplex this year."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,80,By no means perfect - a twist in the tale overextends its already lengthy running time - but it is terrific fun.
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"For what Man on Fire delivers, it's worth enduring Scott's hyperkinetic visual techniques."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"It's resolutely grim and rather predictable but very compelling, and it offers a commanding star vehicle for Denzel Washington."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"The dead-serious Man on Fire awakens a genuine sense of bloodlust in the viewer. This is a slick, big-budget, A-list production designed to stoke our basest impulses -- to make us long for, and cheer at, bloody, merciless vengeance."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,70,"No one rises above the material, though, except for Walken, who looks pleased with the paycheck and the top-shelf tequila. As a shady lawyer, Mickey Rourke is smooth and funny, but recognizable only by his familiar purr."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,70,"Washington's stoic persona here conceals a volcanic rage, and the cast of pros--including Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and Rachel Ticotin--support him with relish."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,67,"Ultimately more bleak and furious than most Hollywood tales of this sort. Man on Fire plays it out to the bloody end, like theres no fire extinguisher in Mexico but for the oceans that hold its borders."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Man on Fire, which starts off as a good example of super-glitz moviemaking, gradually turns into a movie on fire -- another helter-skelter, big-studio spending spree. Too bad. It could use a lot more of Walken, Fanning and some more honest drama."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Not too many R-rated revenge pics depend on ""Uptown Girls'"" Dakota Fanning for the stronger scenes. Yet once the 10-year-old star exits the picture, Man on Fire starts blowing a lot of smoke."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Employs superb craftsmanship and a powerful Denzel Washington performance in an attempt to elevate genre material above its natural level, but it fails. The underlying story isn't worth the effort."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"The film is always watchable, and the confrontations contain undeniable edgy excitement. But even if this weren't a remake, it would be a remake. Hollywood filmmakers have fished these waters so thoroughly that it's virtually impossible to land a big catch."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"One of the more absorbing and palatable entries in the rather disreputable ""Death Wish""-style self-appointed vigilante sub-genre."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"The film as a whole, while possessing a kind of vicious beauty, feels as cold and as embalmed as a corpse."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"Intentional or not, Man on Fire's over-the-top evocation of Christian retribution goes a long way to making this otherwise standard revenge fantasy watchable."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"That there's moral ambiguity to his actions represents some sort of step up from the cinematic norm. Alas, Christopher Walken has very little to do as Creasy's best buddy."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Where Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" radiates freshness and vigor, Man on Fire feels vaguely like something left over from the 1980s, when action heroes were one-note tough guys methodically picking off baddies."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Scott swaddles this fundamentally straightforward revenge story in a jumble of bleary freeze frames, random changes of color saturation and film stock, jump cuts and stuttering montages, splashing text from some menacing word soup onto the resulting collage of chicly disturbing images."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Despite its high craft level and Washington's participation in it, this movie's showy violence is finally as deadening as the over-emphatic violence in these kinds of films generally is."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"A schizophrenic outing from habitually hysterical director Tony Scott (True Romance, The Fan), Man on Fire is a movie of two unreconcilable halves."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"The first hour is sharply directed, character-driven drama that ranks with Scott's best work. Then he lapses into his usual mode - more a bombardier than an entertainer, filling the screen with sadistic violence and arbitrary plot twists. In all, a wasted opportunity."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"It is a good hour too long, although it does boast Christopher Walken."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Seriously, someone needs to stage an intervention, sit Scott down, and tell him that repeated jump cuts, slow-motion shots, and fiddling around with the exposure dont enhance the viewing experience."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Scott apparently decided it was a good idea for his subtitles -- much of the film is in Spanish -- to shimmy across the screen, to fade in and out dramatically, and in general do even more to distract us."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"If your idea of a bargain is two bad movies for the price of one, then shell out for Man on Fire. And don't fret about that incendiary title because this thing is all fuse."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Whenever the movie's point of view turns omniscient, and we're seeing events from the director's vantage point, Man on Fire becomes a blurry, shaky mess."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"On the plus side, the casting is superb - and the acting, too. Although the context is overwrought and the moviemaking over-the-top, Washington acts from the ticker out."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,40,"Scott's latest exercise in assaultive excess nevertheless lingers for two and a half hours, like a drunken houseguest who won't leave."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,38,"Man on Fire is as ludicrous as ""John Q,"" ""Virtuosity"" and ""Out of Time,"" yet substantially more violent, artificial, self-conscious and dull."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"This is a time-tested movie con, but rarely has it been deployed so contemptibly."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"This movie is a predictable, gruesome piece of business."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"The movie's mortal failing is echoed in the religious medal Pita gives Creasy in a gift of innocent, uplifting love: Finding heft or coherence within all the lugubrious agitation is a lost cause worthy of St. Jude."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,25,"Not even within earshot of a masterpiece, Man on Fire, based on its ratio of production costs to quality alone, may prove to be the worst movie of 2004."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,25,"Man on Fire is ponderous and bloated, dragging the Bible and Giannini into its swirling cesspool. Scott can't give the movie any real emotional weight. And Washington gives his first lifeless performance."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,12,"It's dispiriting to see good actors doing smart, solid work with so much unadulterated garbage swirling around them. Scott's art is also death, and we, the audience, are the ones he's jabbing at with his ruthless paintbrush. It's about time someone told him where to stick it."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"Timothy Dalton's monogamous, deadpan 007 brings a more nuanced interpretation to the central character, whose relationships evolve in ways rarely seen in the earlier films."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"Confused plot and digressive globe trotting notwithstanding, the best Bond in years."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"007's latest, The Living Daylights, a snazzy spy thriller, is all the more alluring for its new conservatism. It's right up there with the early Bonds, though not in the league with Goldfinger. But oh, what a difference."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,80,"You may not like Timothy Dalton as Bond, but the fact is they could put a trained seal in the role and the movies would be basically the same. And by those standards, this one is pretty good."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,75,"Director John Glen is an old hand at James Bond films, having worked on three other 007 movies. He knows this popular spy well and does him great service in this well-paced film."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,75,"In The Living Daylights, Dalton establishes his claim to the role; in the films that will follow, he'll have the chance to dig deeper."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,"Mr. Dalton, the latest successor to the role of James Bond, is well equipped for his new responsibilities."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,"With a hint of that my-way problem-solving approach, The Living Daylights freshens the Bond series’ cornball formula elements while reprising details that had made director John Glen’s debut, For Your Eyes Only, such a superior outing."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,Dalton shows a serious side that's been missing from the role since Sean Connery's earliest 007 days.
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,70,"After the fizzle of the later Roger Moore Bonds, The Living Daylights brings in a new 007 in Timothy Dalton, who manages the Connery trick of seeming suave and tough at the same time, and tried to get away from the weak comedy in favour of proper international intrigue."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,60,"Dalton has training in classical theater; he has pedigree, looks, class. But as Bond he is – face it – dull as dirt. Too much spoofing is bad (see Moore), none is deadly (see Dalton)."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"I'll be among the first to admit that Timothy Dalton is a fine actor. But giving a solid performance has little to do with being a good James Bond, and, as accomplished as Dalton is, he's a failure as 007 in The Living Daylights."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"Timothy Dalton stars as the 1987 model James Bond in this 15th entry in the series, with the usual assortment of dope smugglers, KGB operatives, and criminal psychos providing a few anxious moments at the welcoming party. Expect the expected."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"Without a great Bond girl, a great villain or a hero with a sense of humor, The Living Daylights belongs somewhere on the lower rungs of the Bond ladder. But there are some nice stunts."
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,50,"Bond is impersonated by 007 newcomer Timothy Dalton, who does little that's identifiable as acting, although he looks the part. Come back, Sean, all is forgiven!"
The Living Daylights,6.7,51185897,42,"I feel just rotten about this, but I'm afraid I've outgrown James."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,67,"In its low grade way, this blithely brutal cops and drugs thriller is an efficient hot wire entertainment."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,60,"Silver, manages the deft balance of making Seagal seem both genuinely courageous and charmingly blockheaded."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,50,"In Seagal's movies, the interesting stuff never derives from what happens, but rather from how it happens. Exit Wounds is certainly one of his best efforts, although the distinction is a dubious one at best."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,50,"It's a pastiche of pulpy elements culled from all the ""Dirty Harry"" movies you can think of."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,40,"The small reward is the cool, confident presence of DMX, who shows signs of being a great leading man. But only in a much smarter, more original movie."
Exit Wounds,5.6,51758599,38,"Viewers who sit through Exit Wounds should at least do themselves the favor of staying for the end credits, which feature some truly funny off-color banter between Anderson and Arnold on the latter's ostensible talkshow."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,100,"As challenging as it must have been to pilot Joss Whedon's space opera from the TV junk pile to the big screen, the finished product is a triumph."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,91,"If you think the ""Star Wars"" prequels are a disease, then Serenity is the cure."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,90,"This is a film that exists because of fans, was written for the fans and yet can be enjoyed by just about anyone willing to have a good time."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,90,Serenity is a trim little picture of epic proportions.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,88,"A brash, funny, action-packed bit of sci-fi ecstasy--and a giant raspberry to the execs who let ""Firefly"" fall out of the sky."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,88,"Whedon wants to make a Serenity trilogy, and I suspect the actors will grow on me if he does. In this case, familiarity would breed not contempt but comfort."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"Serenity is still taut, immersive, and alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, a well-balanced blend of whooping Wild West action and space opera."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"It's but a witty, engaging hodgepodge of archetypes and clichés; it retreads not only the TV show's story lines, but also those of every ""Star Trek"" and ""Gunsmoke"" episode. It needed the room of a big screen just to fit all of its influences into a single place."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,A highly entertaining piece of genre-blending fun.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"No matter what's coming their way, post-apocalyptic doom or gloom, this James Gang of the galaxy is just plain fun to watch."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"A sci-fi saga that manages to be at once stirring and screwball, gut-busting and gut-wrenching, and more fun than you had at any bigger-budget movie this past summer."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"If you're a novice, this is a plucky introduction to Whedon's world and the most fun sci-fi of the year. If you're a devotee, this is the magnificent return you've been praying for."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,78,"Serenity evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original ""Star Wars"" films, a love that was mightily tested by George Lucas' humorless prequels."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Jaw set but never stiff, he (Fillion) gets both the Whedon wit and the Whedon grandiloquence between cheek and gum, and gives the whole enterprise the heft of a real saga."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity is made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity shows what might have happened if Han Solo had been the focus of the original ""Star Wars"" instead of whiny Jedi wannabe Luke Skywalker."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Although Mal is ostensibly the movie's hero, and River its heroine, Whedon does a good job of giving all onboard their own story arc, their tragedies and triumphs. The cast, to a man (and woman), is solid, although it's the ballet-trained Glau, who gets to mope in high angst and go Zhang Ziyi-crazy in a couple of martial-arts scenes, who steals the show."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"The film's strength is compelling character relationships and Whedon's trademark dialogue, a smarter version of the cliched action-movie barrage of wisecrack under fire, only better executed, laden in personality, and enriched with evocative western colloquialisms of a frontier culture."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"It features truly monstrous bogeymen in the Reavers, cannibalistic renegades who, legend has it, went to the edge of the universe and were driven mad by the abyss."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity may be short on exposition, but it's smart and fun."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"While it's a geek's paradise from scene one, newcomers are likely to feel left out until they get their bearings.  Fortunately, Whedon's characteristic humanity, coupled with the slyest sense of humor in Hollywood, greatly eases the transition."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"After witnessing the wearying parliamentary debates among good and bad senators in recent Star Wars episodes, it's a pleasure to watch a sci-fi movie where more than just the spaceships move quickly."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"A fast-paced, engaging science fiction adventure tale."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity may not be the next ""Star Wars,"" but it's the best we've seen since the original trilogy, and if Wheedon is planning Serenity trilogy (the door is left open), it would certainly be welcome."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"What makes Serenity refreshing is its avoidance of CGI, which gives the pic a much more human dimension; the evident chemistry between the cast; and a humor that doesn't rely simply on flip one-liners."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Though richly allegorical, Serenity also works as a rousing and unabashedly manipulative adventure that never takes itself too seriously."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Scene for scene, Serenity is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"An appealingly low-rent, if not earth-shattering, 26th century ""Star Wars"" with faint glimmers of ""Blade Runner,"" ""Buckaroo Banzai"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for good measure."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Chiwetel Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things) is the sinister operative dispatched to retrieve the ship's psychic passenger, who as played by Summer Glau kickboxes better than Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi combined."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,I mean Serenity no disrespect when I say it's enjoyably junky.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,63,"For folks like me, who missed ""Firefly,"" the short-lived TV show on which the movie's based, watching Serenity is like showing up for a big lecture course at the end of the semester. And yet, after an hour of intense disorientation, the movie's arch sarcasm becomes oddly entertaining."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"It's the zippy chatter among the Serenity's wised-up space pirates that gives the film most of its punch, but with only serviceable action sequences and largely cookie-cutter effects, you can still sense the void just outside."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"The dialogue, delivered mostly in Southern accents, is intended to be funny and fresh, but much of this Western-influenced sci-fi adventure story feels reheated."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"If you can't be original, why not borrow from something no one has seen, like Ben Affleck's last five movies?"
1941,5.8,31755742,70,"Billed as a comedy spectacle, Steven Spielberg’s 1941 is long on spectacle, but short on comedy. The Universal-Columbia Pictures co-production is an exceedingly entertaining, fast-moving revision of 1940s war hysteria in Los Angeles spawned by the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and boasts Hollywood’s finest miniature and special effects work seen to date."
1941,5.8,31755742,50,"1941 is loaded with slam-bang sight gags and action, but comedy isn't director Steven Spielberg's forte and the movie isn't nearly as funny as it might have been."
1941,5.8,31755742,40,"1941 is less comic than cumbersome, as much fun as a 40-pound wrist-watch."
1941,5.8,31755742,40,"It's not fair to say Steven Spielberg's 1941 lacks ""pacing."" It's got it, all right, but all at the same pace: The movie relentlessly throws gags at us until we're dizzy. It's an attempt at that most tricky of genres, the blockbuster comedy, and it tries so hard to dazzle us that we want a break."
Postal,4.5,18005198,60,It's such an insanely fun ride that most of its flaws are forgivable.
Postal,4.5,18005198,50,"Not only less than horrible, but actually occasionally enjoyable."
Postal,4.5,18005198,42,"A provocation first, an insult second, a publicity stunt third, and a film a distant fourth."
Postal,4.5,18005198,40,This anything-goes exercise isn't dull -- one just wishes the outrageousness were more consistently funny.
Postal,4.5,18005198,38,"Postal's touches of wit are lost in the flying body parts, gross-out gags, and the full frontal spectacle of Foley's no-longer-private parts."
Postal,4.5,18005198,25,What Boll gives us is a boring beating over the head.
Postal,4.5,18005198,25,At last: Uwe Boll has made his first intentionally funny film.
Postal,4.5,18005198,20,"Manages to be as toothless as he (Boll) is tasteless. Poorly framed, tone-deaf, and nonsensical (yet still Boll's best!)."
Postal,4.5,18005198,10,"Infantile, irreverent and boorish to the max, Postal explodes with bad attitude and lousy filmmaking."
Postal,4.5,18005198,10,"Boll's rampant narcissistic showmanship creates such a bizarre, garish spectacle that it is almost tempting to give him credit for being something of a misunderstood artist after all. Almost, but not quite."
Postal,4.5,18005198,0,"Where Boll's movies were once amusingly atrocious, Postal is so aggressively tasteless and knowingly idiotic, there's just no fun to be had."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,100,"A tense, concise and elegantly shot film."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,88,"The movie's excellence comes from Foster's performance as a resourceful and brave woman; from Bean, Sarsgaard and the members of the cabin crew, all with varying degrees of doubt; from the screenplay by Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray; and from the direction by Robert Schwentke."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,88,"For at least two-thirds of its length, all elements combine for a taut thriller, a Hitchcockian exercise in suspense pitting human frailty - can our minds be trusted? - against human resourcefulness."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,83,Far-fetched but deliciously exciting aerial nail-biter.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,70,"Until those final moments, Flightplan succeeds admirably, both as a sophisticated psychological thriller and as an example of, if not great art, then superb craftsmanship."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,70,"Has a routine finish but up to that point is a more than decent thriller--or, given its taut self-containment, a more than decent Hitchcockian ""exercise in suspense."""
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,63,"Jodie Foster's fiercely intelligent performance drives this disappointing thriller, whose taut, carefully constructed first half is sadly negated by its implausible and -- worst of all -- unengaging conclusion."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,63,Doesn't have its heroine's conviction. It'd be better if it had.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,This thriller is effective if you can accept that--as with some of John Dickson Carr's locked-room mysteries--the trickiness counts more than any plausibility.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,"Schwentke handles the claustrophobic environment efficiently enough, though he dallies too long before letting anxiety give way to action."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,Becomes more satisfying than the stock thriller–star vehicle it begins and ends as.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,60,"An enthralling, enjoyable if ultimately far-fetched thriller."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,58,A thriller that goes from pretty good to absolutely ludicrous in the time it takes one actor to recite about four sentences of dialogue.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,58,"Since Foster plays warming-up-for-a-straitjacket panic with a clenched intensity rare to behold in a Hollywood actress, I, for one, was rooting for the radical -- that is, nuthouse -- option."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"But coming on the heels of ""Red Eye,"" which is nothing if not an efficient thrill machine, Flightplan can only look conspicuously flat by comparison."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"A thriller of passive virtues, the steely intensity of Jodie Foster notwithstanding. It's not too violent. It's not assaultive. Even James Horner's music plays it cool."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"Sean Bean makes a positive impression as the caring but puzzled captain of the flight, though Peter Sarsgaard flies at half-mast as a clumsy air marshal."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"Despite excellent elements - great actress, taut plot, slick visuals - Flightplan is like airplane food. No matter how good the ingredients the air chef has to work with, the entree inevitably ends up tasting like a Xerox of a facsimile of a meal."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,The latest motion picture to take an intriguing premise and flush it into the septic tank.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"To watch Ms. Foster storm through a phony airplane for an entire movie has its very minor pleasures - given the numerous close-ups, you can study her lovely face at your leisure - but there is nothing here to feed the head or fray the nerves."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,The movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to Rambo high jinks.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"There is something really nasty about this cold, calculating exercise in mob psychology and human venality."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"This B-list thriller portrays air crews as inept, at best, and callous and cruel at worst."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,Largely undone by a script that self-destructs in the third act of an otherwise well-made thriller.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"The plot is contingent on everything going perfectly in ways no one can possibly predict, right down to the most outlandish happenstance of timing and human behavior."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"By the final act, involving possibly the most far-fetched scheme since Dr. Evil aimed his death ray at Earth in ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" the indifference has become completely contagious."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"I'd like to say that Flightplan is one of those white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat thrill rides that critics are always raving about, but instead, it's more like a transatlantic flight with no clear destination, where the cabin noise makes it impossible to sleep and the in-flight movie is a rerun."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,50,"As it is, Flightplan is half of a pretty good movie. But to maintain that impression, I recommend you take a nap for the last 40 minutes."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,40,Flightplan should have remained grounded for repairs.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,40,"An exercise in edgy tedium, and even though it's only 90 minutes or so, it seems to last longer than an actual transatlantic flight. If you bring an eye mask and a few sleeping pills, you should get through it OK. A magazine or book wouldn't hurt, either. It'll be over before you know it."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,40,"As the movie enters its final chapter, you will come to the sad, sickening realization that the filmmakers have played you for a chump. What seemed so smart, so well crafted and finely tuned, falls apart into a flaming heap of c---, and all goodwill is dashed."
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,38,Absurdity has a new name: Flightplan.
Flightplan,6.3,89707299,25,"This movie demands that the viewer -- and even its own characters -- turn into thumb-sucking 3-year-olds with no need for plausibility or logic, as long as there are lots of flashing lights and whooshing noises emanating from the screen."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,75,"The script by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling gets relaxed, throwaway laughs, even if it doesn’t always hold together."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,63,Pixels is a blast of energetic fun.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,60,"Pixels is a slice of pure, frivolous entertainment that doesn't try to overreach."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"it’s not as original as it wants to be, despite having the able Chris Columbus in the director’s chair."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"The visual effects are impressive, and there is a certain kick to seeing the human characters dodging barrels in a life-size Donkey Kong. But we don’t really care about the humans; here, at least, Q*bert is more endearing than Adam Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"With a novel idea at its center and some good jokes scattered throughout, Pixels is a relief from the self-serious action films that invade movie theaters at this time of year. For most of the way, it’s good enough to enjoy, and for the rest of the way, it’s good enough to root for. But ultimately, it’s not quite good enough ... to be good enough."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"Pixels has a few inspired action sequences and a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, but overall the special effects are surprisingly average — and the lazy acting by Adam Sandler, the shameless mugging by Kevin James and the hammy performance by Brian Cox don’t help. Not even Peter Dinklage in a mullet can save the day."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"Sporting a flowing mullet and aviator shades, Dinklage perks things up considerably as the story’s comically arrogant bad-boy-turned-good-guy."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,42,"Even on its own silly terms, Pixels is not a very good movie; it’s painted up like a Ghostbusters-style fantasy-comedy but plays like so many slapdash Happy Madison productions before it."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"Pixels is a casually sexist, awkwardly structured, bro-centric comedy, starring some of Sandler’s buddies. The only difference this time is that state-of-the-art CGI has been added to the mix."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"If Sandler can’t find it in himself to be verbally or physically entertaining on set, you start to wonder why he’s there in the first place, although his hollow stare in a number of scenes suggests he may be pondering the same thing."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"On this evidence, maybe the eighties weren't so great after all."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,The truly mystifying thing about the movie is how desperately it caters to Gen-X junk nostalgia without bothering to think that maybe those Reagan-era kids have grown up a bit.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"At isolated moments a tolerably amusing send-up of alien invasion disaster movies in which the attackers are video arcade-era renegades arrived to gobble up as many famous landmarks as possible, this one-note comedy runs out of gas within an hour (it is based on a short film) and should have been trimmed to a neat 90 minutes."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,"When one considers how good this material might have been if placed in the right hands, to see it squandered this way makes it almost more painful to view than the typical Sandler stinker."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,Pixels may feel flatter to kids of the ’80s than it does to moviegoers too young to have known Pac-Man from Ant-Man.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,"Long before you’ve gotten a nickel’s worth of entertainment out of this dumb, unfunny flick, you’ll be wishing for the flashing sign that says “Game over.”"
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,"The 3D adds little, and the hallmarks of the Chris Columbus directing style are unevenness and luck. With a little of the latter, this could be a huge hit. But with a better star, sharper script and more Dinklage, it could have been a champ."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,37,"Lazy humor and familiar plotting aside, Pixels at least gets a little mileage out of its affection for the 1980s."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,33,"Neither Sandler nor his listless writers (too many punchlines just sit there and collect flies) seem invested. Whether he’s saving the planet or putting the moves on Michelle Monaghan, Sandler can’t be bothered to raise his pulse above comatose. If he doesn’t care, why should anyone else?"
Pixels,5.6,78747585,33,"Basically it's Ghostbusters meets Wreck-It Ralph, without the sustained charm or wit of either."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,30,"Some movies are so interminable that it seems they might never end, while others are assembled with such indifference that you are essentially left waiting for them to start. Pixels somehow manages both."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,30,"For a movie that’s supposedly about delivering weightless, uncomplicated fun, Pixels is an overwhelmingly sad experience."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,30,"Even though it’s fair to say that Pixels is on steadier ground than most of Sandler’s recent comedies, the film is nevertheless flat-footed and grows tedious after the first hour."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,"The ""characters"" vary from slightly annoying to unbearable - this is a film in which a viewer can be forgiven for rooting for the old video game icons to annihilate humanity. God help us if the best savior we can muster is Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,Yikes! I saw Pixels as a 3D metaphor for Hollywood's digital assault on our eyes and brains. Not funny. Just relentless and exhausting.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,"I think Sandler's miscasting leads to a real deficit of energy at the center of the film, and then the conceptual misfire is so dire that I just don't know what to say beyond that."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,"This is a Happy Madison production, and as such it's exhaustively lazy, outside of its righteous dedication to the valorization of the man-child."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"A movie like Pixels should be stupid and energetic, not stupid and lifeless."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"Here's a shocker: In Pixels, his latest, Adam Sandler plays a stunted man-child who turns out to be very, very special."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"Pixels is ultimately a thoroughly numbing experience, not least because all the characters are doomed by a psychological flatness more two-dimensional than any arcade-game screen."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"Where Sandler once exulted in our outrage (and frequently, our laughter), he now seems barely capable of mustering enough effort to carry a scene, let alone advance to level 255 of “Galaga.” There’s no joy left in his shtick."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,12,"Pixels is a movie without wit, without jokes, with nothing to say but plenty to regurgitate."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,12,It stumbled onto an accomplishment truly awe-inspiring: It makes “Battleship” and “The Watch” look good.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,8,"There are legitimate excuses for going to see Pixels. Losing a bet, perhaps. Having a loved one held for ransom. Maybe a serious blow to the head. But none of those (except maybe the last) would allow you watch and actually enjoy the latest cinematic leavings of Adam Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,0,"As a bad movie, Pixels is extremely dismissible. The ways in which it is bad are hardly fun to pick apart, a la ""The Room;"" instead, they're just banal — the deeply predictable plot, the unfunny jokes, the constant low-level sexism and occasional spikes of racism that permeate the story."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,0,"Every joke is lame, every special effect unspecial."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"Here's a picture that you actually want to see a second time, not for the sake of further wrapping your head around its gnarly conceptual matrix, but because of the sheer visceral charge it provides. Here, at long last, is a summer movie -- like its precursors in the Terminator canon -- worth its weight in cybernetic organisms."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"This movie doesnt cop out. It doesnt go for fake, feel-good warm fuzzies, and its not for the faint of heart. Terminator 3 has guts. It has a LOT of guts. And its a rare thing for any movie  whether its a summer blockbuster or an indie arthouse flick  to have guts."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"T3 delivers the goods. A hard-hitting, straight-ahead sci-fi actioner with none of the pretentions and ponderousness that have put at least a portion of the public off of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk."""
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,88,"The effects in ""T3"" are spectacular, and the action sequences -- particularly the fights between the good and bad terminators -- are exhilarating."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,83,"With him (Schwarzenegger), we return to a franchise we never knew we missed, surprisingly grateful for the star's generosity -- and evident pleasure -- in strapping on the old sunglasses and blasting adversaries to hell."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,80,"An expertly paced and efficient sci-fi thrill machine, ""T3"" effectively marries impressive action sequences with persuasive storytelling and its star's uniquely appealing style of ""No"" drama -- as in no reaction, no expression, no emotion of any kind."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,80,"Tried hard to honor the spirit of the franchise, not exploit it, and take it to a new level and a surprising destination."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,78,"Reality has overtaken the movies here, which, I suppose, makes T3 all the more cathartically appealing. At least onscreen we have Arnold Schwarzenegger in our corner."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"It puts almost everything it has into its explosive set pieces, but manages to instill the audience with just enough emotional involvement. If, Ah-nold decides to come bach again, this installment should ensure he has an audience."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Though this film doesn't have the novelty value of the first or the complex plotting of the second, it boasts the most spectacular single sequence."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Gets the most bang for its buck by letting the camera linger on the spectacle, and allowing tension, not flashiness, to be its hallmark."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"May lack the mythic pow of the 1984 original and the visionary thrill of T2, but it's a potent popcorn movie that digs in its hooks and doesn't let go until an ending that ODs on apocalyptic hoo-ha."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"This is easily the funniest of the Terminator movies (although not, it should be stressed, the lightest). It is also the shortest and most compact."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"In a summer of comic book super-operas dense with psychological torment and sprawling well over two hours, the unpretentious efficiency of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is refreshing."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Against all odds this ""Terminator"" deserves to be welcomed back."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"This third installment is the loudest, dopiest, and least inventive of the three. But what the movie...lacks in intelligence it makes up for in sheer doom."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,Pedestrian but appealing.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"At its screeching, wall-breaking best, T3 achieves heavy-metal slapstick."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"T3, while far from a classic, is an overachieving, mercenary sequel that's short on thrills, but surprisingly long on laughs and surprises."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"Overall it's reasonably thrilling anyway. If you're hoping for a brilliant revisionist take on the franchise, forget it."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"At its metallic heart, T3 is another chase movie -- one figure relentlessly tracking three others, mostly in cars, at high speed through implausibly underpopulated Los Angeles streets."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"Lacks the wonder, surprises and supercool attitude Cameron achieved.  ""T3"" is no weak sister, though. With Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the iconic title character and an often witty, fast-paced script by John Brancato, Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian, audiences worldwide will embrace the new film."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"As an action film it roars forward with agreeable, transporting energy."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"That's not to say Terminator 3 is terminally awful -- just banal, merely humdrum, more conventional horror flick than science-fiction myth, and a whole lot less than what came before."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,67,"Terminator 3 moves at not-quite-breakneck speed, and the shape-shifting, metal-melting special effects aren't exactly spectacular."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,The good news is that Schwarzenegger is more entertaining than ever as the Terminator T-101 cyborg.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,Is Terminator 3 a skillful piece of work? Indeed. Will it entertain the Friday night action crowd? You bet. Does it tease and intrigue us like the earlier films did? Not really.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,"Less about the characters than about the first two movies, whose best scenes it congeals into ritual or parody."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,"I dont mind the movies retro-ness, but I wish Mostow didn't take pulp so seriously."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"Picking up some 10 years after the previous film left off, this stripped-down, intelligently conceived follow-up is a respectable conclusion to the Terminator trilogy."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"Where Judgment Day exhibited the profligate sprawl of a military operation, the leaner, less grandiose Rise of the Machines has the feel of a single Hummer careening through an earthquake in downtown Burbank."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"For all the hype and the inevitable box office bonanza, Terminator 3 is essentially a B movie, content to be loud, dumb and obvious."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"If none of this seems particularly fresh, you're right. ""T3"" is strikingly similar to ""T2"" and ""T,"" reflecting Hollywood's reluctance to tamper with a hit series."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"The villain comes back more times than Wile E. Coyote. I found it tiresome and witless and numbingly repetitive, but action mavens won't feel cheated."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,"Has its moments, and Schwarzenegger is as buff and tough as ever. But there's a flat feeling about this effort that's unmistakable and inescapable."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,"Unfolds as a thrilling piece of entertainment, but it has a third act and ending that dont work and shouldnt ever work."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Begins promisingly and entertains for a stretch because you think it's leading to something more than one of the movie year's flattest conclusions.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Wastes no time getting very loud and very silly and never really lets up.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Pointless and mind-numbing.
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,60,"It's a peculiar kind of humor, but it does play."
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,60,It began a transition in the series away from horror and toward kid-friendly adventure.
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,50,"On the plus side, King Kong Vs. Godzilla had a higher budget than most films, and it shows."
Kingu Kongu tai Gojira,5.9,2725000,20,The one mild surprise of this cheap reprise of earlier Hollywood and Japanese horror films is the ineptitude of its fakery.
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,60,"It’s far from the perfect storm, but The Hurricane Heist is stupid fun with a belter of a final sequence. Like the sound of a film called ‘The Hurricane Heist’? Then you’ll probably enjoy The Hurricane Heist."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,60,"In many ways, The Hurricane Heist’s lack of self-awareness regarding just how dated it feels plays to its advantage. If you’re looking for that 1997 big-budget CG showcase experience without the wink-wink self deprecating irony of The Lonely Island or Deadpool, then you should be fairly satisfied with this cinematic time capsule."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,60,"The delicious silliness of The Hurricane Heist creeps up on you, because the absolutely wild action sequences as Will weaponizes the hurricane happen with very little fanfare or preparation."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,58,A workmanlike cross between a disaster movie and a caper-chase flick...the film never rises to the promise of its awesomely literal title.
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,50,It’s a silly fun action movie where bad guys get sucked out of a mall and everyone’s hair is wet but also perfect and one of the good guys is a meteorologist who went into the field because a hurricane killed his dad in 1992 and he wants to figure out how to “stop” them.
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,50,"Dialogue tends toward the eye-rolling variety and performances feel uneven across the board, with the actors using a menagerie of accents, including some dubious Deep South ones, as they shout above all the pounding rain and thunder."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,40,"Still coasting on once being the director of the first The Fast and the Furious a full 17 years ago, Rob Cohen is unable to muster true engagement with the banal plot and characters, or deliver the kind of inspired ridiculousness that makes for a guilty pleasure."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,30,"The Hurricane Heist is...a perfect storm of deliriously watchable inanity and ineptitude. It may be a strong early candidate for the worst movie of 2018, but don’t let that deter you – bad movies this fun don’t come along every day."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,30,"The Hurricane Heist delivers what it promises on some basic level; it’s got plenty of hurricane, and it’s got plenty of heist. But those looking for Sharknado-style idiocy will probably be disappointed, as will those looking for anything that makes sense. That might be the film’s fundamental problem."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,25,"One of the dumbest variations of the weather-based action thriller subgenre that I have ever seen, you can be rest assured that I know what I am talking about."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,25,"Aside from those random moments, this is an utter excrement storm, from start to finish. And as bad as the acting, nonsensical plot and dialogue are, there’s not a laugh in this thing — intentional or unintentional."
The Hurricane Heist,5.1,6115825,10,"Do not shelter yourself from the silliness of The Hurricane Heist. Put down your umbrella, throw your arms open wide and get soaked with its idiocy."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,80,"Statham isn't an actor who coasts, not even in a recklessly enjoyable picture like Transporter 3. He does the work, so we don't have to: His Frank Martin is the personification of pleasure without guilt."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,75,"The villainous Polluter-in-Chief is eloquently played by Robert Knepper, familiarly loathsome as T-Bag on Fox's ""Prison Break."" And when Knepper and Statham get together, there's a fine showdown of grimaces."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,75,What makes it all work is that Frank remains a self-made hero.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,70,"Overall, the production has the polish and pace that producer/co-writer Luc Besson's work is known for. Any complaints about the lack of substance are pointless."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,70,"The end result is ""Mission: Impossible"" meets ""Speed"": high-tech gizmos, exotic European locales, and hair-raising stunts, many performed by Statham himself, who, when he's not shirtless, looks spiffy in Dior."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,67,"In a series elevated by high-flying ridiculousness, Transporter 3 falls a couple of sequences short of the standard, but it does show off Statham's considerable dirt-biking skills. For that, at least, it's kinda rad."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,63,"Though this third installment is not quite as nuts as the second film, it's nevertheless firmly set in the same ridiculous mold."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,63,A perfectly acceptable brainless action thriller.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,63,"The best sequences involve Frank's inventive ability to stay within 75 feet of his car, but otherwise, it's the charismatic unruffled dexterity in the face of impossible odds that rivets."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,60,"Though the car chases have grown more banal as the franchise has started to run on fumes, the smackdowns have retained their zing."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,58,"As action movies seem to get more complicated and convoluted with international conspiracies and technological concepts, the ""Transporter"" franchise is refreshingly simple."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,"Boasts a measure of the retro machismo, style and attitude some 007 fans have found lacking in ""Quantum of Solace."" But it also has a pointless storyline, incoherent editing and a polyglot cast that renders some of the dialogue utterly incomprehensible."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,Transporter 3 is the most frustrating entry into a series that has never set the bar terribly high.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,Transporter 3 is so far over the top that it more than once spills into outright cartoonishness.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,"If you're going to a no-frills action film, though, at least you want the action to be entertaining, which is where Transporter 3 falls down."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,50,Somehow Statham comes out of this improbable thriller with his dignity intact.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,42,"For those disappointed in the grim, gritty feel of the latest James Bond movie and who long for the absurdity of the Roger Moore-era entries, Transporter 3, ought to fit the bill."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"The movie has more lags in action than either of the previous episodes, and somehow the dialogue is even more daft"
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"The film does contain a couple of interesting thrills here and there. However, this film would have been better off thrown straight to DVD."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"Statham could do these movies in his sleep by now, so he gets credit for offering up so much dry wit. In fact, while Rudakova makes a painful acting debut, Statham appears more engaged than he has in a while."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,40,"Incoherent and inconsistent, this is a step back for Statham in his quest to become more than a cult figure."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,38,The thrill of the ridiculousness is gone. So is all the mystery that made Statham so appealing in the first place.
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,38,"Transporter 3 is made for airplane viewing, and not just any airplane: an Eastern European one, on the flight from Hrubbishnik to Slutnya."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,38,"At one point, Statham chases down a sports car while pedaling madly on a kids' bike. Pathétique!"
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,30,"Easily the worst in a trilogy that has been notable mainly for the presence of its everyman action star, Transporter 3 is a nonsensical, choppily edited bore, with awful dialogue."
Transporter 3,6.1,31715062,25,"The fight scenes are lackluster and the plot is needlessly complicated. If you're making an action film that centers on fast cars and fast women, it's usually best to keep the rest of the story simple."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,88,"A slick, scary, funny Creature Feature, beautifully photographed and splendidly acted in high adventure style."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,75,"Coil up with a tub of popcorn, get a stranglehold on your soda - this is a creepy, action-packed boat ride down a jungle river with lots of huge snakes dropping by for man-sized snacks."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,75,A trashily entertaining reptilian version of ''Jaws'' set in the steaming heart of the Amazon rain forest.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,70,"Voight's performance -- one of the film's pure, trashy delights -- is all leer, sneer and macho swagger, while the rest of the actors feel like the disposable snake-fodder they are."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,67,"A silly and plodding ""Jaws"" rip-off about a 40-foot man-eating snake on the prowl in the Brazilian rain forest."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"The biggest flaw can be summed up in a short phrase: lack of excitement. Thrillers are supposed to be crammed with thrills (hence the name), but Anaconda is relatively barren of them."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"Feels like ""Alien"" as directed by Jim Henson. And the suspense is restricted to mundane slasher-movie tactics, including the frequent use of a mobile camera (call it the condacam) thats supposed to represent the snakes point of view."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"Jon Voight, the all-purpose villain, does a pretty good job of imitating Marlon Brando imitating a Paraguayan snake expert, but the rest of the players--including Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Vincent Castellanos, Jonathan Hyde, and Kari Wuhrer--seem to be in a hurry to pick up their checks."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,"The movie provides a fair number of laughs, even if you can't help wondering how many of them were actually intentional."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,"In what is surely a tribute to the dazzling mediocrity of director Luis Llosa, the real jungle looks as bland as the fake jungle."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,Mr. Whipple squeezing his Charmin is scarier than this phony baloney computer effects-driven anaconda.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,38,"Quite unintentionally, director Luis Llosa and screenwriters Hans Bauer, Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. have crafted a howler; Anaconda, meant to be a nail-biting thriller, is a laugh-out-loud comedy."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,Such a classic combination of feckless dramaturgy and rampant excess that giving way to giggles is the only sane response.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"Although it's refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't, this frankness has a downside, because what the picture so unapologetically is isn't, in fact, much."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"So desperate and silly that here and there, it's a lot of fun."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"Charmless, unfrightening, and even devoid of the requisite gratuitous nudity, Anaconda just plain bites."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,25,"This film marks for Jon Voigt a concerted effort to unseat Christopher Walken in the competition for the Czarship of sneering, wheezing, Machiavellian, all-around weird guys. He spends much of his time standing around making a face like Beavis does when he's really freaked out."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,20,"If only director Luis Llosa and his cast could see the joke and seize upon it; instead, like its computer-morphed snake, the film doesn't have a clever bone in its body."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,88,"Bronco Billy is an odd salute to those clean hearted good guy cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, and Clint manages to revel in the glory of that myth despite the fact that he is probably more responsible for making that kind of Western unworkable in modern cinema than anyone else I can think of."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,80,"Basically, it's the charming tale of a New Jersey shoe-salesman who fantasises about being a cowboy, and takes a group of assorted weirdos on the road with a travelling show. Not a lot to it in terms of plot, but Eastwood manages to both undermine and celebrate his character's fantasy life, while offering a few gentle swipes at contemporary America (the Stars and Stripes tent sewn together by mental hospital inmates). Fragile, fresh, and miles away from his hard-nosed cop thrillers, it's the sort of film only he would, and could, make."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,80,"Low-key sentiment sets the stage for the new, improved Clint Eastwood -- relaxed, funny and refreshingly human. Bronco Billy is Dirty Harry with a sense of humor. More fun than a saloon full of six-shooters."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,80,"Eastwood is perfection as the New Jersey shoe clerk who, like Miniver Cheevey, dreamed a nostalgic dream and took action to realize it. The actor-director could have gone over the top by satirizing the very character he played so well in spaghetti westerns; instead he gives a sincere, realistic performance that silenced detractors who thought he could only play violent loners."
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,75,The best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while.
Bronco Billy,6.1,24265659,70,The movie is so shabbily written (by Dennis Hackin) and unevenly directed (by Eastwood himself) that the traditional obstacles to romantic comedy consummation are overwhelmed by superfluous complications and imprecise calculations.
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,100,"It's an allegory about the Vietnam war, a study of American character and a national propensity for violence. Southern Comfort is a masterpiece."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,80,"Beyond its genre roots and its deeper meanings, Southern Comfort is a well-honed study of characters and setting."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,80,A war film without the war but with some interesting observations nonetheless.
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Stripping these characters to their essences, Hill identifies a shared culture of hatred that unites a range of Americans."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Southern Comfort is a film of drum-tight professionalism. It is also, unfortunately, so committed to its allegorical vision that it never really comes alive as a story about people."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Arguably writer-director Walter Hill's best film to date, Southern Comfort works both as a pure action film and as an extremely effective allegory of America's involvement in Vietnam."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,75,"Southern Comfort is a thriller that twists one up in knots, whipping the audience up to a point where they may wish that director Walter Hill would just spring the damn gore already so as to relieve the tension he masterfully coils."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,70,"Pic is most exciting as a visual experience, as Walter Hill once again proves himself a consummate filmmaker with a great talent for mood, composition and action choreography."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,70,"Straight-line conflicts, low-light visuals: the film's basics, its strengths, and its critical Achilles' heel are all those of the classic American male action movie."
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,60,The latent wonder of Southern Comfort lies in Hill’s dangerously direction and a script that spits and curses like a troop of undomesticated delinquents.
Southern Comfort,7.2,5000000,60,"Though the film was photographed on what appear to have been extremely difficult locations in Louisiana and Texas, it never once convinces you that it's anything but pretentious moviemaking."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"This Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"The movie fixes you in its gravitational pull. It's an enveloping, walk-in vision... As rich and satisfying a movie as you're likely to see all year."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"In short, Batman is terrific - funny, smart and sensitive too, the perfect cinematic date."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,The Batblast of the summer.
Batman,7.6,251188924,91,Jack Nicholson as The Joker helpfully provides all the colour.
Batman,7.6,251188924,88,"Nicholson embellishes fascinatingly baroque designs with his twisted features, lavish verbal pirouettes and inspired excursions into the outer limits of psychosis. It's a masterpiece of sinister comic acting."
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,Burton's direction rises to a Wagnerian hysteria (an impression backed by Danny Elfman`s roaring orchestral score) as the two mortal enemies fight it out on the brink of a zillion-foot drop. Burton achieves a genuine majesty at that moment-though he would need one or two more like it to make Batman a genuinely memorable film.
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,"If Batman did nothing else but restore pulp-art shadow to the icon sanitized in his pop-art TV reincarnation, it would be an achievement. Tim Burton's Batman, starring a subdued Michael Keaton as you-know-who and a supercharged Jack Nicholson as the Joker, handily accomplishes that mission."
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,Batman is largely content to skim the surface and bask in the light of its visual style.
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"Despite its interesting, grim tone and undeniably striking visuals from director Burton and production designer Furst, the film fails to synthesize its strengths into a compelling whole."
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"The main problem is that Burton operates best on a modest scale; saddled with a blockbuster, he doesn't know how to animate all the dead space."
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"The movie's problem is that no one seemed to have any fun making it, and it's hard to have much fun watching it. It's a depressing experience."
Batman,7.6,251188924,70,"It's neither funny nor solemn. It has the personality not of a particular movie but of a product, of something arrived at by corporate decision."
Batman,7.6,251188924,70,"Nicholson's Joker will be the pivotal point for many. It's his energy, spurting like an artery, that keeps the picture alive; it's certainly not the special effects, the editing, which has no discernible rhythm, or the flaccid screenplay."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,85,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is as cheeky, cartoonish, and crazy as its predecessor, but it’s also commendably unafraid to demolish what had come before it if it’s in service of the story. The new dynamic between Eggsy and his team is great, and the Statesman prove amusing counterparts to these gentlemen spies from across the pond."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,80,"As ultraviolent as the first film, and as ultrasmutty, The Golden Circle will leave the Kingsfans grinning, even if its characters have less growing to do this time around."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,75,"With its inventively nutso action, youthful vibe, and subversive topicality, the “Kingsman” franchise feels more relevant than even Daniel Craig’s James Bond. Screen espionage doesn’t come any hipper these days."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,70,"The movie is too long, too violent, too silly—too everything. Yet for those who enjoyed the original Kingsman, it is a more than adequate second act. To put it another way: first time satire, second time farce."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,70,"This fleet-footed, glibly imaginative international romp stays on its toes and keeps its wits about it most of the time, with entertaining and pointedly U.S.-friendly cast additions."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"Like its predecessor, everything about the stylized Kingsman: The Golden Circle teeters just a little over the top: the elegant international production values, the perfectly tailored Savile Row attire, the hyperviolent action sequences, the depiction of something more than just an innocent hint of sex."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"Vaughn’s film is overflowing with big set pieces, but all those epic action sequences amount to a running time clocking nearly two and a half hours – and not much else. Like fireworks, they’re awe-inspiring while you’re watching, but there’s little left to marvel at after the show’s over."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"It’s fun, but it’s blockbuster overkill after an already-crowded summer season."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"“Kingsman” is essentially a live-action cartoon, one that aims for an audible reaction and little else. That may not be the world’s loftiest goal, but whether it results in a gagging eww or a chuckle, it’s a plan that usually succeeds."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"True Kingsman fans will appreciate that director Matthew Vaughn reacted to digs at ""The Secret Service"" for being gratuitously violent, sexually adolescent and politically reactionary by laying all of it on three times thicker."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,There’s fun to be had but it’s not consistent and at times it’s disappointing how certain scenes play out.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"The movie needs an editor, or a bartender, to remind the director when he’s hit the two-hour mark: Last orders, Mr. Vaughn."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"Sequelitis has Vaughn in its grip. The follow-up to his 2014 hyperviolent, boundlessly inventive spy-movie sendup gives the impression it’s trying a little too hard to surpass its predecessor."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,It’s a film so cartoonishly outsized that it almost renders the first film restrained by comparison
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"The movie has its moments, but the bloat and the blandness take their toll."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"Fun, fleeting entertainment if you’re after more of the same, but fails to carve out any fresh ground."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,This isn’t quite solid-gold filmmaking. But it might be gold-plated.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"Vaughn sticks to what he knows with his Kingsman sequel but rarely ups the ante, making this a fun-enough entry into an already-too-familiar franchise."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,55,"The Golden Circle isn’t strong on brains or heart, but it has no shortage of guts."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,51,"For all its supposed irreverence, the movie feels product-tested to the moon; there isn’t a single shot that isn’t trying to sell you something. The movie also has some of the creeping bro grossness of some of Vaughn’s other films."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"Just like the first movie, the film’s politics are all over the place in a way that should be fun but ends up feeling distracting. Yet it’s hard to hate this movie too much. It has a weird generosity toward its audience. It keeps giving and giving and giving, until you’re overstuffed. It’s a Thanksgiving feast movie, where you’re vaguely impressed at all of the effort, even if the individual elements leave something to be desired."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"A wild, reckless, gleefully immoral work of pop nihilism."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"Dumber and less stylish than its predecessor, Kingsman: The Secret Service, the cartoonish secret-agent pastiche Kingsman: The Golden Circle is also even more of an incoherent right-wing text, an exaggeration of the James Bond movies’ violence, fashion sense, and sex that keeps trying to pass off its ham-fisted conservative attitudes as smirking nihilism."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"In a movie as happy to resurrect characters as rub them out, nothing is of consequence, and the glibness grows numbing."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"It’s a big, vulgar, Saturday morning cartoon of a film, to both its benefit and detriment."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"It is all aggressively stylized, abusively fast-paced and ear-bleedingly loud, relying so heavily on CGI that nothing — not one thing — seems to correspond to the real world."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,42,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a tarnished sequel demolishing the original's balderdash charm in tumble-dry camera moves, CGI slosh and Elton John f-bombs."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,42,"If the first Kingsman, at its best, felt like a dry martini of a joke, then this one is more Jack and Mountain Dew — unsubtle, unrefreshing, and unnecessary."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"Vaughn hasn’t only run out of things to say but people to hate, and without that underlying aggression, the movie feels like it’s just going through the motions. Better luck next time, bruv."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"There’s plenty of action—and laughs here and there—but when a repeated cameo from Elton John is the best thing in a movie like this, you know you’re in trouble."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"It pulls off the impressive feat of feeling both hyperactive and lazy. This is hardly the first time a major Hollywood franchise has succumbed to narrative flabbiness, or invested in grand, elaborate world building with the kind of devotion that far outstrips the viewer’s interest."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a movie in search of a reason to exist. Despite a needlessly excessive running time, it never finds one."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"As kinetic as its predecessor — and just as belaboured — Kingsman: The Golden Circle serves up another batch of hyper-stylised action, irreverent humour and sharp threads, resulting in a film that’s not nearly as cool as it thinks it is."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle offers everything — several bored Oscar winners, two scenes featuring death by meat grinder, Elton John mugging in close-up — except a good time."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,"If you liked the original, the best way to preserve that memory is to stay away from this sequel."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,The hollow grandeur of the film's action only gives the proceedings a glib undertone that also undermines the rare occasions of earnestness that the heroes exhibit toward fallen comrades.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,30,"Unfortunately, overkill is the order of the day — and it takes a toll. There are too many supporting characters, too much exposition, too many gadgets, too many “Matrix”-inspired, slow-motion fight sequences, too many plot holes instead of twists and too ham-handed a political message about the war on drugs."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,30,"Bloated, inexplicably un-entertaining."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,25,"Despite all the mayhem, “The Golden Circle” often feels slow and belabored, particularly in its middle section, when inspiration is nowhere to be found, and the chaos seems to be there just for the sake of being there."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,25,"That’s what Kingsman: The Golden Circle is like — recycled Bond gags and settings, sophomoric humor, and maybe an hour of dead time scattered throughout a two hour and fifteen minute mess."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,20,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the bloated, campy, thoroughly stupid sequel to the 2014 action thriller ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."""
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,20,"This crazily overlong and tiresome follow-up...doesn’t seem to have the first idea what to do with itself – not least when it comes to its much-vaunted all-star cast, the majority of whom are barely even in it."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,16,"Taken on it’s own merits — or lack thereof – Kingsman: The Golden Circle feels like being trapped in a dorm room, while a bunch of frat bros watch the first Kingsman and tell you it’s the greatest movie ever made."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,0,"It’s violence for cowardly voyeurs who want to make the people who annoy them just shut up in a way that’s silent, sterile, and thoroughly humiliating to the victim."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,100,The good humor bubbles up from a deep reservoir of affection for Hollywood schlock.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,100,"The best, surely the smartest, English-language movie of the year to date."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,Everything an action-comedy should be. It achieves through parody what most films in the genre can't accomplish straight.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,"In addition to the marvelous lead cast, all sorts of funny performers show up in cameo roles, including Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Dalton."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,"It's not hard to imagine these characters in a straight-faced Hollywood blockbuster. And that's the source of Hot Fuzz's genius, pointing out the thin line that separates convention from farce when Hollywood starts throwing its special effects around."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"For most of its running time, it's an enjoyably unpretentious celebration of the guilty pleasure we can take from a stupid-as-all-get-out car chase or from watching things blow up real good. Then, in its final half hour, Wright and Pegg ratchet up the absurdity tenfold and enter the realm of the sublime."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"Wright and Pegg are storytellers who weave their naughty bits into genuine characters and a plot. It's a ridiculous plot, but one that's absolutely in the spirit of the films they're satirizing."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"Summer hasn't arrived, but the funniest riff on a summer movie genre has already landed."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,88,"If you see Hot Fuzz, you'll never again watch a Michael Bay film without howling with disrespectful laughter."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,88,It's as laceratingly entertaining as its predecessor.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,88,"Pegg and Wright are armed with an endlessly impressive arsenal of attention grabbers, from witty editing tricks to a wry soundtrack and a joke-packed script that demands multiple viewings."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"In the very funny cop comedy Hot Fuzz, overachieving London police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) commits a very British sin: He's too good."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"Hot Fuzz is something all too rare in movie comedies: a story rather than a string of disjointed skits, with hearty characters behind its caricatures."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"It's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,A sustained genre parody that's equally funny but (maybe in deference to the genre) much more pumped up.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"A British variation on Hollywood nonsense, and as such it's a little gloomier, a little coarser, and a lot more cerebral--oh, and funnier than all the ""Reno 911!"" boxed sets combined."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"Since Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg are essentially parodying self-parodies, they have also smartly kinked up their conceit by setting most of the film in a sleepy village that might as well be called Ye Old English Towne, thereby wedding one of the most irritating British exports to one of the most absurd American ones. Think of it as ""The Full Monty"" blown to smithereens."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,The boys (now in blue) have done it again.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,At once deeply affectionate and sharply observed: There's never anything smart-alecky about Wright's approach as a director.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"The whole enterprise goes far beyond pastiche, wreathing its characters in a film-intoxicated world."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"Really, do we need another dumb action movie to remind us how dumb action movies are?...Yes. We absolutely do."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"The thrill of Hot Fuzz is the chemistry between Nicholas and local oaf Danny Butterman, who is an action film aficionado and finds Nicholas' stories utterly engrossing."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,78,The most originally funny movie to hit U.S. screens in a while.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"A little too long and suffers from a sagging midsection when the level of exposition becomes laborious, but the spectacularly entertaining final 30 minutes compensates for a lot of flaws."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,It's a blast.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"The best of it is a riot--a ""Bad Boys II"" fireball hurled with exquisite accuracy at a quaint English town peopled by Agatha Christie archetypes."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"With Hot Fuzz, you'll just have to settle for semi-hilarity."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"A real actioner, generous with the bullets and blood and chase scenes, that simultaneously mocks shoot-'em-ups."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"Plays like two films in one, and succeeds on both levels."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"It's to the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"It's bloody carnage - or it's ketchup, or bolognese sauce, at the very least."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,Deeply nuts and exhaustingly hilarious.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,70,"Hot Fuzz deploys the same mix of genre conventions, slapstick and old-school British humor that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" such a dumb-but-good romp."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,70,"Hot Fuzz is fun, and it's nice to see all the English character actors who aren't busy in Harry Potter films, but it lacks its predecessor's freshness."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,63,"Basically a one-joke movie, and they take their sweet time -- too much of it, actually -- getting to the good stuff. But what excellent laughs they provide in the end."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,63,"Though it's no ""Monty Python,"" Hot Fuzz is a clever, over-the-top marriage of mayhem and merriment."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,60,"All the action is staged with energy, but it gets relentless without anything really funny going on."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,The World’s End isn’t perfect – – but its best moments leave the bulk of recent American “event movies” gasping in the dust.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,"The World’s End not only makes a more than worthy conclusion to the Cornetto trilogy — it stands on its own as one of the sharpest, saddest and wisest comedies of the year."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,"What ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" did for zombie and cop flicks The World's End does for sci-fi fatalism, respecting its doomsday tropes while presenting them with cheeky wit and a refreshing strategy of sensory underload."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,"The beauty of this movie, both a nostalgic romp and a futuristic scream, is its stubborn insistence on getting all the trapped-in-amber details right."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,This is by light-years the most entertaining movie of the year. How many apocalyptic sci-fi action extravaganzas leave you feeling as if the world is just beginning?
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,An ordinary drama embellished and in some sense infringed on by genre elements rather than the other way around.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,91,"Easily one of the year’s best comedies, the movie thrives off the chemistry between its leads, with Pegg painting a very funny portrait of emotional paralysis and Frost demonstrating a heretofore unseen talent for intimidation."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,90,"Indeed, while the action-packed final act of The World’s End gets pretty formulaic (as it channels everything from “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” to “The Stepford Wives”), there’s ALMOST something serious at the core of this riotous comedy."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,90,"As in all of Wright’s films, the surface is just as satisfying as the subtext: hilarious comedy, compelling character drama, eye-popping visuals, and a juicy science-fiction story."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,"Wright is a brilliant director of turbocharged exposition, elegant but bruising action sequences, and graphically bold comedic overkill."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,It'll knock you on you ass from laughing when you're not rubbing your eyes in disbelief.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,"The cast is amazing, from the great duo of Frost and Pegg to the supporting players, many of whom are better known for taking on heavy dramatic fare. The editing, special effects and set design — a joy to experience."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,"The movie is madly, wonderfully at odds with itself."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,87,"A knowing take on movies and maturity alike, The World’s End is just as thoroughly thoughtful as those which came before it, and maybe more than ever, you’ll find yourself laughing to keep from crying."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,83,"As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"There is something weird about the twins, something that will fuel a bar room brawl until it goes quite literally global, that will let director Wright take a leap into another genre entirely and that will allow The World's End to spin into ever grander comic mayhem, even as it becomes a surprisingly effecting look at the folly of trying to recapture one's youth."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The buzz of The World’s End is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor. There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end — no “Hangover,” in other words. I’ll drink to that."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,The World's End stands on its own as hilarious high-end nonsense.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"Some inner logic may not hold up under the sober light of day, but this unusual action-comedy has the loosey-goosey feel of something that can’t miss, like a soused round of bar pool. The final triumph: In a summer full of capes and masks, beer-bellied Frost tears off his shirt à la the Hulk. It’s this season’s best superhero moment."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"Audacious and witty, The World's End is a strange brew."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"A mix of comedy, science fiction, nostalgia, adolescent wish-fulfillment and beer, beer, beer, its parts shouldn’t fit together as neatly as they do. But somehow Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have again managed to make a movie that is knowing, touching and hilarious."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The World's End is a big, shaggy dog of a thing, a free-spirited ramble held together by off-kilter asides, clever-dumb puns, and seemingly random bits of dialogue that could almost become catchphrases in spite of themselves."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The armageddon-through-beer-goggles approach brings the chuckles, but The World’s End stands up as a great example of the genre it ribs. Nostalgic, bittersweet and very, very funny."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The World’s End is a fitting end to the trilogy: it is by turns trashy, poignant and gut-bustingly funny, and often all three at once."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"While things get a tad buckled town in mayhem and special effects throughout the film’s busy final reels, Wright spends enough time sketching out his mischievous middle-aged men so that their journey...feels worthwhile and even meaningful for a few of them."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"Bravely refusing to rigidly adhere to a formula that has been so successful, Wright, Pegg and Frost’s Cornetto Trilogy closer has tonal shifts you won’t expect, but the same beating heart you’ve been craving."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"This is a tighter, smarter film than either Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, and buried beneath all the blue-goo aliens and terrible punning is a heartfelt meditation on the perils and pleasures of nostalgia."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,78,The World’s End affectionately takes a page from our Fifties sci-fi films.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"There's a lot of fun to be had in watching The World's End and, surprisingly, more thematic depth than one might expect. The humor, true to its British roots, may baffle some Americans but those who ""get"" it will laugh quite a bit."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,This movie’s pleasures are less about its villains and more about the interplay between Pegg and Frost.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"When the movie is funny, it’s very funny."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Until the sci-fi switcheroo, the versatile supporting cast puts Gary in such a ridiculous light that we can’t help laughing at him. Then suddenly this subversive movie challenges us to laugh at our own assumptions."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"The result is an original picture, not entirely successful, but successful enough, and delightful in its ability to surprise viewers, and juggle tones and keep every ball in the air. The World's End has the aura - and this might only be an attractive illusion - of something imagined whole, in a burst of inspiration, rather than as something labored over."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Smart, funny, and gross (often at the same time)."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"The World’s End builds to an unexpectedly witty, funny climax that flies in the face of most films of its genre, and although its humor is not for all tastes, no one can say this crazy picture doesn’t have the guts to live up to its title."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Despite a too-long third act, dragging action sequences and an epilogue that would have been better left on the cutting room floor, the wordy wit and ingenuity of The World’s End is a sloppy triumph over this summer’s other alien/robot hybrid flick, ""Pacific Rim."""
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,This is a movie that floats by on dazzlingly silly banter and well-slung slang.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Despite its shortcomings, The World's End glistens with a comedic energy not present in equivalent mainstream blockbusters."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,70,A fraction less gut-bustingly goofy than its predecessors.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,70,"The World’s End is more frantic than funny, but it’s still funny enough — just — to outweigh its own silliness."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,63,"The premise of visiting so many pubs as a narrative device, however, bogs down the initially energetic pacing and goofiness. Piling on the mayhem renders The World's End a sometimes chaotic and uneven comedy."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,63,"Also helping to sell it all is the fact that these films, goofy though they may be, feature a consistently high level of acting. In addition to Pegg, we get Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit""), Paddy Considine (""Red Riding""), Eddie Marsan (""Sherlock Holmes"") and Bill Nighy (""Love Actually""), all of whom have appeared previously in the trilogy."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,60,"As a film whose central theme emphasizes the dangers of living in the past, Wright, Pegg and Frost become fatally distracted by nostalgia, eventually paying too much homage to previous classics—especially their own—to create another film that deserves to stand alongside them."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,58,"The movie independently bungles everything it tries, like a Central Park busker who simultaneously sucks at juggling, harmonica playing and skateboarding."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,100,"It's risky making an action picture that breaks its violent stride to emphasize the difficulties of living up to preconceived ideas of masculinity. But it's that risk that makes Black Rain distinctive. By refusing to beat its Eastern and Western protagonists into comic-book pulp, the movie pays them, and the audience, a rare compliment."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,90,"In Black Rain, director Ridley Scott and his team pump in so much pyrotechnic razzle-dazzle that the movie becomes a triumph of matter over mind. It's a blast of pure sensation, shallow but scintillating, like a great rock melody, superbly produced, where the music pumps you up even as the lyrics drag you down."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,75,"No matter how well dressed, the movie can’t escape the gravitational pull of formula. Without a convincing subtext, Black Rain is pretty dull fare indeed."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,75,"Black Rain is chock-full of moments, jazzy scenery and snazzy bits of dialogue, and stuffed with steroids. It's big, maybe too big for its shallow notions and commonplace structure. But it is also beautiful and terrible in the same ways that other Scott movies have been eye-filling. With its teeming Asian landscape, its dark kaleidoscopic palette and its heavily layered composition, it's reminiscent of Blade Runner. But this is an atmosphere that needs Sam Spade, not Dirty Harry."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,70,"The story of Black Rain is thin and prefabricated and doesn't stand up to much scrutiny, so Scott distracts us with overwrought visuals."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,63,"At its best, Black Rain has the glitzy quality of an extremely long and clever television commercial. One can't be sure what is being sold, but the eye isn't bored."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,63,"Director Ridley Scott's visual gifts are still evident in Black Rain. But with retread plot and characters, Scott's stylistic flourishes become irritating clutter."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,60,"Ridley Scott directed this 1989 feature, and while there's a lot of his characteristic atmospherics—smoke, fog, neon, yellow light, rain, and squalor—to fill all the dead spaces, he's still a long way from the splendors of Blade Runner. The script by Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis doesn't give him or Douglas very much to chew on, apart from a lot of unpleasant xenophobia about Japanese gangsters, and the plot never gets far beyond the formulaic and the forgettable, hammered into place by Hans Zimmer's pounding and numbing score."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,60,"The crosscultural action picture might have worked if the filmmakers had come up with a script in which Douglas' character had been rendered weak and confused by being a fish trying to swim in strange waters. But instead he is presented as a traditional action hero dominating everyone in sight. The cultural imperialism of that decision makes for a routine and frequently offensive story full of Asian stereotypes. Director Scott (Blade Runner, Alien) certainly knows how to photograph arresting architecture, but the high-gloss look of Black Rain only intensifies the shortcomings of the pedestrian story."
Black Rain,6.6,46212055,50,"Director Ridley Scott's Black Rain belongs to the blunt instrument school of filmmaking. This cop thriller, set largely in Osaka, Japan, is so full of screeching tires, flashing neon and extravagant violence that it's almost physically painful to watch, yet that seems to be the effect the director had in mind. If you smack the audience around enough, you'll be respected for your power."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,75,"The movie suffers from being the same shape as so many modern blockbusters, and the plot in the second half of the film is basically another riff on the “reach the glowing doodad on a roof to prevent the end of the world” structure. But the focus on the Turtles and the film’s overall amiable sense of goofball humor carries the day."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,67,"Fortunately, Green’s sequel doesn’t have much interest in frustrations; this is a movie about unbridled joy, about transposing a cartoon veneer over a bleak human world."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,63,"""Out of the Shadows” isn’t going to win any awards, good or bad. Neither an embarrassment nor a triumph, it is nevertheless an improvement over the last film."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,63,"This sequel is a good improvement over the 2014 adventure that rebooted the franchise. The effects are better, the pacing is tighter and the overall impact is much more entertaining."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,60,"Does its best to include as much fan fodder as it does kiddie fare with the distinct personalities of the four Turtles — ""Mikey,"" ""Leo,"" ""Raph"" and ""Donnie"" — faithful enough to previous incarnations that both should be happier with the sequel over its predecessor."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,58,"So while Out of the Shadows may not be any smarter than the first installment (or really all that smart at all), it’s certainly a lot more fun."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,58,"While it’s not necessarily a good thing to aim this kind of weaponized marketing at kids, it’s also silly and colorful enough to nearly work as a live-action cartoon. It might rot brains, but perhaps not while regarding them with utter contempt."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"Its openly mercenary ethos initially scan as a bracing lack of pretense in a market crammed to the gills with insidious faux-sentimentality, but its overstuffed relentlessness proves almost equally tedious."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"They’re back for an entertaining enough 3-D sequel to their 2014 franchise revival, and so is the rest of the cast that includes foxy Megan Fox and her ability to wear a naughty schoolgirl outfit."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"This is a production from producer Michael Bay, master of the cinema of CG run amok. And all we helpless mortals can do is cower and duck as those 3D fists fly."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"This unambitious Michael Bay-produced version doesn’t seem interested in cleverness, cravenly settling for the usual generic CGI shtick."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,It’s surprisingly enjoyable even if you aren’t already in the bag for the turtles.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"Packed with better action sequences and a smidgeon more emotional resonance, this sequel may be more engaging than its predecessor, but the franchise remains a rather clattering and crude affair."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"The film fares best when it slows down a bit and allows the Turtles' personalities, which are quite engaging, to shine through via their amusing comic banter."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,42,"Out of the Shadows stumbles from one set piece to the next, rarely offering viewers much reason to care in between, and its halfhearted attempts at moving toward the “dark and gritty” end of the comic-book spectrum never land."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,42,"Out of the Shadows’ barrels forward like such a rampaging beast that it decimates everything – plot, character, emotion, basic visual lucidity – in its wake."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"No groundbreaking cinemagic there, but Out of the Shadows’ oddball moments keep things weirdly surreal throughout."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"This movie is, it happens, easier to sit through than the 2014 film. The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are even a couple of amusing, albeit unmemorable, sight gags and one-liners."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"True, Out of the Shadows is an improvement over the last Ninja Turtles movie, but only in the way that a mild cold is an improvement over the flu. It’s not good, but at least it’s not so terrible that it makes you want to lie in bed for a few days."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"Considerably better than its predecessor, the central four may give it their all but the people behind this franchise sadly don’t seem all that interested in their crime-fighting, pizza-eating heroes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,38,"Ultimately, any sass, sentiment and personality are obliterated in the noisy chaos of the climax, which is a grayish brown blur of flying spaceship parts, whirling turtle shells and shouts of ""the beacon!"" It's more cacophonous than cinematic, and loses the quirky charm of the cartoon in the avalanche of computer-generated violence."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,38,"It’s still just a patience-testing bauble for anybody over the age of 12. The Turtles, in this latest incarnation, were and remain shiny but stupid entertainment for kids."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,33,"To his credit, Green makes great use of wide-angle photography so the action feels comprehensible, with surprisingly long shots and effective editing. It’s just a shame the director’s talents are wasted on this brand-stamped mess."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,30,"Visual spectacle still takes precedence over coherent plotting, and the human characters retain all the gravitas of generic placeholders who accidentally made it into the shooting script."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"Cowabunga, the vigilante demi-gods on a half shell are back, and more inane and irritating than ever. Their antics make the 112 minutes it takes to watch this frenetic followup to 2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a torturous mindfuck for any sentient being over the age of  infancy."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"This is the kind of movie that leaves you with the impression that more thought was put into catchphrases and fan service than into a compelling plot, thoughtful characterizations or imaginative action choreography."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"A subpar 3D action comedy featuring four giant motion-capture animated turtles and a raft of human costars, including the dreamy-eyed Fox, wide-shouldered Perry, a remarkably slender Will Arnett, and Laura Linney, who looks tired and uncomfortable throughout the proceedings."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"There are isolated moments of humor, and even charm. The visual effects are at times outstanding. But these positives are overwhelmed by the uninspired whole."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,20,"Forget cowabunga, this is cowadunga. Still, the Oscar for Most Shamefully Contrived Scene goes to the scriptwriters for managing to get franchise eye-candy Megan Fox into a sexy schoolgirl outfit, which, any shorter, would land the film with an R rating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,20,"It’s soon clear that OOTS follows the model of Bay’s Transformers sequels. Longer, louder and boasting even more hardware, it does everything to generate the illusion of bleeding-edge bang-per-buck, while cribbing shamelessly from 1991’s Secret of the Ooze."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,100,"This over-the-top, ultraviolent, hyperkinetic action thriller pretty much has it all."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,90,"It takes about an hour after it's over for the heart to slow, the brain to recalibrate, and the nonsensicalness of the thing to sink in."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,83,"Bekmambetov revs it up furiously and unleashes one bit of hyperactive, dazzling invention after another. The result is a throwaway wrapped up in the coolest packaging imaginable, which is acres better than the opposite."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,83,What's bleakly hilarious about the whole movie is that Bekmambetov directs the nonaction scenes just as hyperbolically.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"Like it or not, Wanted pretty much slams you to the back of your chair from the outset and scarcely lets up for the duration."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"Not as dark as its source material, Wanted works exceptionally on its own terms. McAvoy crashes the A-list, Jolie finally gets to be as big a star on screen as she has been in print, and Bekmambetov proves the most exciting action-oriented emigré since John Woo."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,The summer's zazziest action movie.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"For all of its shortcomings, Wanted is a strangely enjoyable flick."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"If you're looking for memorable dialogue and gripping drama, then you better get in line for another flick. But if it's spellbinding special effects and high-wire acts you crave, Wanted should be at the top of your list for big budget thrill rides."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Brutal, sexy, built to thrill and minus a scintilla of redeeming social value, the movie -- based on a series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones -- explodes like summer fireworks."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"The way to enjoy this film is to put your logic on hold, along with any higher sensitivities that might be vulnerable and immerse yourself as if in a video game."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Jolie steals the film from nominal star McAvoy in the wild gunfight and dynamically absurd chase that kick Wanted into high gear. Her wicked moves and seductive smirk brand her immediately as a true believer who really, really loves her work."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"His movies are thrilling and ridiculous in equal measure, and I often laughed with incredulous approval as he wreaked havoc."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Best of all, there's a lot of Jolie, barrels blazing. The star's fearlessly sexy hauteur is unique in the biz today. And when she works it in Wanted, she kills, bullets optional."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"There are times when the film is flat-out silly (such as the spinning car assassination), but that's part of the movie's charm. At its worst, Wanted is never boring. At its best, it can be damn close to intoxicating. One word, written without apology, describes it best: fun."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,This is a blockbuster busting out of the block; this is a Hollywood staple served up on a European platter; this is summertime fare with a wintry verve.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Wanted is like a 12-armed heavy-metal drummer after a case of Red Bull, flailing and thundering through two hours of impossible action."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"In the end, Wanted may be most notable for cementing the connection between superhero movies and the cinematic craze they have temporarily supplanted, torture porn--both genres that, like ""Fight Club,"" address our ambiguous fascination with being powerless and invulnerable at the same time."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"With its pounding, bloody violence, foul-mouthed language and putrid worldview, Wanted isn't comic book-y on a par with ""Iron Man"" or ""The Incredible Hulk."" Rather it's an example of revenge of the nerds at its nastiest and most vulgar."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Before Wanted reaches the end of its wild course, the violence that's been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive; the ritual carnage becomes balletic carnage (railroad cars included); the Walter Mitty-esque hero, Wesley, played by James McAvoy becomes a formidable enforcer of summary justice, and Mr. McAvoy, most memorably the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland,"" becomes a certified star."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Wanted's hyperkinetic antics are sometimes weighed down by a surfeit of adolescent misanthropy. But the adrenaline-overdose strategy works for viewers as well as hit men. As long as Bekmambetov keeps the pedal to the metal, you don't notice the rotten scenery outside."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Fast-moving and bloody, enjoyable even within its unapologetically generic limits. But McAvoy is its real secret weapon: With his X-ray blue eyes and lips that look bitten with anxiety, he has the miraculous ability to fool us into thinking there's really something at stake here."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"A compendium of bedside erotica. I don't know when I've seen a mainstream movie that so explicitly caters to the S&M niche. And the chemistry of the central couple, which seemed destined to bring the movie down, is instead the hottest thing in this effects-laden but ultimately empty film."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,67,Wanted is a queasily unapologetic power fantasy about becoming a better person through violence.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,The thrilling stunts and hyperkinetic action scenes are the undisputed stars of this surprisingly entertaining film.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Wanted is head-spinning stuff, and it's easy to get caught up in its masterfully manipulated mayhem. Visually, and viscerally, it's pretty awesome."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Slick, stylish and super-violent, but also oddly dull."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Preposterous, luridly entertaining."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,60,"As nonsense goes, this has a certain gusto and glee, and what dismayed me was that Bekmambetov felt the need to spice it with the addition of coarsely chopped violence."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,60,"There's barely a frame that doesn't look stretched, smashed or otherwise harassed. Imagine ""The Matrix"" on speed, and you're halfway there."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Wanted has one good plot twist in store (though it makes little sense), and its sense of humor about its own silliness keeps the fantasy afloat for a while. But as the body count rises, so does the portentous tone, and the relentlessness of Bekmambetov's overamped style becomes oppressive."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"What are Jolie and Freeman and McAvoy doing here, besides acting cooler than Clive Owen in ""Shoot ’Em Up""? Cashing a check, that's what. Bekmametov may have talent, but the arrested-adolescent ""escapism"" of this picture emits a pretty bad odor."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Things happen in Wanted, but no one cares. You could call that nihilism, but even nihilism requires commitment of a kind and this, by contrast, is a movie built on indifference."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Either a go-for-broke action movie or a sick, sick movie for a sick, sick public."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"The film hardly aims to be serious entertainment, and, to its credit, it's never uninteresting visually."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,42,"Violence in the movies, no matter how many CGI effects are utilized, can't help but be far more luridly realistic. And, in the case of Wanted, to what end?"
Wanted,6.7,134508551,30,"Big, cruel, stupid actioner."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,20,"With every bit of sliced flesh and every punctured skull I found myself wondering who exactly this movie is for. Its unflinching violence has earned it an R rating, meaning its desired demographic – teenage boys – is out of contention. That raises the question: Are there really adults who want to sit through this kind of mindless, bullying mayhem?"
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Despite the very real threat and the personal stakes and the grim weight given to things, director Sam Mendes manages to pay sophisticated, sincere homage to the conventions that define the Bond series while remembering that one of the things that makes the series such an enduring presence is fun."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Skyfall triumphantly reinvents 007 in one of the best Bonds ever. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,The movie's assured direction by Sam Mendes can't be underestimated.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"The third starring the totally captivating cool cucumber Daniel Craig as Agent 007 - is both an elegy and a mission statement. It's also a great, long-lasting jolt of pleasure."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,The Daniel Craig era comes of age with a ballsy Bond that takes brave chances and bold risks. Guess what? Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Putting the ""intelligence"" in MI6, Skyfall reps a smart, savvy and incredibly satisfying addition to the 007 oeuvre, one that places Judi Dench's M at the center of the action."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,91,"He's 9Mendes) discovered his stride here, a blend of thrills and sabotage and deep-dish emotionalism. The powerful performances by Craig and Dench surely owe a great deal to his indulgences."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,91,"Skyfall doesn't forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"The great success for Mendes and Craig, however, is that while Skyfall obviously has a great fondness for the past, it's not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond's future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"Skyfall is a push-pull between the past and the present, an effort to drag a symbol of maleness as iconic as the Union Jack bulldog on M's desk into a world of approximate gender equality and approximate acceptance of sexual difference. I'm not sure how sustainable that is over the long term; this is a smashing entertainment, but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"We need 007, even after half a century of his ups and downs in various incarnations, to remind us how deeply pleasurable an action thriller can be. The latest addition to the Bond canon goes beyond thrilling into chilling and enthralling, plus a kind of stirring that has nothing to do with martinis."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"The stars and the explosions are backed up by plenty of class - Ralph Fiennes as M's new boss, Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe as a couple of the requisite Bond beauties, and Judi Dench finally given the space to turn M into a full-bodied character."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"Dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor, this beautifully made film will certainly be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal fans worldwide and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner than four years from now."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Skyfall is far and away the best, and the most British of the Daniel Craig-James Bond movies."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,Mendes' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie truly special is the attention he gives his actors.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"With a powerful jolt, 007 feels relevant again, with serious questions about espionage vs. cyber hacking amid the fun."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Ultimately Skyfall is rooted in tradition - and in British soil. A pastoral drive to Bond's boyhood home (in a kind of car that will delight purists) opens the gates to some psychological background, and given the true-love subtext of ""Casino Royale,"" it's not surprising that there's an emotional payoff here."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Best of all, we finally learn something about Bond's origins: The movie takes its title from his ancestral home in Scotland. (A nod to Connery, perhaps?)"
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"This is Bond like you've never seen him, almost Freudian in his vulnerability. And a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"While the protracted third act doesn't kill the two-hour, 23-minute picture, ""Casino Royale"" remains the best of the recent Bonds, with Skyfall just a notch below it."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Skyfall can take its place alongside ""From Russia with Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" as the best Bond can offer."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,Skyfall is one of the best Bonds in the 50-year history of moviedom's most successful franchise.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Bond's latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series: at once solemn and deeply funny, sexy and sad, self-conscious without all the rib-bruising elbowing."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,85,"Working with the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, Mendes also presents some stunning sequences of beauty in a film where you might not expect such a thing."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,83,"Best of all is the bad guy. Javier Bardem was always a tantalizing choice to play a Bond villain, and his Silva is a terrific creation, and certainly the most memorable villain in the series in decades."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Mendes...lets the quieter moments breathe.... But Mendes is rather good at being loud, too, and his nine times Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins makes the wildly ambitious action sequences the most beautiful in Bond’s 50-year career."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall is a highly distinctive Bond movie. It has some stunning visual touches.... Also, it mostly manages to convince us that there’s something at stake by giving a hint of Bond’s emotional life beyond this story."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall drips in the legacy of Bond, standing tall as an action-packed swansong to Britain's best loved hero of recent years, whilst also showing a great deal of affection for the decades of movies that have come before."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"In Skyfall, Mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air - which really makes him the hero of this saga."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"As Bond sprints from peril to pleasure, Mr. Craig and the other players - including an exceptional, wittily venal Javier Bardem, a sleek Ralph Fiennes and a likable Ben Whishaw - turn out to be the most spectacular of Mr. Mendes's special effects."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall has the feel of both a ceremonial commemoration and a franchise-rebooting celebration, especially in the ways it attempts to too cutely sync up the '60s-era Bond mythos (casual misogyny and all) with the more complicatedly ""Bourne""-inflected recent episodes."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"It's an unusually funny, literate, worked-out script, and Mendes seems hell-bent on making the best Bond since ""Goldfinger"" - or the best, period, given that he exhumes Bond's old Aston Martin only to shoot it cheekily to pieces."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Though a notch below ""Royale,"" Skyfall follows that reboot's lead, making a now 50-year-old icon as cool as when he began."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"Skyfall is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One Skyfall is enough."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it's clear that Skyfall will be both classic and of-the-moment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"With gadgets, girls and globe-trotting held to a minimum, Skyfall, could, for long stretches, be mistaken for just another 21st-century thriller, albeit a well-made and intelligent one."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,Skyfall is certainly the most cultured Bond film to come along in some time. It's also the first of the three Craig endeavors to seriously (and wittily) acknowledge its pedigree.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,70,"While trading on viewers’ familiarity with the series’ venerable fetishes (a cheer rises at the sight of Bond’s old Aston Martin and the sound of Monty Norman’s guitar theme from Dr. No), Skyfall has the life, grandeur and gravity of a satisfying, stand-alone entertainment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,70,"As much as it's open about its paranoia of the new, Skyfall's fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends. Like this summer's Spider-Man, Batman, and Avengers movies, Skyfall seems to exist primarily to set up the events of subsequent films."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,67,"What's in a name? Lately, less and less. With Daniel Craig's third go at 007, I'm not sure there's much left that distinguishes Bond from Bourne from Batman. They're all slurping from the same soup – think: death-haunted, self-righteous, tight-lipped and -quipped, parkour enthusiast."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,Skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go. It's the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,"The sky is far from falling on the Bond franchise. In fact, it is as good as it has ever been. What's more, Craig is reportedly on board for at least two more outings, so Q had better get to work on those bifocals because 007 is no where near ready for retirement."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,"While director Sam Mendes, aided and abetted by a crack technical team, delivers big-screen action with panache and style, something about this Bond feels a little off."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,All of which works terrifically well up to a point.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,These are truly tedious stakes for an action movie. The franchise isn't worried about world safety. It's fretting over whether to start wearing Depends.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,50,"In the utterly routine effort Skyfall, we're actually expected to cheer each chord we've heard so many times (here's a martini shaker! Look, it's a Walther PPK! And there's an Aston Martin!) We've been turned into wretched Pavlovian dogs, salivating at the bell instead of the snack. The highlight, by far, is a classic animated credit sequence: Adele, you are the new Shirley Bassey."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,70,"Robin Hood is no classic, but if it sometimes seems like it’s trying to be “Baz Luhrmann’s Robin Hood,” more power to it. The movie is a diverting live-wire lark — one that, for my money, gets closer to the spirit of what Robin Hood is about than the logy 1991 Kevin Costner version or the dismal 2010 Russell Crowe version."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,63,"While it plays fast and loose with loaded political iconography, this Robin Hood brings a whole new dimension to this age-old tale."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,63,"Robin Hood’s shameless silliness only takes it so far, as the film is frequently undermined by Otto Bathurst’s wobbly direction."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"You could build a suspension bridge over the gap between what Robin Hood could have been and what it is. Its hero is credible as a man who wants to rob from the rich and give to the poor, but the storytelling is so impoverished that the message can't stick."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"Well, the Hood would never stand for it and neither should you. Defy authority and watch this movie on a plane instead."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,Say this and little else for the new Robin Hood movie: It’s less of a self-serious slog than the last Robin Hood movie.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,The action is violent and improbable but not staged with particular pizazz.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,Some of the film is slow. Some of it is silly.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"Grimly upbeat rather than merry, and relentless rather than frenetic, the film’s gritty zest is splashed across the screen with momentum, but also to the point of overuse. It serves a late heist set piece well, yet wears thin in a sea of training, thieving and fighting montages elsewhere."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"On all fronts, it strives to twist the Robin Hood story into something more provocative, but ultimately it’s a garbled, hollow mess of attempts at relevancy."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,45,"It’s a straightforward retelling with a confusing design philosophy, disappointing action sequences, weak storytelling and a cast which clearly deserved better material."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,42,"Rife with stereotypes, a terrible script, and odd “300”-esque cinematography that just doesn’t fit, this is not only a film nobody asked for, but also one that nobody should be forced to endure."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"It’s a world that is so incoherent and inconsistent you almost have to admire the chutzpah, in which buxom lady horse-thieves dress themselves for a night of crime displaying several inches of showy cleavage, contained only by a glorified shoelace."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,This version will make you side with the Sheriff of Nottingham.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"Like Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur, this tries hard to do something new and exciting with an old formula. It quickly makes you wish for something more traditional and straightforward."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"This bloated, featureless, CGI-heavy movie is not so much stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, as stealing from Guy Ritchie, Batman, Two-Face and a few others – and not giving back all that much to the audience."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,30,"Robin Hood isn’t as awful as all that, really. For one thing, it’s too singularly bizarre to be anything less than head scratchingly entertaining, and the action set-pieces are pulled off with much quivery panache."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,30,"The plot is twisty in a perfunctory way, the action predictably explosive, the sought-after exhilaration nonexistent."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,Egerton is miscast. He and Hewson have nary a spark in their love scenes. Dornan overplays his hand. Foxx belts out nearly every line as if he’s trying to be heard above a parade of fire engines on a Fourth of July parade
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"What balderdash. And not the fun kind, either."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"There’s nothing particularly memorable about Robin Hood even when you’re laughing at it, and that may be one of the saddest fates a movie can meet."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"The more invested you are in the old-fashioned Robin Hood of legend — the less likely you are to enjoy what amounts to a chilly and flavorless frappé of historical speculation, revisionist folklore and every lazy action-movie cliche ever written."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"The latest labored take on the old British legend, Robin Hood is little more than a pitch-black war film, complete with rudimentary medieval bombs and blood spatter on the camera lens."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"If nothing else, this accidentally hilarious, goofy train wreck of an origin story most definitely has the courage of its convictions. Alas, the film isn’t smart enough to recognize that its convictions are dumb, and it doesn’t have the goods to back them up in the first place."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"This film, with its endless copying of Assassin’s Creed camera angles and state-of-the-art bullseyes, is an ugly machine, tiring to the eye, monotonously scored, and also weirdly regressive on quite a few levels."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"Arriving just in time to win a place among the year’s worst films, Robin Hood — bursting with an entitled sense of its own non-existent coolness — falls flat on its fat one."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,A thoroughly incoherent movie salad.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"Mendelsohn's villain is boringly one-note, Eve Hewson's Marion uses an incongruous Yank accent and always looks as though she's just stepped out of the makeup trailer, F. Murray Abraham swans around in fancy cardinal's vestments looking sinister and Foxx seems pissed off that he's not somewhere, perhaps anywhere, else. As for Egerton, he's a boy doing a man's job."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,100,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire more than makes the case for this as a franchise that's going to get better as it goes, and I am genuinely excited to see how they wrap it up."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,91,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is movie escapism made with intelligence, and that doesn't come around often enough. As I sensed this movie ending I wished it wouldn't, and when it did I wanted the next one now. Take that, Bilbo."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,91,"Catching Fire is a monumental achievement, a massively entertaining crowd-pleaser that is thought-provoking and personally inspiring in all of the ways that it aspires to be."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,90,"Catching Fire is exceptional entertainment, a spectacle with a good mind and a pounding heart."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,90,"[Francis] Lawrence and his team have calibrated the entire experience for maximum engagement. And while its pleasures can’t touch the thrill of seeing the Death Star destroyed — not yet, at least — the film runs circles around George Lucas’ ability to weave complex political ideas into the very fabric of B-movie excitement."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"The result is not only a dramatic improvement over what was already an unusually smart and satisfying pop-cultural parable of insurgent 99-per-cent rebellion, but a very likely candidate for the all-time-great-sequel sweepstakes."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"Very few people will take in this spectacle of a society amusing itself to death, of “reality games” and the vapid media hysteria that surrounds them, and not draw a parallel to our own televised bread and circuses. At its best, “Catching Fire” is a blockbuster that bites the culture that made it."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,Pop-culture escapism can be thrilling when dished out by experts. Katniss is a character worth a handful of sequels. And Lawrence lights up the screen. You'll follow her anywhere.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"The screen translation of Catching Fire, the second volume of the series, offers its audience many of the elements that made The Hunger Games compelling, but adds to that by deepening the themes and emotional currents and traveling to darker destinations."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,Catching Fire makes only the occasional misstep.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,83,"As teencentric franchises go, I much prefer The Hunger Games to the blessedly expired “Twilight” films. For one thing, they employ much better actors. My favorite: Amanda Plummer, one of the best and most underused actresses in America, as one of the Quell contestants."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,83,Lawrence steps up. And her character's fierce independence provides a welcome alternative to certain vampire-fixated young-adult heroines who define themselves entirely through the attention of much-much-older men.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"With Catching Fire, director Lawrence certainly isn't afraid to bide his time and build anticipation for the truly spectacular (and tropical-tinged) Quarter Quell, patiently reestablishing crucial relationships for maximum dramatic pay-off."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s a middle chapter, for sure, but a vigorous and fast-paced one that leaves you hungry for more."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Spinning in that wedding dress, or glaring in wary repose, Lawrence catches fire on screen."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,An effective piece of melodramatic popular entertainment that savvily builds on the foundation established by the first Hunger Games movie.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Catching Fire is a great leap forward for the franchise. Seeing as it’s all about hope and what it represents, here’s hoping the next two are just as good, if not better."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"The good news is it comes very close, and does it without sacrificing its soul. Despite its sense of been-here-slayed-that, director Francis Lawrence expertly delivers thrills, ideas and spectacle."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s not just bigger, it’s better, and it bodes well for the future of the series, if not necessarily of its unlucky protagonist."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Relatively speaking, Catching Fire is terrific. Even nonrelatively, it's pretty damn good."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Defying rote heroics and sidestepping those solemn Frodoisms lurking in the role, Lawrence seeks out the complex, human and earthy in Katniss, still the beating heart and total triumph of these movies."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s a critic’s instinct to auto-praise any blockbuster that tries to do something different, but Catching Fire is so committed to carrying on the fine work started by its predecessor that the applause flows utterly naturally."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,Catching Fire looks and feels epic. Hands down it’s one of the most entertaining films of the year.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Catching Fire delivers on all the promise of Part 1 with a gutsier, tougher, better round of Games."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,79,"Everything that felt clumsy in The Hunger Games has been improved upon here. That's most apparent in the clarity of the action, but it also extends to how efficiently the film establishes so many new ensemble members."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,79,Steady-handed action is enough to elevate this film above its predecessor.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter. She is but one female, but she's the perfect antidote to the surplus of male superheroes out there."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Best in its first hour, when it concentrates on the politics and the specific horrors of Panem. It becomes more conventional in the second half and loses steam, but it's always heading somewhere."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,Catching Fire is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire is a work of thoughtful, emotionally engaging sci-fi — everything that its predecessor The Hunger Games was not."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire has the bonus of a genuinely charismatic performer at its center. Jennifer Lawrence, now an Oscar winner thanks to ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" emotes like crazy throughout ""Catching Fire,"" but you never catch her acting."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Like too many franchise installments, Catching Fire builds to more of an ellipsis than a period, teasing the next chapter instead of providing closure. But isn’t that true of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as well? At least casual fans will only have to wait a year, not three, to see what happens next in this galaxy not so far away."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire is bigger, better and broodier than the first film."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Yes, it’s the middle chapter and feels like it, but it’s never dull."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Francis Lawrence imbues the source material with visceral pleasure in well-wrought scenes vacillating between elaborate spectacle, breathtaking terror, and--occasionally--surprising beauty."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Insofar as Catching Fire does ignite, the match to the flame is Jennifer Lawrence, who gives Katniss layers she lacks even in the books’ fairly rich characterization."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Catching Fire isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Catching Fire suffers from the movie equivalent of middle-book syndrome: The story is wayward and rangy, on its way to being something, maybe, but not adding up to much by itself. Still, it’s entertaining as civics lessons go, and it’s a more polished, assured picture than its predecessor."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"This is a safe, serviceable, carefully crafted action drama in which the subversive seeds planted in the first story take welcome root."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,67,"Lawrence gives the same committed, heart-rending performance, and she’s even more saintly than before: The script never lets her fire an arrow except in self-defense, and she stubbornly defies Snow in public, though she knows the probable consequence is death. Hutcherson has more personality this time, yet Peeta doesn’t deepen as a character."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,67,"The Hunger Games franchise, both in print and onscreen, has been exceptionally clever about cozying away imaginative space for fans to fill in the blanks and cast themselves in the rich drama. That this latest film leaves us hungering for more only means that it’s working."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,Everyone hits their marks with gusto and believability in Catching Fire... But the engine of the entire operation is Jennifer Lawrence.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,"The ingredients are in place for a potent finale, but “Catching Fire” is watered down."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,"Crowd-pleasing and compelling, most of all because of its fiery, charismatic heroine."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,60,"A Matrix Reloaded–like cliffhanger reminds that this is only the second installment out of four (good lord), but at least the flick leaves us with more than a tinge of interest in whom the odds will favor next."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,60,"What lets the movie down is its heart, or lack thereof. The reprise of the Games introduces new adversaries (and some allies) but has exactly the same dynamic as in the first movie."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Yet, despite the good acting, the middle section of the film, set at the Capitol, is attenuated and rhythmless — the filmmakers seem to be touching all the bases so that the trilogy’s readers won’t miss anything."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Enough is enough. One good thing: The jungle scenes were shot in Hawaii, so at least they all got a paid vacation."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Deep thoughts about re-directing cynically manipulated celebrity, lump in the throat moments at people rising up against their oppressors, a couple of memorable deaths and attempts at sacrifice play as flat when there’s nothing around them to serve as contrast."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,50,"Hacking through the jungle of cliche and reservoir of bad acting in Bloodsport are some pretty exciting matches. It all boils down to a confrontation between a clean-cut noble warrior and a snorting, apish, dirty fighter. As usual, it's no contest."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,40,"Forest Whitaker's cameo adds plumage to what is otherwise a well-plucked turkey, humourless and plagued by a script full of stilted mumbo-jumbo."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,40,"Bloodsport is strictly for martial arts buffs; little is offered here in the way of plot, dialog, or acting."
Bloodsport,6.8,11806119,25,"The fight scenes are staged cleanly enough by Newt Arnold, a veteran assistant director (to Sam Peckinpah, among others) making his debut at the helm. But the contest format is hopelessly repetitive and inert, the characters would seem underdeveloped in a comic book, and the restricted setting ensures that the action will never develop any real scale or velocity. The Chinese may take it on the chin in Bloodsport, but their own movies are infinitely better."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,90,"Broccoli serves the audience a space-shuttle hijacking, a jumbo-jet explosion and a protracted wrestling match between two men who are falling from the sky without parachutes. All this happens before the opening credits. From there, it's on to gondola chases in Venice, funicular crashes in Rio and laser-gun shootouts and lovemaking in deep space. Meanwhile, beautiful women come and go, talking (ever so discreetly) about fellatio. When Broccoli lays out a feast, he makes sure that there is at least one course for every conceivable taste...The result is a film that is irresistibly entertaining as only truly mindless spectacle can be."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,88,Moonraker begins with one of the funniest and most dangerous (as well as most beautifully photographed and edited) sequences Bond has ever faced.
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,80,"The visual effects, stuntwork and other technical contributions all work together expertly to make the most preposterous notions believable. And Roger Moore, though still compared to Sean Connery, clearly has adapted the James Bond character to himself and serves well as the wise-cracking, incredibly daring and irresistible hero."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,80,"Moonraker is mercifully much better than recent Bondage, with fantastic special effects, some excellent buffery (cracks at Star Wars, Close Encounters, Clint Eastwood, to name but a few), and the usual location-hopping style that makes Versailles feel like Disneyland."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,80,"Moonraker is a movie by gadgeteers, for gadgeteers, about gadgeteers. Our age may be losing its faith in technology, but James Bond sure hasn't."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,75,"While parts of Moonraker are rather silly (a trend during Roger Moore's tenure), solid special effects, well-executed action sequences, and a strict reliance upon the ""Bond Formula"" keep this film among Moore's better entries as the British superspy."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,75,"Moonraker, the newest James Bond spectacle, is a cheerful, splashy entertainment. The curators of the Bond museum do not surpass themselves with this exhibition, the 11th in the series, but they haven't fallen down on the job either. Moonraker is a satisfying blend of familiar ingredients, from the highly polished to the barely adequate. [29 June 1979, p.C1]"
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,70,More impressive than entertaining.
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,70,"The gadgets are up to the usual Bond standards, but fancy effects do not a movie make, and 007 is less satisfying floating around in space than when his feet are more or less firmly planted on the ground."
Moonraker,6.3,70308099,50,Bond meets Star Wars in one of the series' sillier outings.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"And yet, Goldeneye proves the character's viability as a pop icon: It isn't a great movie, but it's great, preposterous fun."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"There's something a mite pathetic about our culture still clinging to 007, but it's hard to deny that this is one of the most entertaining entries in the Bond cycle, which started with ""Dr. No"" (1962)."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"This is the best bond movie since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"Most crucially, Brosnan makes the grade as 007. He handles the action capably and gets the standard quips out in a commendably straightforward way that's wry but not dismissive."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"This is the first Bond film that is self-aware, that has lost its innocence and the simplicity of its world view, and has some understanding of the absurdity and sadness of its hero."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"Also, there's more action in Goldeneye than in previous 007 entries -- enough to keep a ninety-minute film moving at a frantic pace. Unfortunately, this movie isn't ninety-minutes long -- it's one-hundred thirty, which means that fully one-quarter of Goldeneye is momentum-killing padding."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"When the action is extreme, GoldenEye is supercharged with spectacular, thundering, brain-numbing fun."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,It is both the best-looking James Bond film and the best-looking James Bond.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"The writers get the mix just about right, and first-time Bond director Martin Campbell moves things along fairly briskly."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,70,"New Bond man Brosnan can't be faulted for much. He's always been generically sexy, a sort of programmed cover boy. In this new venture, he's appropriately handsome, British-accented and suave."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,70,"Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein's script promises more fun than it delivers, slowly frittering away its store of jokes and thrills."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,63,"Still, just about everything in Goldeneye, from its rote nuclear-weapon-in-space plot to the recitation of lines that sound like they're being read off stone tablets (''Shaken, not stirred!''), has been served up with a thirdhand generic competence that's more wearying than it is exhilarating."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,60,"Mr. Brosnan, as the best-moussed Bond ever to play baccarat in Monte Carlo, makes the character's latest personality transplant viable (not to mention smashingly photogenic), but the series still suffers the blahs."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,58,Technology has squeezed character to a few measly pixels on the digital screens. Explosions have replaced dramatic climaxes.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,50,"For devotees of the genre, the bad news is the best news: Bond is back and nothing has changed except the stuntman's canvas - it's bigger than ever, duly pumped up to Schwarzeneggarian standards."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,50,"How well do Bond's established conventions survive after a third of a century's hard use, the post-cold war deglamourization of espionage and the arrival of yet another actor in the central role? The short answer is, on wobbly knees."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,88,"Director Phil Alden Robinson and his writers, Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne, do a spellbinding job of cranking up the tension, they create a portrait of convincing realism, and then they add the other stuff because, well, if anybody ever makes a movie like this without the obligatory Hollywood softeners, audiences might flee the theater in despair."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,80,"Director Phil Alden Robinson -- has done just about everything he can do to build a sleek, involving and -- for a few minutes -- terrifying movie that can get viewers past the young Ryan factor."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,80,"Smartly directed, grown-up film of ideas -- with a debonair script by Paul Attanasio (Donny Brasco) and Daniel Pyne."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,"All told, it's a reasonably effective movie, but it might have been a lot more effective had it the guts to portray a Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden-like character as its villain instead of this rather unbelievable, but more politically correct, gaggle of cardboard neo-Nazis."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,A middlebrow hybrid that should satisfy most fans of spy movies without blowing them away.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,"The movie does what all good thrillers should do -- provide enough shocks and surprises to keep us guessing, and never lets up on the suspense until the end credits arrive."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,75,"Impossible to watch passively. It may be a work of pure fiction, with the requisite preposterous plot turns, but it still has the air of a ''what if?'' scenario, and it is perfectly, thoroughly chilling."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,70,Screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne stick to Clancy's sure-fire formula -- building tension from the political infighting behind a worsening crisis.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,70,"Has vast scope, unflagging energy, a rousing Jerry Goldsmith score and a horrendous disaster sequence that conveys much in discreet fashion in keeping with post-Sept. 11 sensibilities yet is needlessly evasive in telling us the precise extent of its magnitude."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,70,"Smart, complex, and engrossing idea-driven action thriller."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,67,"The tension is so plausibly high that you're eager to see how it winds up. Eager enough, in fact, to forgive Jack Ryan for reversing the aging process and winding up as Ben Affleck."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,67,"A world-detonation thriller, at once urgent and lazy, that benefits from its connection to current events and also, by the end, suffers from it."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,63,The sum of all snores until the moviemakers start blowing up Baltimore halfway through. Then the special-effects people take over for about 20 breathless minutes.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,60,"At once too real for escapism and too ridiculous for a credible espionage thriller, The Sum Of All Fears unfolds like a cruel joke and treats imagined human tragedy as the punchline."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Fortunately, even when star and story are ineffectual, Fears' supporting players are all thrilling, especially Morgan Freeman."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Mediocre terrorist melodrama turned even punier by real-life events, and that's before we scratch our heads at its lead-actor choice."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Yet there's no getting around one awkward fact. The picture, which turns on a cataclysmic act of terrorism within U.S. borders, was made for a different audience from the one that's about to see it."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"How's this for frightening: The casting of the lightweight Ben Affleck as a CIA agent who holds the fate of the entire world in his pretty-boy hands. Can't deny it, that got my heart pumping like a bunny."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"And then there's Liev Schreiber as CIA operative John Clark. With less than 30 minutes of screen time, he's everything Affleck isn't - magnetic, clever, and delightful to watch. If only the filmmakers had possessed the courage to cast the splendid Schreiber instead of the feeble Affleck."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Should carry all the urgency of a film that captures, magnifies and elaborates on the anxieties of its time. Luckily, that movie has already been made: It's called ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and it's available at a video store near you."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"It's a striking measure of the nervousness of the country right now that a movie so full of holes should be as gripping as it is, at least for its first two-thirds, after which it collapses into a swamp of sentimental mush."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,"Feels awfully rushed, as Ryan flies from the Ukraine to Moscow to the Russian hinterlands and back to Baltimore to make sweet, sophomore agent love to his physician girlfriend (Moynahan). It has the feel of one of 007's globe-hopping adventures, but without any of that franchise's giddy sense of fun."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,50,Film's real sticky wicket is that the bad guys not only threaten to nuke a major American city but do it — a conceit that might have been more amusing before terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center using hijacked commercial jets. Witnesses said the WTC attack looked like a movie; they didn't say it was a movie they wanted to see.
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"As a spy film, The Sum of All Fears is flaccid, and as an expose of nuclear threats, there's not enough information."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"Surprisingly uninvolving, the least effective of Neufeld's Clancy-based movies. Surely he was not looking for this kind of film: one that bombs literally and figuratively."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"Movie has been upstaged by the sum of our fears. The staunch heroics, frantic presidential huddles, and hairbreadth rescues all seem tinny and escapist, too Cold Warrior–ish, for what's really going on now."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,40,"Isn't a serious attempt to deal with our vulnerability to terrorism, or to address how established channels of power can bring us to the brink. It's the same damn Tom Clancy picture that's been churned out since ""The Hunt for Red October,"" as humorless and gray and dour as its predecessors."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,38,"A moribund attempt to exhume the Jack Ryan techno-thriller franchise with a severely miscast Ben Affleck, is truly the 20-megaton bomb among this summer's blockbusters."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,30,"How the hell did Ben Affleck, 29, wind up replacing Harrison Ford, 59, as our hero? Who's next as Ryan -- Ozzy Osbourne's guppy son, Jack? Chronology hasn't been this royally fucked with since Memento."
The Sum of All Fears,6.4,118907036,30,The jerry-rigged result is a trite espionage thriller without the thrills but with a lingering measure of nausea.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,100,"Dares to present a flat-out heroic president, without the safety net of irony. It succeeds."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,100,"Ford makes such a dynamic president in Air Force One, you may find yourself favorably weighing his odds in Iowa and New Hampshire."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,100,Director Wolfgang Petersen puts such a fresh spin on the familiar that it all works like gangbusters.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,90,"Fulfils all its early promise, delivering a well oiled, no-nonsense, supremely entertaining crowd pleaser."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,88,A meat-and-potatoes American thriller that means business all around the world.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,Viewers looking for old-fashioned movie thrills as a change of pace from the glut of alien and digital-oriented features might paradoxically enjoy the feeling of being back on terra firma with this airborne adventure.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,"Takes its absurd premise and keeps itself narrowly focused, pushing its heroic cast through obstacle after obstacle."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,"Think of this as ""Die Hard"" in a suit, with an election coming up."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,80,"Peterson's film is a huge, loud beast of a film, filled with gunfire, explosions, and not a few tears. It's all grounded, however, in Ford's gritted-teeth performance as President Marshall."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,75,"Petersen ratchets the tension up to a level where the viewer is likely to forget the imbecilic plot contrivances that have gotten the situation to this point, and just enjoy the action and adventure."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,75,"A fairly competent recycling of familiar ingredients, given an additional interest because of Harrison Ford's personal appeal."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,70,"The first 20 minutes of Wolfgang Petersens new action adventure, Air Force One, are so thrillingly choreographed (and so very, very loud), its all the more disappointing that the balance of the movie tends to move less like a Stealth bomber and more like a jalopy  jerking fitfully from plot hole to plot hole, only occasionally finding momentum."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,67,"The film's biggest flaw -- aside from the lapses of credibility, which are almost obligatory in escapist summer movies -- is that it flies on and on until its power to hold us simply peters out."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,63,"Trapped uncomfortably between its higher aspirations and the demands of genre, this picture never quite gets its bearings, but it's still a solid ride."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,63,"The movie wastes a good opportunity to look at important questions, such as who's responsible for American policy when the president is busy killing terrorists."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,60,"An over-the-top thriller, too loosely tethered to reality to be a lesson about anything other than the limits of popcorn consumption."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,60,The picture's attempt to satisfy the aggressive fantasies of a graying white-male audience is weirdly fascinating. It's something you don't see every day: a geriatric comic book.
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,50,"Wolfgang Petersen and writer Andrew Marlowe, apparently afraid to really make fun of any American icons, challenge us to take the story straight no matter what, but the only thing this ponderous movie has going for it is its unintentional humor."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,50,"There's not a single thing about Air Force One to recommend, except perhaps the controlled performance of Glenn Close, who does remarkably well as the recipient of several phone calls from the sky."
Air Force One,6.5,172956409,50,"If you've ever sat in a jet waiting on the runway, feeling it lumbering along in place and then bucking and shaking when it's cleared for take-off, you know what it's like to sit through Air Force One."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,75,"Four Brothers works as an urban thriller, if not precisely as a model of logic."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,75,Preposterous yet solidly entertaining.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,75,"If you can overcome the graphic nature of its casual violence, it is a lot of fun. The banter among the brothers is well-written and has a genuine fraternal feel to it. And the chases and shootouts have a fresh malevolence to them."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"With equal measures of rock-the-house vigor and in-your-face attitude, Four Brothers proves usually potent and consistently enjoyable as an old school approach to what might best be described as the urban-Western genre of slam-bang, balls-out action-revenger."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"It's a finely tuned Motor City engine: The action, including a nighttime car chase through a blinding snowstorm, is fast, brutal and efficient; the Motown soundtrack never cuts out; and as a gangster called Sweet, the British-Nigerian actor Chiwetel Ejiofor gives an electrifying performance."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"Wahlberg, whose Bobby is the kind of guy who enters a room gun first, swinging a can of a gasoline, is the glue that holds everything together; he's perfectly cast and has never given a more persuasive performance."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,70,"Gripping: Even when it wobbles off-track, it has some juice to it."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,Proficiently made trash.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"Easily the best 1975 B-movie made in 2005, Four Brothers is a raucously entertaining vigilante film."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"True, John Ford and John Wayne did this stuff a lot better back in the day, but they're not around anymore. John Singleton is, and it's nice to see someone caring enough to keep the tradition alive."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"A faux-low-budget revenge thriller, pure and simple. There's nothing special about it, and that's what's refreshing."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,63,"What holds us are the actors, including Terrence Howard as a cop who grew up with the brothers."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,60,"A typically energetic urban action melodrama, offering car chases, beatings, murders, a dog mauling, attempted arson, frequent double-crosses and pitched street battles worthy of Fallouja."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,60,It’s more than adequate as an old school action movie slightly updated for modern audiences.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,60,"Heavy-handed in places and bad news for the Detroit Tourist Commission, this is still a slick, fun ensemble piece and a step back in the right direction for Singleton."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,58,"The casting is hit-and-miss. OutKast's Benjamin and ""Troy's"" Hedlund are weak, but Gibson is very appealing and the movie powers along on a strong lead performance by Wahlberg, who has never seemed more confident, commanding or scruffily charismatic."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"If you take any of this seriously, you are not going to enjoy the movie very much. But as an absurd riff on baadasssss gangsta movies, Four Brothers has an undeniable visceral kick."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"The movie's not great, but Mom might like it."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"For all its well-drawn lines between good and evil, Four Brothers is ultimately passive entertainment."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"Four Brothers immediately joins the Good Idea, Bad Execution club. Hardly anyone seems to care about its believability - not director John Singleton, writers David Elliott and Paul Lovett or some lackadaisical actors."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"This is the kind of scrappy Seventies-throwback B-movie that fits the bill when you desperately need to see regular-seeming, occasionally inept people rise up against our corrupt criminal oppressors and cudgel them with pool cues and bits of blasted-off brick."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"More action directors should include scenes such as the Mercers' extended Thanksgiving dinner, which fleshes out the bond between the brothers without using too many words."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,50,"What results is unremarkably schizophrenic--half gritty sojourn into the inner-city furnace, half Hollywood brain death."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,40,"Atmospheric, propulsive and ultimately preposterous melodrama."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,40,"Loud, stupid, unrealistic, overdone, without a thought in its ugly little head and kind of enjoyable."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,38,"Singleton's sloppiest, laziest movie to date, springing to life in fits and starts, risibly mawkish and occasionally gripping, and often feeling like it was made up on the set."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,38,The director's approach is far too ham-fisted and erratic to bring Four Brothers up to the level of enjoyable trash -- it's too crummy to earn that distinction.
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,25,"Because the script, riddled with verbal ugliness by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, sends the movie to a series of arbitrary nowheres, the final showdown for the Mercer boys and their enemies is just as meaningless and sense-deadening."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,20,"Four Brothers regresses into gallows comedy, rampant misogyny, and one preposterous Hollywood action setpiece after another."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,20,"A career low for Mark Wahlberg and director John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood), this ridiculous mean-streets adventure starts out like a Hell's Kitchen melodrama from the 30s and eventually spins off into a series of gunfights, beat downs, and trite Motown numbers."
Four Brothers,6.9,74494381,12,"Four Brothers? Ringling Brothers is more like it, because John Singleton's latest stinks like something the elephants left behind. It's not clear what the film is trying to do, but it seems safe to guess that it's doing it wrong."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,80,"Aside from the plot -- and if you can figure out the plot, the CIA's special projects unit wants to talk to you -- Cop II is a rarity: a sequel that's as good as the original, if not better."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,75,"The new film has at least some of its predecessor's appeal. But it can't match the first film's novelty, or recapture the excitement of watching a great comic character like Axel Foley as he first came to life."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,63,"There is an inherent problem about any sequel that too slavishly duplicates the style and substance of its predecessor; it cannot deliver the delight of discovery that the original provided. Axel made a swell first impression, but he is still living on it, perhaps not yet a bore, but not quite as fascinating as he once promised to be."
Beverly Hills Cop II,6.5,153665000,60,Part 2 seems even more like a Stallone vehicle than the first movie. I'm not even sure it's intended as a comedy. It's filled wall to wall with the kind of routine action and violence that Hollywood extrudes by the yard and shrink-wraps to order.
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,90,"It is one continuous fight sequence from opening scene to final credits, but lacks the blood, profanity, and gore that would have merited a more adult rating."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,75,"The movie's extensive martial arts sequences, in which combatants bounce off each other doing triple handsprings, suggest a slightly more earthbound version of the aerial ballets in Hong Kong action-adventure films."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,70,"But where others have sunk in the mire of imitation, director Paul Anderson and writer Kevin Droney effect a viable balance between exquisitely choreographed action and ironic visual and verbal counterpoint."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,70,"Expect lots of earsplitting music, garish visuals and badly staged martial arts action."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,63,"A mix of martial-arts and special-effects magic, the film serves its nonstop confrontations either straight up or with a twist (as when they involve Kombatants with special powers, like Sub-Zero, Reptile and Scorpion)."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,60,"The filmmakers try to solve the problem of turning an experience which merely consists of a series of fights into a story by... ignoring it, presenting a film which merely consists of a series of fights."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,60,"And although director Paul Anderson treats the story with appropriate deadpan respect, there are enough sparks of humor (particularly generated by Linden Ashby as a shallow martial-arts actor who worries that he's a fake, with good reason) to amuse the adults accompanying the 10-year-old boys in the audience."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,58,"It is, in essence, the video game transferred part and parcel to the screen, and very well at that."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,50,"Mortal Kombat the movie has everything a teenage boy could want: snakes that jut out of a villain's palms, acrobatic kung- fu fighting and a couple of battling babes. Everything, that is, but an interesting plot, decent dialogue and compelling acting"
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,50,But soon the movie falls flat under an uninspired good-versus-evil plot and pathetically simpleminded dialogue.
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,75,"A viewer might expect the film’s widescreen, busy images to fill with revenge-action sequences. But in its own way, Mr. Six is much more about a unique man adjusting an out-of-fashion personal code for a new type of crisis in the shadow of his mortality."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,70,"Scored to a beautiful, introspection-oriented saxophone score, Mr. Six surprises by attempting to delve behind Feng’s sometime-inscrutable facade, rather than pushing its leading man toward action."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,70,"Staying just on the serious side of funny, Feng’s Mr Six is a fine, savoury creation."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,60,Where Guan excels is in straight dramatization.
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,58,"Plotted with limited imagination and directed with atypical flatness, Mr. Six features a strong central performance and shares its humanistic concern with Hu Guan’s previous work but is nevertheless an artistic underachiever."
Lao pao er,7.1,1415450,40,"The baggy 137-minute story drowns out Mr. Feng’s assorted sharp moments with hoary family drama and clumsy plotting, and Li Yifeng is generic as Mr. Six’s son."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,78,The Rocketeer is a gung-ho all-American summer flick with the guts not to try and be anything else.
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,75,"The movie lacks the wit and self-mocking irony of the Indiana Jones movies, and instead seems like a throwback to the simple-minded, clean-cut sensibility of a less complicated time.  That doesn’t mean The Rocketeer is not entertaining. But adjustments are necessary to enjoy it."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,75,"The Rocketeer may not be perfect, but it's an excellent example of how to adapt a comic book to the screen."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,70,"Newcomer Campbell exhibits the requisite grit and all-American know-how, but the lead role is written with virtually no humor or subtext. Those around him come off to better advantage, notably Dalton as the deliciously smooth, insidious Sinclair; Sorvino and Alan Arkin, with the latter as the Rocketeer’s mentor; Terry O’Quinn as Hughes; and the lovely, voluptuous Connelly."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,60,The Rocketeer is low-octane Steven Spielberg — projected in the right happy direction but lacking the gritty accelerant and around-the-edges humor and humanity of other heavy popcorn-load adventures.
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,50,The Rocketeer is mostly an example of pop moviemaking at its most derivative.
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,40,"Take an uncharismatic leading man (Bill Campbell), an obviously pre-Oscar Jennifer Connelly, a scene-chewing Timothy Dalton and action that doesn't start until halfway through the film and what you have is one of 1991's more disappointing summer flicks."
The Rocketeer,6.4,46704056,40,"A movie that looks nice and moves along efficiently, but offers little reason for anyone to watch."
American Ninja,5.4,10499694,50,"Ridiculous scripting and frequently comical budget limitations make this film a mostly awful trip to Bruce Lee Land, though the fight scenes, choreographed by Mike Stone, a karate champion and former partner of Chuck Norris, are spectacular and not as silly as the usual Hong Kong product. For fans of the genre only."
American Ninja,5.4,10499694,40,"Director Sam Firstenberg stages the numerous action scenes well, but engenders little interest in the non-story."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,60,"Managing to transcend the formulaic plot are Frewer and Bergin, whose performances make the film work. Frewer, reunited with his “Max Headroom” director, Farhad Mann, veers from the real — and still somewhat dull-witted — Jobe to the megalomaniacal virtual Jobe without missing a beat."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,50,"Darting around a futuristic Los Angeles on motor scooters that can fly, these plucky whiz kids are so indomitably cheery that they seem more mechanical than the demented cyber-messiah who tries to destroy them. At least he has a temper."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,50,"Two points save ""Lousy 2"" from the absolute abyss. One is a couple of imaginative touches in the art design: Cori drives an old Citroen, and a couple of Vespa-like motor scooters are briefly glanced. The other is the performance of Frewer, who played the lead in TV's ""Max Headroom."" He endows the character with more sardonic humor than we have a right to expect from the junky script by TV-oriented director Farhad Mann."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,50,"All in all, this is not a Jobe well done."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,38,"This time around, expect more of the same -- a tedious, muddleheaded tale about a malevolent spirit haunting cyberspace -- with somewhat tastier special effects."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,38,"Having jettisoned all but one of the original cast, this cynical sequel retreads familiar ground, provoking both disorientation and déjà vu."
Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,2.4,2409225,38,"Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace is a bad movie, wrongheaded in its concept and empty in its execution."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,83,"Once you accept that he (Neeson) has the badge and gun, you’re in for an exciting trip."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,83,"Part locked-room mystery, part political allegory, Non-Stop is one of the most purely enjoyable entries in the ongoing cycle of Liam Neeson action-thrillers."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,75,It’s all fairly entertaining and eminently disposable.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,75,"Non-Stop mostly works by being aware of what other jet-in-jeopardy flicks have done before, adding a spin here and there. Nothing Hitchcockian but more ambitious than a Neeson action flick needs to be."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,75,"There’s a good measure of comedic relief doled out between the action sequences, e.g., Neeson coming up with an ingenious plan to placate the passengers when they’re on the verge of a rebellion. This is a movie that knows it’s not to be taken too seriously."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,75,"The movie's fun. And now, thanks to our annual Neeson thriller, spring can come soon."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,75,"Once again Neeson is a straight-faced secret weapon. With his lion's roar and can-do fists, he grounds the film's more preposterous moments and makes them feel excitingly tense. At a certain point either you'll fasten your seat belt and go with Non-Stop's absurd, Looney Tunes logic or you won't."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,75,"Non-Stop isn't exactly a smooth ride, but as far it being the big screen equivalent of an airplane novel, one that you read on the flight and throw away when you get to your destination, it is wildly successful. Just don't think too hard about it."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,73,"A relatively high-flying adventure, injecting the always-entertaining airplane-set thriller with some fresh thrills and a cadre of characters worth getting invested in."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,70,"Non-Stop is a crisp, efficient thriller that benefits greatly from the intangibles Neeson can be counted on to supply."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,70,"Non-Stop doesn’t make any sense, but that’s expected, uninteresting and incidental to the pleasures of a slow-season Liam Neeson release as diverting as this one."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,"If I wanted to read my way through a film that features words dancing around the screen as if they were waltzing Post-Its, I would have sat through a foreign movie with subtitles instead."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,Non-Stop plays like what might happen if Michael Bay directed a screenplay developed for Alfred Hitchcock.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,"While it takes stabs at realism, mostly in its use of cellular and computer technology, disbelief must be suspended for full immersion in this twisty airborne thriller."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,"Writers John W. Richardson, Chris Roach, and Ryan Engle bet that the central hook — Who’s the bad guy? How’s he doing this? — will keep us paying attention. And they’re right."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,"Luckily, Non-Stop has a way-above-average cast for this kind of nonsense."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,Non-Stop: It is what it is.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,"Collet-Serra, who directed Neeson in “Unknown,” has a knack for keeping things lively and moving forward. There are moments of humor, gripping action and real terror."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,63,The latest collaboration between director Jaume Collet-Serra and star Liam Neeson is made with far more care and visual detail than you might expect.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,"The key to a good B-mystery is that all the actors should be a little stilted. You should never know the difference between an actor acting badly and an actor doing a masterful acting job of someone acting badly. In Non-Stop, there is much excellent bad acting."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,"It keeps you guessing, it keeps the tension ratcheted up, and it offers a dose of breathless -- if sometimes brainless -- suspense."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,"It's Liam Neeson at his Neesoniest, and yet another entry in his expanding late-career bloom into gruff and commanding action hero."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,The best twist is how Neeson’s growly presence makes a bumpy ride enjoyable.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,"Non-stop is the flimsiest of black box recorders, by contrast, that never threatens to make even intermittent sense, but it hangs together on the bulky shoulders of its star."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,"Would that the climax lived up to the tension-filled first two thirds. Let’s just say that Non-Stop reaches for some pointed post-9/11 political commentary that almost entirely exceeds its grasp. Total brainlessness, in this case, would have been a virtue."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,60,"Even in the movie’s most ridiculous moments, Collet-Serra keeps the pacing brisk and knows how to divert our attention with a well-timed bit of comic relief."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,It's a completely average film that makes a few terrible choices.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"Shot in grainy, unflattering closeups occasionally alleviated by flashily edited fight scenes, Non-Stop is no more or less than what it intends to be: the kind of midlevel brainless entertainment you might watch, between meals and naps, on an international flight. Try to enjoy the ride — and no texting, please."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"Non-Stop gets increasingly far-fetched as the jet makes its way across the Atlantic. Certainly, there are more red herrings on the plane than there are in the sea below. And Neeson has to stare down every last one of them."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"Much of the fun is awfully silly. The story strains logic, as well as credulity. It's been cobbled together, often crudely, from pieces of classic predecessors. (Here snippets of Hitchcock, there stretches of ""Speed,"" with wings on the bus.) Yet the silliness parades itself in a spirit of cheerful self-awareness, while Liam Neeson fills the thrill quotient impressively as an air marshal."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"Thanks to him (Neeson), I not only enjoyed Non-Stop, but I'd watch it again. Particularly on a plane."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"Neeson’s innate dignity can often serve as a gravitational force for movies this ludicrous, but in a cabin filled with so much flying debris, he is but an ineffectual paperweight."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"A constant low-boil of ridiculousness both mocks and sustains Non-Stop, a jerry-rigged terror-on-a-plane thriller with a premise so far-fetched as to create a degree of suspense over how the writers will wriggle out of the knot of their own making."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,50,"Non-Stop is a solid, workmanlike action picture that builds slowly, bends over backwards to over-explain itself and its villain, and delivers a lulu of an ending."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,40,"As suspicion shifts from passenger to passenger, the film starts to resemble a parlor-room whodunit, while logic becomes its first fatality. Fasten your seat belts before takeoff, because Non-Stop is a bumpy ride."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,40,"There’s no rescuing Non-Stop from its own worse impulses. The likable Neeson’s implausible second act as an action star continues, but not in a believable direction."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,40,"A nifty lift-off and a tense first hour lead us, disappointingly, to a very bumpy landing. While Neeson and co. do their best, the script just doesn’t deliver where it really matters."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,40,"In the end, Non-Stop is a waste of a perfectly good Neeson, and of our time and goodwill. Please make it stop."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,25,"From the evidence presented here, this film's three screenwriters have not only never taken a commercial flight, they've never met any actual human beings.  The details of air travel and human behavior are equally foreign to the film."
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,25,All the tedium of an endless trans-Atlantic flight gets packed into the 105 minutes of Non-Stop.
Non-Stop,7.0,92168600,20,"Non-Stop is weak sauce, a cheapie snoozer that not even heavyweights like Neeson and Moore can save."
Kickboxer,6.4,14697005,63,"Nobody goes to these movies for their comic-book plots, klutzy dialog, or hammy acting--all of which Kickboxer has in abundance. They go for action, and on that level Kickboxer delivers the goods."
Kickboxer,6.4,14697005,50,"This may not be the dumbest action picture of the year, but it's not for lack of trying. Insurmountable plot implausibilities, rampant racial stereotyping, superfluous nudity and inhuman amounts of comically exaggerated violence--""Kickboxer"" has it all."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,80,"Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film. For some reason, this appears to leave more room for the sort of random funny business that Mr. Murray and his friends do best, or to which they react with most aplomb."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,80,"Ghostbusters II is babyboomer silliness. Kids will find the oozing slime and ghastly, ghostly apparitions to their liking and adults will enjoy the preposterously clever dialog."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,80,"Here, the comedy breathes, and the illusion that it's not a factory-assembled product (which it most certainly is) is a nifty one. For a major studio blockbuster, the thing is darned chummy, and above all, that rare, modest thing, a good show."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,70,"Everything and everyone you liked in the original are there. But GB II often seems like ""Ghostbusters: The Preview Reel, Extended Mix,"" with its rather see-through buffet of special effects, comic bits and music-video transitions."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,70,"Rather wan in its anything-goes spirit of invention, the movie has a surprisingly low number of laughs; some of the initial premises are good, but there's very little energy in the follow-through, and this time Murray's listlessness seems more anemic than comic."
Ghostbusters II,6.5,112494738,63,"Ghostbusters II is such a lazy effort that the formula machinery is laid bare for all to see. It suffers from writing that is obvious, sloppy, and unimaginative."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,70,"The narrative goes a bit over the top in the second half, but it's after a large dose of the best kind of escapist good humour."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,70,"Convoy has one huge advantage over the song that inspired it: It’s one thing to hear about a mighty convoy, but it’s quite another to see it. There’s a certain tacky, truck-stop grandeur to witnessing so many huge vehicles traveling together like a pack of steel, gasoline-fueled animals."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,70,"At its best, the film finds Peckinpah moving into a new poetry of non-violence, of movement associated with explicit, actualized harmony, but the director doesn’t trust himself, mistaking change of form for impersonal commercial stewardship."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,63,"It looks like a potboiler: only a few of Peckinpah's themes are present, and they're mostly left undeveloped. But Peckinpah can still stage a fight scene better than anyone, and the film establishes its own crazy rhythm as it runs off wildly through most of the southwest."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,63,"A noisy but enjoyable destruction derby of a film, sadly with none of the subtlety, invention or skill of Spielberg's Duel."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,60,"Sam Peckinpah’s Convoy starts out as Smokey and the Bandit, segues into either Moby Dick or Les Miserables, and ends in the usual script confusion and disarray, the whole stew peppered with the vulgar excess of random truck crashes and miscellaneous destruction."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,50,"The movie is a big, costly, phony exercise in myth‐making, machismo, romance-of-the-open-road nonsense and incredible self‐indulgence."
Convoy,6.3,45000000,50,"Kristofferson's performance is as monotone as his singing, showing few changes in dramatic emphasis. Unmotivated story riddled with confusion and disarray."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,88,"The best thing about this movie is that you believe in the relationship. Hart and Johnson are a classic comedy duo in the tradition of Abbott & Costello, Bob Hope & Bing Crosby and Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,75,"Central Intelligence is genuinely funny, intriguingly plotted, and quite frankly one of the biggest surprises of the year."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,75,What makes Central Intelligence appealing in appalling times is volcanic chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,70,"Central Intelligence won’t blow you out of the theater, but you might be surprised at how well it works — how genuinely funny it is — given the familiarity of this concept."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,70,"Central Intelligence is dumb in all the right ways, and also a bit smarter than you might expect."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,67,"Central Intelligence manages to be a far more coherent comedy than I would have expected, and it’s a worthy representation of the genre."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,Central Intelligence is actually funny.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,There’s such a genuine sweetness to Johnson you can’t help digging the shtick.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,"Central Intelligence won’t win any points for originality, but that doesn’t make it any less funny."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,"It dawdles between action beats and big laughs, and in the third act, that lets much of the wind out of it."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"There may not have been such an awkwardly homoerotic bromance-seduction on film since Jim Carrey molested Matthew Broderick in The Cable Guy, but it’s one of Central Intelligence’s redeeming features that it’s generously forgiving, rather than nastily phobic, of Bob’s quirks."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,This is a much better comedy than it is an action movie.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"You come to this movie hoping that Johnson and Hart make you laugh. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don’t. The hit-to-miss ratio is higher than you might expect, and both actors could accurately be described as pleasant, if not especially creative."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"Thank the movie gods for Dwayne Johnson, who delivers a performance of such charm, such unexpected goofiness that the screen practically glows every time he appears."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"The result, while instantly forgettable, is a fundamentally pleasurable experience."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"Central Intelligence demonstrates an above-average interest in story and character, and tries, if not always successfully, to craft real comic situations and action sequences. It's been made with a certain level of polish and professionalism. And it capitalizes on the chemistry between Hart and Johnson."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"Nearly (but not quite) redeemed by its good nature and the megaton charisma of its two stars, Central Intelligence is a dopey blockbuster diversion that will surely keep United Airlines passengers entertained during the dog days of summer."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"While not necessarily a diamond-in-the-rough itself, Central Intelligence proves that Johnson has always been at the center of his own ring, in more ways than one. It just took the rest of us (and Hollywood) a little longer to notice."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"Central Intelligence doesn’t feel like the birth of a great comic duo — more like a blind date that goes a little better than expected. The chemistry’s not there yet, but let’s give it another shot."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"By the time the film reaches its obvious conclusion – by the time Hart expends more energy than Bugs Bunny, by the time the espionage plot twists itself into corners too convoluted for even ""Homeland"" fans, by the time Thurber exhausts the audience by unleashing cameo after cameo – it’s only Johnson who remains standing tall."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"The film itself is painless, strained, occasionally amusing, and utterly disposable — just another studio buddy comedy/action movie that forgot where it put the script."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"It’s straightforward, it’s pretty funny and it stars two good actors who seem to be trying really hard to leave audiences satisfied."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,Central Intelligence always takes the lazy way out. You go along for the ride because Hart and Johnson promise something they can't deliver: a movie as funny as they are.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"While it fails to deliver convincing action and its comedy feels watered down, Central Intelligence does get the “buddy” aspect correct. Doing their best with a script (also by Ike Barinholtz and David Stasser) that feels all-too-safe, Johnson and Hart manage to prove that a movie can glide by just enough on sheer charisma alone."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"The blend of Johnson’s laid-back hero-dudeness and Hart’s whippet-fast comic timing should have been good fun. But somebody, alas, had an idea, though not a good one: Make Johnson the comedian and Hart the straight man."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"It delivers — on some basic, giddy, turn-off-your-frontal-lobes level. It’s an action-comedy utensil, like “Rush Hour” crossed with an old Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot-’em-up, with a few goofy added sprinkles of “Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion.”"
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,It's a pity that no one else involved in the making of the film had Dwayne Johnson's sly intuition.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,42,"Any time the duo build up a significant amount of energy, the messy mechanics of the story come barreling in, shifting the narrative attention to the tedious developments involving encryption keys, which is nothing more than a Macguffin to begin with."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,42,"That it manages to score a good laugh every couple of minutes is mostly a credit to stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, who make for a better mismatched-buddy comic duo than the movie probably deserves."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,An action comedy without any action or comedy – not even The Rock’s charisma and enthusiasm can save this dud.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,Even the obligatory blooper reel after the film isn’t as funny as it should be.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,An odd-couple caper of staggering dopeyness that makes you long for the snap and sizzle of the buddy movies of the 1980s.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,"A throwaway film that in all the worst ways give summer movies a bad name: told by idiots, full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing but first-weekend grosses."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,38,"Central Intelligence is one of those slick, gunplay-riddled, stupidly plotted, aggressively loud buddy movies — so formulaic and dumb, even if you see it you’ll probably forget you’ve seen it by the end of the year...And if that’s the case, consider yourself fortunate."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,25,"With its canned, predictable action sequences and mirthless attempts at humor, it displays an ineptitude that is frankly shocking considering the talent involved."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,75,"A loose, lighthearted romp that's a notch above the usual buddy comedies."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,63,"This is probably Murphy's best comedic performance since ""Bowfinger."" The adrenaline is pumping and the outrageousness is dialed all the way up. Murphy is often funny, and occasionally hilarious."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,63,"The missing ingredient, of course, is script."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,60,"No less than four screenwriters are credited, yet the script is filled with the usual clichés (hello, red digital readout!) and supposed twists that can be seen a mile away."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,60,"Between spy training and sensitivity training, the two (Murphy/Wilson) prove nicely matched comic foils."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,60,"I Spy confirms Wilson's ability to turn mediocre, mercenary endeavors into fun crowd-pleasers. Of course, Wilson starring in I Spy is like Phil Jackson coaching a junior-high basketball team, but as long as the results are this entertaining, it's doubtful audiences will care."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"TV's ''I Spy'' knew how to swing. The movie 'I Spy knows only how to scramble and string together moments of Murphy braggadocio and Wilson stoner-ocity, and the sweat shows."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"It's precisely the lineup of familiar past work that makes I Spy pretty dull goods, invigorated mainly by the sharp interplay between Murphy and Wilson, both of whom shine best when they have a sidekick to work with."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"Up against the wit and teamwork of the sparkling TV original, this lame vehicle sputters and fades."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"The movie comes to life when Murphy and Wilson are trading one-liners, and then puts itself on hold for spy and action sequences of stunning banality."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,50,"Too much of the humor falls flat. Thomas' numerous chase sequences through the streets, over the rooftops and through the airways of Budapest seem numbingly repetitive, and the script's reliance on castration gags betrays its overall lack of imagination."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,42,"The real problem with the new film, however, is a certain lack of chemistry between the leads; Wilson is game, as always, but his part is seriously underwritten, and while Murphy raises trash talking to the level of a fine art, he seems to be operating in another movie altogether."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"Spoof or tongue in cheek update, the movie squanders the lion's share of its time on tired, cartoon-quality sequences choreographed around ho-hum chases and explosions. None possess the satiric zip of Austin Powers-style parody."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"Mostly I Spy, with more dead spots than a Jerry Lewis telethon, is content to mark time. That gives us, and perhaps the cast as well, the opportunity to reflect on how satisfying this film could have been if anyone had thought it worth their while to provide real material for the talent to work with."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"Buffeted by the usual car crashes and explosions, Wilson and Murphy never develop any comic chemistry."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,40,"The sex bits are flat, the racial innuendo is flatter, and somewhere, Cosby is having a Pudding Pop and shaking his head in disbelief."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"I cry for I Spy or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind. Comas are physical, not emotional."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,Their (Murphy/Wilson) exchanges and interplay are so campy and over the top that I kept expecting them to pull out frying pans and start bopping each other over the head with them. I Spy is one just Stooge short of homage.
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"The execution is so dumbed-down, so dumbfounding, that sophisticated moviegoers might confuse it for outtakes from ""Spy Kids 2"" and ""XXX."""
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"An overblown clunker full of bad jokes, howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,38,"The movie is so thoroughly lousy. It's loud, brash and obvious, full of car chases and explosions and gunplay."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Something lazy, slow, shallow, stupid, amateurish, unfunny, unsuspenseful, uninformed, unspeakably dull and witlessly written, directed and acted (the special effects suck, too)."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,Even the handful of moments that are amusing feel recycled from old sketches of Mr. Murphy's.
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Though ample time is spent mingling Murphy's jabberjaw locutions and Wilson's curveball spaciness, the film leaves only the bitter reek of a botched chemistry experiment."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,Moves at a glacial pace.
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Exhausts you with its derivative stupidity, leaving you weak and bored and weary of comedy that's not funny, action that's not exciting, dialogue that's not clever. It's not even an adequate rip-off of the TV show."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,30,"Hollywood's Thanksgiving turkey arrives today - 27 days early - in the gobbling guise of the heavily hyped, brain-dead comedy, I Spy."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,25,"Nothing is real, but at the same time, nothing is fake. Nothing is, period. You don't believe a second of it for a second, so banal and predictable is it."
I Spy,5.4,33561137,25,"Just plain dismal, an inexplicable mining of old, mid-level programming that has all the raging excitement of continental drift."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,75,"Toy Soldiers is a crisp, suspenseful thriller well tailored to the tastes of teen-age audiences, who will doubtless appreciate such touches as the equivalent microchips found in one student's radio-controlled airplane and the chief terrorist's detonator, which is rigged to blow up the entire school."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,70,"Toy Soldiers is a very entertaining action film that updates 1981's sleeper hit Taps. Seeing Sean Astin (son of John Astin and Patty Duke) and his pranksters turn into commandos who wipe out the nasty invaders makes for purely escapist, crowd-pleasing pleasure."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,70,"The kids' attainment of self-respect and adulthood through sabotage and risky business is achieved at considerable cost, with Petrie pulling no punches in his depiction of violence. The exciting action set pieces, likewise, are staged with a verve and skill above and beyond the call of duty."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,70,"Toy Soldiers is hardly deep, but it's diverting and so are most of the actors. First-time director Daniel Petrie Jr. knows his way around this roughhouse terrain -- he wrote Beverly Hills Cop, The Big Easy and Shoot to Kill -- and while he keeps things taut, he has yet to display substance rather than style."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,60,"Toy Soldiers is little more than macho posturing for young men searching for their identities. As such the image of a beefy Astin sporting a machine gun is not especially healthy nor is it especially imaginative. There is an attempt at balance with the younger, nerdier intelligent kids having a role in their own salvation and a representative cast including kids of all colors. For those concessions and for directorial competence, I am grateful."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"It’s Dead Poets Society meets Die Hard. The movie is competent, smoothly photographed, and pretty much free of false, baby-Rambo heroics. It’s so inoffensive that you can almost overlook its central drawback — that the students don’t have much personality."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"Toy Soldiers is a movie that appeals at once to adolescent self-pity and adolescent anger-a film that takes feelings of rejection and inadequacy and transforms them into a violent revenge fantasy, directed against all those distant daddies. It's hardly the first teenpic to do so, but it's certainly one of the most thorough, the most methodical and, not coincidentally, the least fun."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"If your teenage sons are looking for heroes, send them to Toy Soldiers. Even if they're not, send them anyway. They'll probably enjoy watching a judge being thrown out of a helicopter. Too bad the judge didn't take the script with him. Most reasoning adults will probably reject this far-fetched clash between American preppies and Colombian terrorists."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"Toy Soldiers, a film with earnest performances and professional production values, is constructed out of characters, situations and gimmicks that will be instantly recognized by the weary viewer. There is nothing new here."
Toy Soldiers,6.5,15073942,50,"Unfortunately, Petrie's idea of dramatic tension is to expose more boyish flesh as the movie progresses. And as more and
more lumpy young pectorals are flashed, more and more people and objects are exploded. All this is accompanied by a persistently obnoxious soundtrack that features patriotic fanfares. And as the four different plots bump into each other like blinded laboratory animals, we begin to feel empathy if not pity for everyone involved."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,80,A modernised Bond is dragged kicking and screaming into the 70s.
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,70,"There is a marvelous escape from an alligator farm (deadly reptiles are rather a motif in this movie), a superb collection of grotesque ways of killing, and a fine sense of pace and rhythm."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,70,"Live and Let Die isn't the best of the series by far, but it's not the worst either. The fun doesn't last due to the interference of the flimsy plot, centered around one of the least threatening Bond villains ever."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,63,"It has all the necessary girls, gimmicks, subterranean control rooms, uniformed goons and magic wristwatches it can hold, but it doesn't have the wit and it doesn't have the style of the best Bond movies."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,60,"The most significant Bond ingredient missing from Live and Let Die is Q, whose gadgets still play a central role. The film also offers a few key additions, including an illuminating glimpse of Bond’s home."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,60,"Two hours long and anti-climactic, but Bond fans won't be disappointed."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,50,"Watching Live and Let Die isn't a complete waste of time, but there's no overriding reason why anyone should go out of their way to see it unless they're a die-hard Bond fan or are curious about Roger Moore's first turn in the role."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,50,"This eighth film in the Bond series marks the first appearance of Roger Moore as the superspy. Less macho than Sean Connery's Bond, Moore's fastidiously dressed 007 survives by his wits and injects more humor into the proceedings."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,40,"Guy Hamilton's direction lacks enthusiasm and pace, while even the art direction—long the Bond films' real secret weapon—seems to have fallen to a shrunken budget. Not much fun."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,50,Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on just how much 14-year-old boy you've got in ya.
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,40,"There's scarcely a whiff of originality in the zombie horror picture House of the Dead, but Uwe Boll has directed it with enough energy and style that it adds up to passably mindless if grisly fun."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,38,"Director Uwe Boll wholeheartedly embraces the film's concept, and with some fancy editing and a pulsing soundtrack, the effect really is like watching a video game."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,30,Dull and unimaginative.
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,25,Unimaginatively recycles all the teens-in-the-woods gorefest conventions.
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,25,"Somewhere between cartoonishly bad for comic effect and bad because the filmmakers didn't really give a damn, The House of the Dead is, at least, unpretentiously dumb."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,25,"House of the Dead, sadly, is so bad it's bad."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,20,"Does little more than add another title to the very long list of movies influenced by George Romero's 1968 horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."""
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,20,"Much poorly choreographed gunplay, many lovingly rendered head explosions, and some half-assed exposition about centuries-old, immortality-seeking pirates follow, with nothing to recommend House Of The Dead to anyone but the most undiscriminating zombie-movie fans."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,20,"Heres a would-be horror film that contains not one ounce of professional pride in its making, not one shred of technical competence. This is one of the worst films of recent times."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,20,Laughable performances.
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,20,Prochnow rocks; nothing else does.
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,0,"Based on a video game, far exceeds expectations -- in negative ways that inspire thoughts of less than zero stars."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,0,"To properly convey the jaw-dropping shoddiness of this videogame-based ''horror'' ''movie,'' one must approach what scientists call Absolute Stupid, a state previously thought to exist only under highly controlled laboratory conditions or at the highest levels of government."
House of the Dead,2.0,10249719,0,"Its cheese of the purest stripe, bafflingly bad to the point of being oddly charming in its brain dead naïveté."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,70,"D.C. CAB is a musical mob scene, a raucous, crowded movie that's fun as long as it stays wildly busy, and a lot less interesting when it wastes time on plot or conversation. There's a lot of talent in the large cast, and Joel Schumacher, the director, generally keeps things bustling."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,60,"D. C. Cab is not an entirely bad movie -- it has its moments -- but if it had used more actual taxi-riding incidents and more recognizable driver types, it could have been a little masterpiece."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,60,"Mindless but likable comedy about a failing Washington, DC, cab company that is revitalized when the eccentric group of cabbies work together to save it. A good cast makes the most of the uninspired material."
D.C. Cab,5.5,16134627,50,The movie's inherent flaws and jumble of subplots and side characters barely make a scratch into the stereotypes and cookie-cutter story.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,80,"Shooter is a generically titled studio action picture that turns out to be a surprisingly deft satire about Americans' loss of faith in their government following the 2000 election, the 9/11 attacks, and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Shooter does what any good thriller should accomplish - it thrills. It's fast-paced, energetic, and doesn't follow a path that seems pre-ordained from the beginning."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Wahlberg acquits himself well, and the supporting cast -- which includes pioneering rocker Levon Helm in a scene-stealing cameo as an aging gun buff who knows a thing or two about cover-ups, Ned Beatty as a corrupt politician, and a Strangelovian Rade Serbedzija -- is so strong you almost wish the film were longer so they could have more screen time."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"The movie's politics may miss their mark, but its thrills are dead-on."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Unravels a bit heading toward its finale, as buildings explode and characters are forced to explain themselves and their nefarious motives. But the payoff at the end - at once kind of radical and gratuitous - delivers a wallop."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"It's a story that can be transplanted from genre to genre, because we never grow tired of it, which is to say that it fits snugly into the paranoid drift of American movies, and the value we place on one honest man with a gun."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"If the movie only lavished as much thought and care on its characters as it does on each intricate set piece, Shooter might have been a classic."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"Carrying Shooter through its difficulties is, finally, not its crisp action sequences and definitely not the torture. It's Wahlberg's performance, which is the film's most old-fashioned element, and its best."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"This maximalist approach can tax the nerves, though it has the benefit of keeping you on alert. It’s also pretty enjoyable. Mr. Fuqua, who happens to be surprisingly good with actors, does have a knack for chaos."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"Wahlberg could be the actor that action movies have been looking for since Sly, Arnold, Harrison, Bruce, Jackie and Jean-Claude -- all in their 50s or 60s -- got too old to execute the leg lifts necessary to kick bad guys in the butt."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,67,"The timing couldn't be better for a thriller that focuses on assassination, international war scandals and U.S. agencies of enormous influence and wildly varying competence."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"Suspended over a deep gully of disbelief, where logic takes more bullets than the bad guys, Shooter still makes the grade as hard-ass action escapism."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"It does move along at a nice clip, and delivers exactly what belligerent action fans on both sides of the political aisle want -- a wholly admirable figure blowing up a lot of bad s---."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"The paranoia is as thick and luscious as that Reddi-wip, and it's served from both left and right."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,A stylish but essentially businesslike smash-and-crasher.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"Like most modern action films, Shooter is too explicit, more interested in mayhem than motive."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,60,"An immediately involving yarn of an ace Marine sharpshooter set up to take the fall for an attempted presidential assassination, picture saddles itself with stereotypical villains, hokey contrivances and too-expedient crisis solutions."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,60,The picture might be entertaining if it didn't take itself so seriously.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,58,"The film has about five endings, each sillier than the next. Before it's over, the business end of that sniper rifle looks kind of inviting."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"A screwy assassination thriller for these murky times, it takes half its pages from Soldier of Fortune and the other half from links provided by conspiracytheories-zapoppin.org."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Despite gripping chase sequences and a few awe-inspiring fiery explosions, gaping holes in the convoluted plot make Shooter heavier on style than substance."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"The story is often ridiculous, but director Antoine Fuqua provides plenty of fun distractions."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Starts out OK, but then almost seems to be intentionally going for humor."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"If this were a more serious film, its cynicism about the U.S. government would put it in a league with ""The Manchurian Candidate."" But it is simply an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick with bantamweight Wahlberg doing the heavy lifting for the preoccupied Governator."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"An intermittently preposterous, drawn-out but sometimes entertaining story about an unstoppable ex-Marine."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Though much of the action in Shooter is beautifully photographed, the movie's force is as a blunt instrument of metaphor. Shooter is a video-game-fantasy version of the 2006 midterm elections, a howl of rage at the hypocrisy of the Bush presidency and the Iraq war."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"This is the first big-studio action picture with some of the disgusted, bloody nihilism of the post-Vietnam era."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,A virtual textbook of action clichés.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,42,"The ultimate crime of this paranoid enemy-of-the-state pulp, directed with more style than brains by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), is how dull it is."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,42,"Fuqua keeps the action moving efficiently, but he doesn't know when to stop piling it on, and eventually, Wahlberg's army of one becomes more a comic-book vigilante than a righteously disgruntled patriot."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,40,"Sylvester Stallone is filming a new episode of his ""Rambo"" action series, but Mark Wahlberg has beaten him to the punch with Shooter, a preposterous gut buster that follows the formula so closely it would probably lose a plagiarism suit."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,25,"Less subversive and infinitely less intelligent than 1999’s Wahlberg-starrer ""Three Kings,"" this movie does blow lots of s--- up real good and punish contemptible public figures otherwise left unaccountable for massacring African villagers."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,"Everybody is good at one thing, they say; for Emmerich, it's destruction."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,This highly entertaining spin on eco-catastrophe could turn the most meteorologically challenged among us into Weather Channel freaks.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,"Despite the clunky bits, ""Tomorrow"" still manages to deliver the blockbuster goods."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"Yes, the movie is profoundly silly. What surprised me is that it's also very scary. The special effects are on such an awesome scale that the movie works despite its cornball plotting."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"The spectacle, which is colossal and at times staggering to behold, begins within two minutes of the fade-in and keeps coming until the finish. I thought I'd seen it all. I hadn't."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"Better than his previous films, The Day After Tomorrow plays to Emmerich's strengths, making for a thrill ride that rarely disappoints when it matters."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,70,"A disarmingly pulpy, eye-popping disaster movie during its first half, and an increasingly dull survival melodrama during its second."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,"Several of the special-effects sequences -- a Tokyo hailstorm, a system of tornadoes ripping through L.A. (and tearing up the Hollywood sign), a tidal wave breaking on the East Side and washing through the canyons of Manhattan -- are just dandy."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,"Emmerichs sense of irony has rarely been so pointed, and The Day After Tomorrow, for all its obvious cataclysmic set-pieces and stock characterizations, is nothing if not timely."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,Delivers the expected thrills and groans.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"The Day After Tomorrow is filled with bad dialogue, stock peril situations, and sketchy character development, but it's a big enough spectacle that those things don't completely derail the film's capacity to be enjoyed."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"Never mind the cool, convincing effects (and they are cool), The Day After Tomorrow teems with illogical action, improbable coincidences. It's pure escapist fare, a popcorn gobbler."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"This often entertaining movie mixes grand, epic effects and amazing visualizations of catastrophe with a sappy family-in-crisis plot that would look hackneyed in a '60s Disney TV movie."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"Disaster movies, from ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to ""Towering Inferno,"" are impossible to take seriously and ""Day"" is no exception - it's simply a fast-moving pageant of end-of-the-world eye candy."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,I'm not saying that a date with this picture is all pleasure; but it's not all guilt either.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"The real top billing, what audience-goers are obviously shelling out to see, is the computer-generated chaos, and as they should: Digital technology has caught up with our collective imaginations Now More Than Ever."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,60,The really good news is that the disaster money shots are some of the finest ever filmed.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,60,It's the Weather Channel on steroids.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,58,"A decent disaster pic comes down to the handful of colorful individuals who will live (or, depending on the prominence of their billing, die), as it has since the days of chewy disaster meatballs like ''The Towering Inferno'' and ''Earthquake.'' And the heaviest lifting in Emmerich's production falls to Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"What most hurts The Day After Tomorrow is its unfortunate, lecturing tone."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"All this amounts to a badly wasted opportunity, since global warming is a serious issue that deserves thoughtful treatment. So stay home and read a scientific journal instead. This is a disaster movie that lives up to its label."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Packed with digs at Bush-Cheney that even Democrats could find heavy-handed, the movie's lumbering approach reminds us that, OK, Emmerich did ""Independence Day"" -- but also 1998's ""Godzilla,"" which began sinking back into the sea in week two."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"The glacierization of half of the world's inhabited land is contemplated with barely a hint of horror. In fact, it looks kind of cool."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Really bad movies can be fun, and the dialogue here often attains a level of joyful inanity."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,Emmerich does know his way around an action scene -- there's an exciting sequence in which Sam and his buddies run from wolves while looking for meds inside the huge ship that pulls up alongside the library. But he's a master of disaster with no people skills. The characters in The Day After Tomorrow are fantastically stupid.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Needless to say, the movie fails as a cautionary tale. But it fulfills its summer air-conditioning duties with flippant ease, and its enjoyably cloddish attempts at political relevance add a fascinating layer of incongruity."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"The story is too silly, too woefully underwritten, to stake a claim on seriousness."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,The generally competent B-list actors are hobbled by cliché-ridden dialogue but do their best to react in remotely plausible ways each time the script nails them with some new melodramatic contrivance.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"Despite the fact that The Day After Tomorrow is harnessed to the very real threat of global warming, it's still just a big, dumb movie, another Hollywood entertainment that, instead of tweaking and teasing our brains for fun, leaves us feeling thick and stupid."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"While it's marvelously refreshing to observe Mother Nature obliterating L.A. and New York along with caricatures of ghastly world leaders, almost everything good is in the trailer, save perhaps brief run-ins with malevolent wolves and Ian Holm."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,An exceptionally stupid movie.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"Utterly shatters the illusion with a trite plot, banal dialogue, clunky sentimentality and, worst of all, a sort of narrative arbitrariness."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,"Emmerich now directs entirely in watered-down Spielbergisms, and his storytelling skills, never strong, have gone slack. His talent for stretching a concept that can be described in 10 seconds into a feature-length movie, on the other hand, remains impressive."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,"When it comes to weaving personal stories in and out of the special-effects set pieces, the director has the most colossal antitalent since Ed Wood Jr."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,The catastrophe is so pulped and exaggerated that uninformed audiences will safely assume that global warming is just a Democratic scare tactic.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,Don't ask whether or not you should take The Day After Tomorrow seriously. Don't take it at all.
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,70,It's a fun film that presents an interesting scenario and raises a unique possibility. What it lacks in depth and acting skills it more than makes up for as a thoroughly enjoyable popcorn film.
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,63,"As a documentary on the USS Nimitz, The Final Countdown is wonderful. As entertainment, however, it has the feeling of a telepic that strayed onto the big screen. The magnificent production values provided by setting the film on the world's largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier can't transcend the predictable cleverness of a plot that will seem overly familiar to viewers raised on Twilight Zone reruns."
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,60,"This is the kind of movie that some kids would probably enjoy - it's filled with technology, special effects and action. But it just doesn't make any sense. And It lacks the wit to have fun with its time travel paradoxes, as last year's wonderful Time After Time did. It just plows ahead. Or behind. Or somewhere."
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,60,Little more than a lengthy Twilight Zone episode.
The Final Countdown,6.7,16647800,50,"An idea worthy of Harlan Ellison, but disappointingly fumbled. Taylor handles most of the aircraft carrier material like a recruiting film, and though the script manages a few deft twists and turns, and even a neat final frisson, it ultimately works more on the tease level of a TV episode than as a movie."
Gator,5.8,11000000,60,"Too much of this is tedious, rather like off-cuts from his recent movies, but the reasonable photography and good action material help. Country singer Jerry Reed makes a good heavy, and when Reynolds keeps it simple, his direction suggests the makings of a modest craftsman."
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,An entertaining piece of good ol' boy fluff with plenty of car and boat chases.
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,"This follow-up to White Lightning never takes itself seriously, veering as it does through many incompatible dramatic and violent moods for nearly two hours."
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,"Structurally, Gator is a bit of a mess, largely because of the civilizing and romantic influence Reynolds has brought to the randy domain of the redneck action film."
Gator,5.8,11000000,50,"Gator is yet another Good Ol' Movie, and not, I fear, the summer's last. If only it had a Good Ol' Plot worth a damn, it might have even been a halfway tolerable ol' movie."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,60,"Morita still charms, Macchio still tightropes between petulence and raw optimism, whilst the fight scenes are competent enough to offset the woeful romantic sub-plotting."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,"With its sluggish script and unaging characters, The Karate Kid Part III has the rote sense of film makers trying to crank out another moneymaker."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,Perhaps the series is simply getting cynical and tired.
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,"After suffering endless abuse, Daniel wins with just a few well placed whacks: those expecting standard wish-fulfilment fantasy will be disappointed that (in tune with the philosophy, of course) he didn't give the punk a pasting."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,50,"Unfortunately, the pattern has so calcified that Gene Autry westerns seem like models of moral complexity by comparison."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,40,"This material is wearing out its welcome. I have mastered all of the lessons The Karate Kid movies have to teach and all of the surprises they have to spring. I am also intimately familiar with the plot formula, so that nothing in this third film comes as the faintest surprise. Perhaps it is time, as Mr. Miyagi might say, to study something else."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,38,"Although III claims seven times as much action as ever before, the movie is still so boring that even the love interest (Robyn Lively) leaves early. She's no Kung Fool."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,38,"In short, writer Robert Mark Kamen gave director Avildsen and his cast too little to work with for The Karate Kid Part III to have gone into production in the first place."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,37,"The makers of The Karate Kid Part III - also responsible for its successful predecessors - have either delivered or taken a few too many kicks to the head along the way, resulting in a particularly dimwitted film that will likely spell the death of the series."
The Karate Kid Part III,5.1,38956288,30,"More a sequel to the original than an extension of the action in Part II, The Karate Kid Part III is half-hearted and very dull."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,80,"The craftsmanship that went into the making of this film has to have been formidable, yet a key part of its enjoyment is its throwaway, unpretentious charm."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,75,"FX 2 is entertaining enough, but lacks the zip and wit of the original."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,63,"The story line is little more than a shiny hat for holding the high-tech rabbits. Still, it's an enjoyable bit of smoke and mirrors, thanks to the decency and resourcefulness of its hero."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,60,"It's all totally farfetched and skates imperturbably over several questions of logic that will spring unbidden to the most accepting mind. But it's entertaining, inconsequential fun."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,60,"There should be a special category for movies that are neither good nor bad, but simply excessive."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,"As long as it is fixated on gadgetry, FX2 is reasonably entertaining. But when the movie focuses on plot and character, it turns quite dotty in an amiable way."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,A big-screen version of a routine cop show that occasionally gets by on momentum from the original movie.
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,The movie itself is convoluted and almost unbelievably lackluster.
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,"Valiantly tries to recapture the spit and polish indie feel of the original, and comes up looking more like something Franklin might have directed on a Bad Day."
F/X2,5.8,21082165,50,"With all the ingenuity that went into toys and gadgetry in this five-years-removed sequel, it’s a shame no one bothered to hook a brain up to the plot."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,100,Jim Jarmusch has come up with something strange and amazing.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,100,"Laced with brilliantly knotted ideas on race, masculinity and cults of violence."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,91,"It's a nearly pitch-perfect melding of genres, influences and modes of expression--it's the first Mafia movie for the hip-hop age."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,90,"What makes the film so special is that while tickling your postmodern funnybone, it never forgets to make you care for its characters, in a welcome, and almost traditional way."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,90,It's the kind of movie you wish you had more time to absorb and could see more than once before reviewing.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,90,Perversely funny.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,89,The result has the dingy grace of pigeons flying across an urban wasteland.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,88,"This infusion of warrior philosophy is the gas in Ghost Dog's tank, and Jarmusch pumps it up for maximum octane throughout."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,83,Weirdly intriguing.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,80,Whitaker's acting is highly creative and Jarmusch's filmmaking is as elegant and original as ever.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,80,"(Jarmusch's) most accessible film after ""Night on Earth,"" yet it's still elliptical and enigmatic."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"It's beautifully cast and filmed (cinematography by the matchless Robby Muller) and often quite moving, despite the fact that most of the characters are never developed much beyond mythic or parodic prototypes."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"Every minute he's on screen, Whitaker makes Ghost Dog worth watching."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"(Jarmusch) seems...to introduce gratuitous bloodshed that is out of sync with the engaging, offbeat tempo and dark, comedic moral fable that has come before."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"Best when it's playful, toying with the fact that the Mafia has in a single generation been transmogrified from myth to joke."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"A movie as laconic as its hero, Ghost Dog is nonetheless diminished by its most un-Zen-like attachment to this underlying sentimentality."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,75,"There is a lot of violence, but not much action; a plot involving vengeance, jealousy and double-crossing, but not a great deal of suspense."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,70,Am I the only one who finds the substance of this movie repulsive?
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,70,Points for an interesting concept; demerits for the dull execution.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,67,The gambits in Ghost Dog seem simply like literary and cinematic games devoid of any larger meaning.
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,63,"It's too bloody to be funny and too silly to be dramatic and too self-indulgent to be anything other than what it is, one more bad movie."
Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,7.5,3308029,63,It's too cryptic and unfulfilled to serve as a tool for anything beyond its own obfuscation.
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,"In the hierarchy of great movie chase sequences, the recent landmarks include the chases under the Brooklyn elevated tracks in ""The French Connection"" down the hills of San Francisco in ""Bullitt"" and through the Paris Metro in ""Diva."" Those chases were not only thrilling in their own right, but they also reflected the essence of the cities where they took place. Now comes William Friedkin, director of ""The French Connection,"" with a new movie that contains another chase that belongs on that short list."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,"To Live and Die in L.A. exhibits a remarkable degree of kineticism, evident in several memorable chase sequences, the film’s headlong momentum abetted by Wang Chung’s dynamic score."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,"A near-masterpiece. The fashions and music and attitudes on display might have been interpreted at the time as opportunistic stabs at au courant stylization, but the film is nevertheless overpowering and otherworldly rather than quaint or kitschy. It feels like a transmission from a different planet. To Live and Die in L.A. is so of its time that you can only be captivated by it."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,100,To Live and Die in L.A. is as urgent and exhilaratingly paced as anything William Friedkin's done.
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,90,"To Live and Die in L.A. is Mr. Friedkin at his glossiest, a great-looking, riveting movie without an iota of warmth or soul. On its own terms, it's a considerable success, though it's a film that sacrifices everything in the interests of style."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,90,"Friedkin plays it as brutal and cynical as he ever did with The French Connection; and this time the car chase takes place on a six-lane freeway at the height of the rush hour, going against the traffic."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,90,To Live and Die in L.A. looks like a rich man's Miami Vice. William Friedkin's evident attempt to fashion a West Coast equivalent of his [1971] The French Connection is engrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled.
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,88,"An astonishing, brilliantly edited car chase--with pursuer and pursued speeding the wrong way along the LA Freeway--is one of many pleasures in this darkly stylish crime film, director William Friedkin's best effort since ""The Exorcist."""
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,88,"For those who enjoy indulging in an exciting, moody, stylized cop drama molded from the best of templates and carved out of '80s pop art, To Live and Die in LA is a truly great way to spend an evening."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,80,"Friedkin isn't nearly in enough control of his material for the film to qualify as an artwork, yet it's one of his few films with a real emotional current."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,75,"The main problem is that the supposed good guys are all such reprehensible toads it’s impossible to care whether they get to bring down Willem Dafoe’s charismatic, polo-necked super-crook."
To Live and Die in L.A.,7.3,17307019,70,Overheated and recklessly violent.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,91,Possibly the best war movie of the year.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,90,Danfung Dennis presents a powerful depiction of the horrors and daily violence of our ongoing war in Afghanistan.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,90,"Similar in its battlefield passages to last year's Danish-made ""Armadillo,"" Dennis' film scores a layered perspective that follows Marine Sgt. Nathan Harris into combat and back home."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,88,"In its closing scenes, Hell and Back Again builds to an emotional and stylistic power that we didn't see coming."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,88,Dennis's film attempts something few documentaries have: to inhabit the psyche of its subject.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,88,"A superb, violent, jarring and daring documentary."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,"This structure persuasively depicts combat and recovery as two sides of the same struggle, and Dennis strengthens his argument by maintaining a constant perspective throughout: the camera is always within a few feet of the subject."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,A tough but deeply rewarding watch. Search it out.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,"As vital as the best war chronicles to come out in recent years, this is one every American ought to see."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,Watching the formerly spry Harris struggle to maintain a normal life (he's frequently glassy-eyed and jacked on painkillers) emphasizes the underappreciated sacrifices our men and women in uniform make in the name of vaguely defined ideals.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,You can feel just how jarring and stressful it must be for a soldier to go from the life-and-death adrenaline rush of war to the maddeningly slow world of rehabilitation and forced inactivity.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,80,"Working alone with a camera and his ingenuity, Dennis captured the surreality of firefights with an invisible enemy and the frustration of displaced civilians."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,Dennis refuses to push a political agenda down viewers' throats. But the message of his film -- a breathlessly paced look at the realities of war -- is clear: War and its aftermath are indeed hell.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,The documentary Hell and Back Again may be the closest most civilians ever get to the reality of the war in Afghanistan.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,"The film portrays the dizzying divide between war and recovery eloquently enough that those choices seem like intrusions instead of connections, a misstep in what's otherwise a devastating profile of a soldier."
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,75,The film suggests that it doesn't really matter whether Harris ever gets back in uniform. He's forever carrying around a piece of unexploded ordnance in his head.
Hell and Back Again,6.5,40634,63,"Unlike most war documentaries, which tend to only skim the surface of its gun-toting subjects' lives, photojournalist Danfung Dennis's Hell and Back Again isn't content to merely capture warriors in combat."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,88,"You need to see this one on the biggest screen possible, and let it wash over you as if you had stepped inside the most incredible video game experience ever created — one in which events in the manufactured universe can have lasting and serious real-world consequences."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,83,"It runs too long and drags a bunch in its final third, but make no mistake: This is Spielberg’s biggest crowdpleaser in years, a CGI ride that wields the technology with an eye for payoff."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,81,"The sheer dynamism and energy of the movie are compelling, even when the character drama isn’t."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"Its plot is complexity itself, but its ""kids save the world"" soul is simple and earnest as opposed to earth shattering. With apologies to Bill and Ted, it's an excellent adventure, and let's leave it at that."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,The movie is crammed with excitement and good humor.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"Spielberg has seemingly done the impossible: balancing sugar-rush nostalgia with an involving story to create a pure, uncynical, cinematic ride that recaptures the magic of his early films."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"A rollicking adventure through worlds both bleak and fantastic, Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One makes big changes to the specifics and structure of Ernest Cline's best-selling novel but keeps the spirit and level-up thrills intact."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,76,"I don’t know how he does it, or for that matter why, but Spielberg turns Ready Player One into something that’s both nostalgic and new, something impersonal yet uniquely his. It is not one of his better movies; it’s probably not even in the top half. It’s way too long and packed with too much extra junk. It is still, somehow, a gas."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Although Ready Player One is nowhere near as memorable as “Jaws” or “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” it demonstrates that the director is fully capable of adapting to the times. What the film lacks in substance, it makes up for in style."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"My main beef is with Spielberg’s choice to leave out his own work, both as producer and director: “I didn’t corner the ’80s market,” he told Entertainment Weekly. But yeah, he kind of did."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"A loving ode to a few decades that Spielberg made his own, Ready Player One’s an entertaining nostalgia trip that wears its influences proudly but throws them at such dizzying force that sometimes you feel like you’re buried under Chuck E. Cheese tokens."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Never mind the director’s still-prodigious work ethic, the big-screen adaptation of Ernest Cline’s giddily overstuffed, ’80s-saturated best-seller is, in a way, a movie that couldn’t be more bespoke to Spielberg. After all, so many of that decade’s most indelible touchstones poured directly from his brain. It’s the perfect marriage of fabulist and fable."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"It’s good to see Spielberg, at 71, still finding new forms of cinematic language with which to express his humanism. It also should be said that though Ready Player One wears a cheerful face, there are none of the usual heartwarming, classic Spielberg moments. That’s because, second to “Munich,” this is his most pessimistic film."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Spielberg has invested massive creative capital into Ready Player One and the resulting production has all the ingredients viewers expect from potential blockbusters. Whether it achieves the level experienced by Spielberg’s biggest successes remains to be seen, but it is without a question one of the year’s most energetic, visually rewarding, and ultimately exhausting motion pictures."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,Spielberg's visual inventiveness is unflagging.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, a rollicking virtual-world geekfest flooded by ’80s ephemera, doesn’t just want to wade back into the past. It wants to race into it at full throttle. For those who get their fix through pop nostalgia, “Ready Player One” is — for better or worse — an indulgent, dizzying overdose."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Spielberg’s control of pacing, rhythm, action dynamics and tonal juggling is so astute that the story of Wade never quite gets lost in all the fly-by jokes and references. Sheridan’s highly skillful, as is Cooke."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Ready Player One, based on the bestseller of the same name, is a pandering, crassly commercial victory of intellectual property law that’s also, in its best moments, a grand popcorn entertainment, made with skill and wit and even sincerity."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Dazzling in form and a chase film at its heart, Ready Player One is exhilarating, but it also can’t sit still. Fitting to the content perhaps, the movie still arguably suffers from troublesome A.D.D. with its hyper fast cutting and its tendency to wander narratively."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Everything in Ready Player One ties together into an action-packed, upbeat, hero’s journey that keeps the film moving along at a thrilling pace. While it’s not particularly emotional and I was disappointed by how many questions are left open by its shallow visits to the real world, it’s still a lot of fun."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"Ambitious, sweet-spirited."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"There’s not much wrong with the movie on its own terms. But there’s nothing great about it, either. It doesn’t have the breathless exuberance, the highs, of Spielberg’s best “escapist” work, maybe because everything is so filtered, so arm’s length."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"Visually, the movie is amazing — jaw-droppingly so. This is as technologically impressive as anything Spielberg has done, if not more so. The story, on the other hand, based on the bestselling novel by Ernest Cline, doesn’t just allow for narrative shortcuts; it practically demands them."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,It’s an accomplished and intermittently hypnotic movie. Yet you may feel like you’re occupied more than you are invested.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,67,"Spielberg wants us to drop the techno-gadgets and join hands, but it’s the VR world that really juices him. He’s the ultimate fanboy making a movie about the need to move beyond being a fan."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,67,"And yet, for all those weaknesses, this is a Steven Spielberg film, of the kind only Steven Spielberg can make. Big, raucous, heartfelt, referential, and unabashed in celebrating the culture he has always loved."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,65,"Rather than dig into the mind-boggling, byzantine inner workings of the OASIS, Spielberg spends time with the flashier stuff. He is, even in this later, moodier phase of his career, still an entertainer first and foremost."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"It overuses ’80s nostalgia as shorthand for genuine emotional involvement, and it presents us with a rapturous digital wonderworld only to sternly lecture us that reality is the better value."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One is competent, occasionally rousing entertainment that nonetheless left me a little bummed."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"Ready Player One is at once familiar in its fabric and forward thinking in its technology, with a combination of gritty live action and glossy CGI. It’s an ambitious mix that can be thrilling while it lasts, and yet it fails to linger for long afterward, leaving you wondering what its point is beyond validating the insularity of ravenous fandom."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"If Ready Player One is tedious at times, it’s also oodles of fun at others."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"I didn’t dislike “Player One,” even if I rolled my eyes at the low-hanging fruit one-liners and cloying characters, the on-the-nose soundtrack tunes (Van Halen?), the cringe-worthy avatars from your favorite horror movies, all introduced to the giggles and applause of an audience sure it’s in on the joke. Because the movie was concocted to elicit just that reaction."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"It's a boldly attempted strike against the monolithic corporatization of fan service, and arguably one of the few films that defines dystopia as nothing less than a marketplace of trademarked, cross-promotional intellectual property. In other words, our here and now."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"I saw the film in IMAX, and a week later I’m still waiting for the safe return of my optic nerves, but it was the meagre emotional charge that shocked me most. Toward the end, as in many Spielberg movies, there are tears, but, for once, they feel unearned."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future. But it seems to have no idea how dystopian it really is.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It misses the point to ask, as some have recently, whether he’s still able to have fun at the age and status he has attained. Sure he is. He must have had great fun making this immense Tinker Toy of a movie, but there’s a fundamental mismatch between artist and material."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It’s a film in which Spielberg’s traditional reverence for the wonder and idealism of youth has had to compromise with wised-up survivalist toughness of the new YA mode. But what extraordinary visuals this films conjures up, with images that appear and disappear like quicksilver memes."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Ready Player One is entertaining enough, and it’s certainly well-made, but what truly stands out is the filmmaker’s prevailing-present sense of bemused disgust at the way his offspring are spending their time. He can’t go home again, and he knows it."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Mr. Spielberg, a digital enthusiast and an old-school cineaste, goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Spielberg asks audiences to fondly remember their childhood, and to fall back in love with characters, songs and stories long forgotten. At the same time, there is a didactic notion that reality is always better than a synthetic replication. You can’t comfortably have both."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It’s a CGI-heavy fantasia that will pop your eyeballs, but giddy as it is, it never quite sells its characters or gets much purchase on your emotions."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Once the initial thrill wears off, it’s a hollow kind of fun, which is almost certainly the point."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,Ready Player One isn’t slick enough a commentary worth getting riled up about or distracting enough to hide glaring structural issues underneath a barrage of “HEY I KNOW THEM!” cameos like dangling keys in front of a dog.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,58,"It’s a theme park ride but not the rollercoaster Spielberg hopes. More like It’s a Small Virtual World, careening through gamer nirvana, jerking viewers to and fro among everything Gen X retro."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,58,"In spite of how visually dazzling and legitimately entertaining it is, Ready Player One is at its heart, a celebration of the gormless rube. It is a paean to the schmuck. To celebrate it uncritically is to become one."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"So much of Ready Player One is assembled from the detritus of our past that it is less a film and more an overstuffed cultural recycling bin. A shiny, expensive, well-cast and professionally assembled recycling bin, sure, but a trash heap all the same."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"The scenes of millions of things happening at once are skillfully made, to be sure, but they’re still visually busy to the point of numbness instead of energization. The action has verve but no soul."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"Ready Player One has no obligation to be a rigorous intellectual exercise, even if it amounts to a wasted opportunity to explore who else might steer tech, and society, toward greater equity. But it doesn’t have to be so facile, either. Maybe next time the screenwriters shouldn’t set the difficulty mode to “easy.”"
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,The emphasis here is on the splashy spectacle with those insider-knowledge elements jammed together in a frenetic hodgepodge.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"This film, mostly shot in the UK, is technically suberb. But splitting the pleasures of virtual and reality, Ready Player One never fully satisfies on either front."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"Because Spielberg seems as eager as Wade to get back to the digital fantasy world he’s created, a lot of the human element is elided or glossed over."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,45,"Overall, the movie left me feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,42,"The joy of Ready Player One does indeed come from its world-building and kaleidoscopic mashup of pop culture—what Spielberg would likely dub its “movie” elements.... At a certain point, though, Ready Player One wants to be appreciated as a film as well as a movie, no matter what Spielberg says. And that’s where it begins to falter."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,40,"Those who come away cheering for Ready Player One will likely have enjoyed the film’s many references, the story’s breakneck speed and playful visual design. Others may want to unplug from the paint-by-number characters and shallow plot."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,30,"With Steven Spielberg behind the camera, Ernest Cline’s book had potential to transcend its source material. It’s disheartening that the finished product is little more than the cinematic equivalent of a pop culture mashup tee, which takes cherished icons of film and coats them in garish CGI while clumsily smashing them against one another like a child playing with action figures."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,58,Undiscriminating comedy fans hungering for the High School High of superhero parodies need look no further.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,"Given the abysmal quality of recent spoof pics, it's saying something that Superhero Movie provides a fairly steady stream of midsized laughs -- and even the 40% or so of gags that just lie there aren't actively painful."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,How can you tell the target age for Superhero Movie is exactly 13 1/2 years? Because most of the jokes are Internet-related.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,"The very act of writing critically about Superhero Movie inspires something of an existential crisis -- no one likely to turn out for it is reading this review, and anybody reading this review is probably not inclined to see it under any circumstances."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,50,"Puerile and idiotic it may be, but Superhero Movie is nonetheless smarter than most of its lowbrow brethren in the Hollywood sub-sub-category known as the spoof movie."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,42,"Seems to have been given the comedy equivalent of blood thinner. It has the blazing satirical boldness to skewer the first Tobey Maguire Spider-Man -- and, amazingly, not much else."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,By-the-numbers screen parody fails to resurrect an increasingly tired genre.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,"The gags are consistently weak, though actor Miles Fisher turns in a hair-raising impression of Tom Cruise."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,"What's shocking about Superhero Movie is not that it's been advertised to death on Nickelodeon to impressionable children, but that it's a completely on-the-nose satire of ""Spider-Man.”"
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,40,This super-powered spoof just doesn't fly.
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,30,"Predictable, flat, full of name-dropping, tragically unhip, and likely to make a decent amount of cash."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,30,"No real mockery is intended by this harmless, mindless grab bag of slightly used gags, which lampoons some of the conventions of recent comic-book epics and adds the expected staples of juvenile humor: urine, vomit and intestinal gas."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,20,"It's a tonally confused comedy which, for once, doesn't go far enough comedically."
Superhero Movie,4.5,26638520,0,"This abysmal ""Spider-Man"" satire has more in common with the lamentable spate of ""Epic"" and ""Date Movies"" than Zucker and Nielsen's truly funny ""Naked Gun"" series."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,80,"The movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight -- including the shallow philosophizing and computer-generated fakery that have overrun the summer blockbuster."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,75,"Nothing in director Paul W.S. Anderson's schlock drawer--prepares you for the peppy, good-time nastiness that is Death Race."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,75,It honestly delivers the goods without all the preachy moralizing about violent entertainment and cultural ruin.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,75,"Statham is an essential tough guy, what the Brits call ""well'ard,"" as self-assured as Lee Marvin."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,70,"Statham moves with such easy grace that you don't have to work hard to believe him. And if he can stand up to Joan Allen, melting her predatory stare with his own molten gaze, then it's clear he's not just the prettiest guy on the prison block, but also the toughest."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,70,"Though the picture doesn't deserve to appear on any critic's 10-best list, it observes the minimum standards of modern action films, which is to say it looks smarter, talks sassier and moves faster than almost anything else on the market."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,67,"This new version has absolutely none of the distinctive tongue-in-cheek black humor that was the keynote of its model and the trademark of its original director, Paul Bartel."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,67,"Soft sexual and racial jabs replace the more daring political commentary of the original, a crude classic from the Roger Corman factory."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,63,"This movie is about mayhem on wheels, tough guys viewers can root for, and villains whose comeuppances audiences crave. That's what Death Race is all about and, for what it is, it does a solid job."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,63,Death Race is our unshaven Brit hero's inevitable comeuppance: The Prison Job.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,63,"Smartly, Anderson makes some eclectic casting choices that keep the story from feeling as though it's populated by video-game characters."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,60,"It's nothing more than an enjoyable, ridiculously macho B-movie romp, but it's derson' best movie since the underrated Event Horizon. Perhaps, at long last, he' starting to find his - yep - top gear."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,58,"It's the perfect end-of-summer film, and a sign that summer needs to end soon."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,40,"The best you can say about the movie is that it isn't boring. It's fast-paced, but it isn't really well made."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,38,"OK, so no plot, really."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"It isn't so much a movie as a superheated, highly conductive miracle substance for the pure transmission of masculine aggression and misogyny."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"As hard as metal and just as dumb, Paul W.S. Anderson's Death Race couldn't be further from producer Roger Corman and director Paul Bartel's goofy, bloody 1975 original, ""Death Race 2000."""
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"Paul Bartel's ""Death Race 2000"" is a beloved camp item, but this slick, loud, violent remake is pitched at the video game crowd."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,30,"Well, you've got to say this for Death Race:  It knows what it is and doesn't apologize for it. What it is, incidentally, is junk."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,25,An ill-advised and severely wussified remake.
Death Race,6.4,36316032,20,"With its inexplicably watchable shotgun-riding bimbos, unconscious homoeroticism and ""Shawshank Redemption"" ending, The Fast and the Frivolous here is almost so bad it's good. Almost..."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,12,"It is an assault on all the senses, including common. Walking out, I had the impression I had just seen the video game and was still waiting for the movie."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,0,"Anderson has neutered the original film's outrageously transgressive macadam mayhem and completely stripped the story of its pointedly political social satire, making this Death Race one of the most boring drags of all time."
Death Race,6.4,36316032,0,Here's hoping Allen's static Hennessey is due to an extreme acting choice and not plastic surgery. It would be tragic to lose a natural smile to star in garbage like Death Race.
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,75,"Ip Man 3 also sneaks in welcome moments of mushy romantic sweetness between Master Ip and his wife, Cheung Wing-sing (Lynn Hung)."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,75,"As it happens, the weakest part of Ip Man 3 is its run-of-the-mill, almost juvenile potboiler plot."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,70,"Ip Man 3, set in Hong Kong circa 1959, combines the customary, inventively choreographed action with an unexpected emotional depth, proving as hard to resist as its entertaining predecessors."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,70,"Stone-faced martial-arts star Donnie Yen does a lot with a little in wuxia weepy Ip Man 3, the rare kung fu film whose sentimental dialogue scenes are just as good as its stripped-down action sequences."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,63,"[Ip Man] is the calm at the center of a storm of kung-fu combat sequences, and Yen plays him with grace and serenity."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,63,"Ip Man 3 credibly conjures the period with soundstage sets, rock-and-roll oldies and slicked-back hair. But director Winston Yip shows less concern for authenticity in Ip’s antagonists."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,60,"Unassuming, likable entertainment."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,60,"This time, celebrated action director Yuen Wo-ping, taking over from Sammo Hung, ensures the film’s fight sequences remain the film’s primary focus, although the overall tone is smaller and quieter, reflecting both the personal drama Ip Man encounters and Donnie Yen’s own encroaching retirement from kung-fu cinema."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"Less offensively nationalistic than the second installment but falling short of the glowing humanity, genial Cantonese humor and visual flair of the first, the pic is somewhat tarnished by its pedestrian plot and limp characterization."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"For all its grand promises, Ip Man 3 teeters uneasily among B-movie clichés."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"Despite Mr. Yen’s impressive physical virtuosity, his stoic, often humorless presence tends to neutralize the emotional temperature."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"Returning director Wilson Yip commits to this tone too late, getting lost in tangential conflict and stunt casting — in this corner, Mike Tyson! — at the expense of the drama and even the action."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,"In the end, Ip Man 3 doesn’t quite rise to the dizzying heights of the first two films, but then again, this will almost certainly be your only chance to see Mike Tyson go up against Donnie Yen."
Yip Man 3,7.1,2679437,50,Donnie Yen's performance is so good that it's a shame Wilson Yip's films have never strived to be more than briskly entertaining hagiography.
Runaway,5.9,6770587,70,"Runaway doesn't stint on the gizmos, and its inventiveness in that respect is its best feature; it comes up with, among other things, foot-long metallic spiders with a deadly sting and heat-seeking bullets that can be programmed to track specific human targets."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,70,"This near-future tale, in which Selleck heads a police division tracking murderous machines, is technically quite as accomplished as Crichton's previous work, carrying a strong atmosphere of menace and some virtuoso effects (including a tracking shot behind a bullet that makes the Bond movies seem old-fashioned). But once it turns from the hardware and the action to people, you can hardly believe your eyes or your ears."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,63,"The problem with RUNAWAY is that it never reaches deeper than a playful level, amounting to nothing more than great but shallow entertainment. Selleck provides a thoughtful performance, coming across as a real, feeling person instead of the expected Rambo-esque tough-guy stereotype."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,50,"This Michael Crichton robotic nightmare is so trite that the story seems lifted from Marvel Comics, with heat-seeking bullets and a villain so bad he would be fun if the film wasn’t telling us to take this near-futuristic adventure with a straight face."
Runaway,5.9,6770587,50,"Starts with savvy concepts (televised mind control and man’s reliance on robots, respectively) and quickly devolves into sour, overwritten diatribes."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Mighty Joe Young is not meek and harmless; it's a full-blooded action picture, all right, but with a certain warmth and humor instead of a scorched-earth approach. You feel good at the end, instead of merely relieved."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Joe is a masterpiece of special effects wizardry, looking more real than any giant primate ever to walk across the silver screen. By combining animatronics, computer-generated images, and a man in a costume, Mighty Joe Young creates a compelling illusion."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,Mighty Joe Young is a mighty fun movie. The trick? They didn't try to out-monster those bloated King Kong and Godzilla franchises. But it's still a hoot of an adventure about an overgrown ape having trouble adjusting to life in California.
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Mighty Joe Young is wholesome, well-crafted family fare like Hollywood used to make."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,75,"Mighty Joe Young may be the season's most appealing family bet. Certainly, it has an appealing cast."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,70,"It's all a little silly, and silly in a way that's less fun than the original—due in part to an obvious subplot involving a poacher played by a hammy Peter Firth—but its kid-friendly B-movie charm and the peerless Mr. Young make it worthwhile, undemanding entertainment."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,70,"Neat as Joe looks, you do wish that someone had bothered to give him a personality."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,67,"Mighty Joe Young, directed by Ron Underwood from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, is saddled with dialogue so wooden that Mr. Paxton and Ms. Theron almost seem animatronic themselves. Little children won't notice. In Joe, they can identify with the biggest, cuddliest simian toy a 6-year-old could ever hope to own."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,60,"Mighty Joe Young is a mighty big movie about a mighty big gorilla. And a lot of it is mighty bad -- unless you're a devotee of high tech and low camp, elephantine effects and mouse-sized stories, politically correct nostalgia and/or Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton in jungle outfits."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"Joe himself is an amazing creation, less personable, to be sure, than the original lovelorn King Kong, but a far more fully realized character than any of the flesh and blood humans by whom he's surrounded."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"Paxton, as always, is thoroughly engaging, and Theron is coming into her own as an actress, but the bottom line here is that the film lacks the original's goofy good humor. Less effects and more humanity are in order before this remake can even get within spitting distance of the original."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"This rather basic story is really just a place to hang the action scenes, which should have been the movie's glory. But those scenes turn out to be the worst things about Mighty Joe Young, in which the action is edited, MTV-style, for maximum incoherence."
Mighty Joe Young,5.6,50632037,50,"Those under 10 may love Joe, but adults will find him less appealing. Theron almost saves the day, until she flounders under the weight of poor dialogue, dull direction and a role that seems to value her make-up over her acting."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,88,"The most audacious, implausible, cheerfully offensive, hyperactive action picture I've seen since, oh, ""Sin City,"" which in comparison was a chamber drama."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,88,"This is likely the fastest-moving intentionally funny action movie ever made. It's as if the 21 Bond movies and four ""Die Hards"" had been distilled to remove their body fat (that is, character development, buildup, rest stops, etc.) and left us with only the killing and the punch lines."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,83,"Its pulpy violent excess will tip over...into slightly more excessive excess. That's its silly, scuzzball joy."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,80,"Anyone looking for subtlety, character development or layered plotting will be disappointed, but action fans will find plenty to amuse them with this film that makes ""Hard-Boiled"" look restrained."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,80,Extremely violent guilty pleasure of a thriller.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"This wet dream for action junkies leaves out logic and motivation --you know, all the boring stuff."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"The season's first guilty pleasure, Shoot 'Em Up is a joyously silly, R-rated, John Woo-in flected Looney Tune, with Clive Owen as a carrot-chomping, gun-toting Bugs Bunny matching wits with Elmer Fudd-ish assassin Paul Giamatti."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"It's funny without being toothless, adrenaline turbocharged without being mean and utterly deranged in the best sense of the word."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,75,"For sheer audacity and adrenaline-fueled carnage, Shoot 'Em Up hits its target pretty much dead on."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,70,The presence of the two actors and the film's mordant sense of humor buoy the downtime between bloodbaths and genre fans may find enough to love here.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,67,"It's all meant as gory good fun, but once the novelty wears off half an hour in, the rest of the film is only meant for people who absolutely agree with Giamatti's character about that violence thing."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,63,"There's a little bit of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in Shoot 'Em Up, although this production isn't as smart or as slick."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,63,"Absolutely not for feminists, lovers of period films, and anyone whose sensibilities are bruised by over-the-top stuntwork, it's a cocktail made up of three parts testosterone to one part brains."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,60,Intermittently amusing.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,58,"The saving grace in an exuberantly graceless movie is Clive Owen. This actor is bulletproof. Even in a sick-joke jamboree like Shoot 'Em Up, he mows down the competition and gets his laughs without losing his composure."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,The whole thing feels like watching somebody else play a video game. Director Michael Davis obviously was more interested in crafting a series of gunfights than a coherent story arc.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,Violent thrills and massive blood spills are the essence of the absurdly over-the-top action flick that is Shoot 'Em Up.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,One can certainly be amused and entertained by writer-director Michael Davis's hyperbolic action frolics--I was--but not without feeling pretty low and stupid.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,"A furious 90-minute trailer of a movie that exceeds the speed limit for action films established by Quentin Tarantino's recent ""Grindhouse."""
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,"As a bonus, it contains, at least, the best death-by-carrot scene in the history of film."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,50,"Despite all the flying bullets, which are admittedly entertaining at times, Shoot 'Em Up doesn't offer enough bang for your bucks."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,40,"Good taste is the first fatality in this gonzo thrill-seeker, sure to offend mainstream dispositions, yet too stylistically audacious to dismiss outright."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,30,"For the most part, this is strictly kiss kiss, bang bang, yawn yawn."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,25,"It sets a tone, all right. A lot of gamers (sorry, ""filmgoers"") may well enjoy writer-director Michael Davis' ultraviolent lark. It's not meant to be taken seriously. But films like this are worth taking seriously because they're genuinely cruddy and hollow and, yes, vile."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,25,Shoot 'Em Up is not only the title of Hollywood's latest descent into nonsensical mayhem but pretty much sums up the entire inane plot as well.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,20,"It's just gunfights strung together, without a whisper of coherence or meaning. The fights are staged so that they all look the same, and the principle is always the same: The gunman's multiple antagonists never hit, and he never misses. John Woo at least had fun with this sort of thing 20 years ago. And Giamatti? What the heck is he doing here?"
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,20,"The picture is just a catalog of strained camera moves and preprogrammed gags, with no wit or style."
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,0,A worthless piece of garbage.
Shoot 'Em Up,6.7,12807139,0,"Owen, Giamatti, and Bellucci--all fine actors at the peak of hireability--must have been coming off a collective coke bender when they agreed to be in this murky, straight-to-video-looking piece of crud."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,75,"But it entertained me more than Seagal's first three movies. There's more verbal energy and atmosphere, more humor: in-your-face, scabrous, wise-guy macho humor."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,70,"Director John Flynn does a fair job of keeping the minimal storyline crawling along well enough to justify all the mayhem. Too bad the climactic confrontation doesn’t justify the build-up. Stuntwork, however, is first rate, and Seagal remains a convincing action figure."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,60,"OUT FOR JUSTICE's only real weakness is Seagal himself. Always an icon rather than an actor, Seagal's face appears puffy and he's developing jowls. This doesn't bode well for his future as an action hero, since looks count; ugly guys are relegated to the heavy roles, and it's hard to imagine Seagal settling for such an ignoble fate."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,50,"Though it boasts a big budget and is indeed busier and more densely populated than Seagal's previous efforts, Out for Justice feels cheap, not only in its production but in its content. It's ""Scarface"" without a point of view; it's shallow plot cluttered with extreme violence, both verbal and physical."
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,50,I didn't care much for this movie. It's brutal and it's brutalizing. It seeks to make the audience an accomplice rather than a rational observer.
Out for Justice,6.1,39673161,40,"What’s numbing about this sub-Eastwood potboiler isn’t just the grisliness of the violence but the absence of any possibility that Seagal will stumble, or show doubt or pain, or have to challenge himself in order to defeat his enemies."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,70,"An effective weekend-from-hell thriller with a vital message, a terrific lead performance by Paula Patton and some unexpectedly dimensional storytelling from writer-director Deon Taylor (""Meet the Blacks"")."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,55,"It’s kind of hard to know where to begin with what’s wrong in Traffik, a movie where every scene takes about twice as long as it feels like it should, and the characters far too often make an escalating series of implausible and/or stupid decisions."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,42,"Trying to figure it out makes Traffik weirdly compelling, but nowhere near good."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,40,"There doesn’t seem to be any insidious motivation behind writer/director Deon Taylor’s vision for his film, no purposeful undermining of the real impact of sex slavery by coating it in a veneer similar to what can modestly be described as a highly eroticized, run-off-the-mill basic cable home invasion thriller. It’s misguided, not nefarious."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,40,"An attractive cast led by a vibrant, all-in Paula Patton and spiffy visuals courtesy of renowned cinematographer Dante Spinotti make the sleaze and predictable plotting go down a bit easier than they would have otherwise, but there's still no disguising the project's fundamentally lurid underpinnings."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,40,"Noble intentions are derailed by deeply confused execution in writer-director Deon Taylor’s Traffik, which attempts to marry cheap genre thrills with an unflinching depiction of the horrors of international sex trafficking, only to cheapen the latter and cast a grimy pall over the former."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,38,"Traffik isn’t a very good thriller, and if you aren’t two or three steps ahead of it, much of the time, you need more practice."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,38,"Deon Taylor seems uncomfortable with the escalating relentlessness of a siege film, eventually splitting Traffik off into a variety of other tangents and genres, diluting the potent subtext at the film's center."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,30,"Noble intentions, ignoble results."
Traffik,6.0,9186156,12,Traffik begins with that classic cinematic lie “inspired by true events” and ends with statistics for women who have been victims of human trafficking. Between these two bookends is a steaming pile of exploitative horse manure masquerading as a feature concerned with the sexual enslavement of women.
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,40,"The fact that Cannonball Run II isn't much good may not prevent it from becoming this summer's best- loved lowest-common-denominator comedy, if only because of the utter absence of any competition."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,40,"There are nun jokes, mafia jokes, big breast jokes, karate jokes, Jaws jokes, more big breasts. It's a long ride."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,20,"Execution is uninspired, laughs are hard to find, and the script is also difficult to locate. Reynold’s high-pitched laugh is wearing thin."
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,12,Cannonball Run II is one of the laziest insults to the intelligence of moviegoers that I can remember. Sheer arrogance made this picture.
Cannonball Run II,4.9,28078073,10,"Burt Reynolds and a host of notable performers seem to be having a hell of a good time wandering through this meandering, episodic farce, but rarely is their good mood shared by the viewer."
Blood: The Last Vampire,5.3,257412,75,"This isn't a great movie. But it's sincere as an entertainment, it looks good, it's atmospheric, and I will perk up the next time I hear Gianna is in a picture."

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,80,"Directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the new film brings all the cartoonish insanity of the pair's Crank saga to the -- let's face it -- cartoonishly insane concept of the Ghost Rider, a burning skeleton in leather who rides an equally fiery motorcycle. It's a match made in, er, hell."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,63,"A goofy, gonzo thrill ride, “Vengeance” is a bad movie sequel so bad it’s good, a bad movie that’s almost a great bad movie."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,60,"This doesn't lack for crazy charm, particularly when Nicolas Cage (in his go-for-broke Bad Lieutenant mode) and Ciaran Hinds (playing the devil) try to out-weird each other with broad, even cartoonish performances."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,60,"The film, though, has some redeeming qualities, including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy, who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance offers Cage plenty of opportunities to tap his inner circus geek, to twitch, cackle and flail without shame, going full tilt batwing crazy. Not since he danced in a pagan bear suit in The Wicker Man has Cage appeared this unconcerned about what the audience will think."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"The smugness of the film grows wearying long before the end. Just because the people on and behind the camera are willing to acknowledge what we're watching is ridiculous crap doesn't really change the fact that, well, it is."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"Spirit of Vengeance is so focused and, as a result, so impoverished that you actually feel bad for Cage. The actor tries to bring the weird (though at this point one wonders if he can even do anything else) but the film more often than not leaves him high and dry, saddling him with standard-issue action hero lines and boilerplate action set-pieces."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"Cage-ophiles will find some delectable freakouts in Blaze's transformation - or near transformation - scenes. Otherwise, the committee-penned script combines yokel-friendly haw-haw irreverence (non-sequitur cutaways to the Rider pissing in a flamethrower pattern) and sweaty monologues about ""controlling the Rider"" (the character is basically a mean drunk's superhero)."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,50,"So it's a half-certainty, half-shock that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is both good and bad, a sequel that's hungry for thrills but bereft of the cohesiveness - and budget - to be a full meal."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"The picture is still much too rickety, slapdash and surprisingly dull to qualify as a good barrel-bottom pleasure."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"With his (Cage) over-the-top delivery and operatically intense facial expressions, there's no way anyone could accuse him of phoning this one in."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"Alas, unlike the duo's Crank films - also about a hero on the verge of explosion - Spirit of Vengeance lacks a solid gimmick to unify their transgressive gambits."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"The first ""Ghost Rider"" film, directed by Mark Steven Johnson, was sort of a fizzy goof, the kind of movie where you don't expect much and then think, ""Hey, that was actually kind of fun."" Spirit of Vengeance, though, is undone by increased expectations, as promising more only makes it feel they are somehow delivering less."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"A water-treading sequel offering just enough kooky color to keep less-discerning funnybook fans occupied, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,40,"Like ""Ghost Rider: Low Voltage,"" this is a surprisingly underpowered excursion into Marvel's mad world by Neveldine and Taylor. More purgatory than hellfire."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,33,"The charismatic Idris Elba debuts in a key role as an alcoholic priest who recruits Cage's unique services. Yet instead of elevating the franchise, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance ends up squandering even more potential."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,33,"Most of the movie's action-horror set pieces play like lame Gwar music video outtakes, and Cage's signature mix of irony and off-the-rails mugging only works when you can see the actor's face. In Ghost Rider form, his character is just a skeletal automaton with neither a tongue nor a cheek to put it in."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,30,"This time out, the action is in 3-D, which amounts to a few shots of flaming motorcycle parts comin' at ya, but little else."
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,4.3,51774002,25,"For acting to be this bad in movie not directed by Michael Bay or George Lucas, it has to be intentional."

Maximum Overdrive,5.4,7433663,50,"Maximum Overdrive offers a variation on what has become a hopelessly hackneyed theme -- technology as monster. As long as King is tinkering with his crazed machines, the film sustains a certain amount of ominous tension, but as soon as the author turns his attention to his actors, the movie's slender storyline goes limp. It's dreary to the max."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,60,"As the tourist on a time budget, the usually brilliant Coogan merely mugs and flails (we can only imagine what Johnny Depp would have done with Fogg), while he and able straight man Chan enjoy scant opportunity to develop any comic rapport."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"Although each episode might be marginally entertaining in its own right, the overall effect is that the movie isn't funny enough, exciting enough, or dramatic enough to warrant two hours of an audience member's time."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"The major problem with Around the World is that there's just not quite enough Chan, or at least the Chan we want to see, which is the acrobatic clown."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,"A leaden excuse for family entertainment, loosely inspired by Jules Verne's 1873 novel, coarsened almost beyond recognition and dominated by Jackie Chan's comic martial-arts schtick."

Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,50,Any resemblance between Jules Verne's marvelous science fiction novel or Mike Todd's enjoyable 1956 movie is pure happenstance. This is simply a Jackie Chan movie pitched to youngsters who enjoy slapstick fights and goofy caricatures.
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,40,"It livens up a bit in the last reel when Foggs inventive brain pulls out all the stops to try to win the bet, but by that point you'll be too jaded to care."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,40,"With the exception of one masterfully choreographed - and improbably bloodless - martial-arts gang fight, the new version of Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days is one of the lamest remakes of a classic film I've ever seen."
Around the World in 80 Days,5.9,24008137,38,"A peppy, fast-moving, wafer-thin amusement that's fine for kids if you don't mind a lot of Three Stooges-style martial arts. For grown-ups, it's the equivalent of a 59-cent tin globe."

Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,87,"If the word “epic” has lost its meaning in the throes of recent summers, Man of Steel forcefully redefines it."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"Feels both modern and traditional – a halfway house between the broodier Nolan way of shaking things up and the louder, bone-crunching style that director Zack Snyder established with films such as ‘300’ and ‘Sucker Punch’. Man of Steel is punchy, engaging and fun, even if it slips into a final 45 minutes of explosions and fights during which reason starts to vanish and the science gets muddy."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"It aches for more depth and warmth and humour, but this is spectacular sci-fi — huge, operatic, melodramatic, impressive. It feels the right Superman origin story for our era, and teases what would be a welcome new superfranchise."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"A bracing attempt to bring the legend back into contention that successfully separates itself from other Super-movies but misses some of their warmth and charm. But given the craft and class, this could be the start of something special"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,The most striking and curious aspect of Man of Steel is the way it minimizes and even shuts out women.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"David Goyer, who wrote the script for Man of Steel from a story he concocted with Christopher Nolan, found a new way to make us care: The title character is disturbed by everything in his adopted home."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Man of Steel is, first and foremost, a great spectacle."

Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"The action is plentiful and thumping; Marvel-size thrills await you and the generations of kids who still believe in Superman. I just mean that the movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just O.K.; but the man part is super."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"If you like your summer-movie explosions huge, Man of Steel delivers. But it seems as if it might have delivered even more than a glorious noise."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"As much spectacle and action — minute-by-minute, frame-by-frame — as any movie anyone could think of. Zack Snyder’s huge, backstory-heavy extravaganza is a rehab job that perhaps didn’t cry out to be done but proves so overwhelmingly insistent in its size and strength that it’s hard not to give in."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"Snyder has cast Man of Steel with dramatic actors, not action stars, and it pays off."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,67,"Here are a few adjectives that do not apply to the new Superman movie: Beguiling. Frisky. Nuanced. Quiet. Even the title, Man of Steel, sounds too flighty for this film. Man of Lead, or Man of Plutonium, maybe."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"The story, while sometimes soaring, is other times grounded by a hyperactive and numbing vibe. But Henry Cavill has the strapping good looks of the comic icon, and humanity to match his superheroism."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"Snyder films the violence in Man of Steel the way he films most of the rest of the picture: Like a man chasing tornadoes and not even trying to keep subjects in frame. It's a choice, and not a bad one, necessarily — the Smallville farm scenes, in particular, respond well to the approach — but by the end it's a visually limiting one."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"Snyder knows how to put on a show, and Man of Steel has a massive scope that’s hard to resist... But what’s missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness, of pop joy."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"What it fails to supply much of — surprisingly, it must be said — is fun. This is serious business, Snyder seems always to be saying. This is badass. And given the sheer logistical size of the spectacle on display, it's a position that's hard to argue with."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"At once frantically overblown and beautifully filigreed, Man of Steel will turn on everyone it doesn’t turn off."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"The serious-minded result has many super-cool moments. But when it gets clunky, it’s super-meh."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"It has heft, it looks amazing, and it's businesslike to a fault."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"It’s a relief just to watch the actors act once in a while, and thankfully, Snyder is astute enough to punch some breathing holes in this steel-clad colossus."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"The whole film ends up feeling weighed down: though Man of Steel bounds from one epic setpiece to another, you're left with the nagging feeling that you just can't work out what the central twosome see in each other. And for Superman and Lois Lane, that's hardly ideal."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"Like Snyder’s Sucker Punch, it’s a confused but fascinating mishmash of religious, military, and sexual imagery."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,58,"While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen, the 143-minute Man of Steel is also the longest, and it only justifies that heft because it leaves room to keep the effects coming."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,58,"If this version of Superman is to have a future — as Warner Brothers seems convinced he will, having already green-lit the sequel — I hope Snyder will dial back both the casualty count and the Krypton mythmaking and instead focus on establishing a fictional Earth that’s rich enough to be worth saving."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Taking a cue from the “Batman” series, the film is dark and thudding and overlong."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"At least an hour of Man of Steel's excessive running time is devoted to the sort of crash-and-burn, slamming-into-skyscrapers CG fight scenes that we've already seen in ""The Avengers"" and ""Dark Knight,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""Spider-Man.""
Man of Steel is just the same old same old."

Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"The movie isn’t dead on arrival, like Snyder’s over-reverent ""Watchmen."" But it’s pleasure-free."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Man of Steel has too many characters and too much plot, resulting in a movie that feels overstuffed and overlong."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"If every generation gets the Superman it deserves, Man of Steel suggests we’ve earned one utterly without wit or charm."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"A mostly underwhelming film, with underdeveloped characters and supercharged fight scenes that drag on forever and offer nothing new in the way of special-effects creativity."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,The local multiplex is lousy with celluloid crime fighters. So what turf is left for good old Clark Kent? That's the nagging question that director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel tries — and ultimately fails — to answer.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Redundant, unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money, you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. “What are you smiling about, captain?” asks another cop. “Nothing, sir — I just think he’s hot.”"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,Here's one more studio extravaganza brought down by numbing action and an addiction to generic digital effects.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"So we get no zippy, Tony Stark-flavored one-liners. No comic-relief characters. No nonsense. But that means we also get no up, up and away, either."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"Despite looking, feeling and (especially) sounding expensive – this is one of the loudest summer spectacles of recent years – Man of Steel is second-tier and third-generation Chris Nolan-flavored neo-superhero material."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"The better actors — Kevin Costner, chiefly, as the adoptive Earth father — strain to supply warmth, but mostly, the minutes stretch into great expanses of blahness, much of them filled with Transformers-grade skyscraper snapping and bloodless catastrophe."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,The humorless tone and relentlessly noisy (visually and sonically) aesthetics leave much to be desired.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"A soulless, overblown bore."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,38,"All its faux-patriotism isn't played for satire, but instead utilized to align the film with an idyllic, unquestioned vision of goodness."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,38,"Snyder tries to up the spectacle ante with ever more explosions, crashes, thermal blasts, topological realignments, gunfire and mano-a-mano fistfights. But the result is a punishing sense of diminishing returns and a genre that has finally reached the point of mayhem-induced exhaustion."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,80,"Thunder is exactly what it promises to be: Not Much -- but at dizzying speed, stripped down and free of wind-resistant subtlety. There's a certain integrity to that. A certain deafening integrity."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,80,"If ""Top Gun"" was a stylish bimbo of a movie, all cleavage, white teeth and aerodynamic flash, then Days of Thunder is its paradoxical twin -- a bimbo with brains."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,75,And Cruise is so efficiently packaged in this product that he plays the same role as a saint in a Mexican village's holy day procession: It's not what he does that makes him so special; it's the way he manifests everybody's faith in him.
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,75,"Tony Scottmdoes his utmost to pump up the audience's adrenaline at all times, which means that the film's big moments - the races, the crashes, the news that someone needs brain surgery - don't seem that different from the small ones."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,70,"This expensive genre film about stock car racing has many of the elements that made the same team's Top Gun a blockbuster, but the producers recruited scripter Robert Towne to make more out of the story than junk food."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,70,"The film, though sleek and easy to sit through, replaces genuine dramatic involvement with a superficial, rock & roll empathy-it's as though we were watching Cruise's character and playing air guitar to his emotions. There are plenty of soulless movies around. What's special about Days of Thunder is that it works overtime trying to convince you it's not one of them."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,70,Screenwriter Robert Towne has certainly not challenged his gifts -- the script is loaded with stock cars and stock characters -- but he does deliver what's necessary: a workable setup for exciting NASCAR racing footage shot on sixteen Winston Cup tracks from Daytona to Watkins Glen.
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,70,"Days of Thunder delivers only the bare essentials. Boys, the reasoning seems to go, will be lured into the theater by the siren call of gasoline and super-charged engines, while their girl friends will tag along to get a look at Cruise in tight jeans."
Days of Thunder,6.0,82670733,67,"Every motion, from the clamour of the racetrack to the sparring of teacher and pupil, has been worked out for audience satisfaction and grants none. This is not a real film, it is an automaton, a pod-movie, and, thankfully, proved the death nail for such high-concept filmmaking."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,80,"As spectacular as you’d hope from a sequel to the 1996 planet-toaster, and as amusingly cheesy. You’ll enjoy yourself enough that you won’t even miss Will Smith."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,70,"Resurgence doles out the action and effects work in carefully calculated, incremental doses, which give the film a cumulative tension. Even if it’s hokey and jokey, this is a loud, effects-driven piece, with a driving score. For fans of Roland Emmerich disaster movies, this both hits all the marks, while delivering nothing new."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,Both impossible to take seriously or seriously dislike.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,"The main thing consumers will be looking for from Resurgence is bang-for-buck entertainment, and that it delivers reasonably successfully."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,This cinematic Big Mac entertains abundantly on its own second-hand merits.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,"It’s all too much too fast, and the cumulative effect is like watching a two-hour trailer – more dizzying than thrilling."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,58,Resurgence ends up falling victim to its attempts to differentiate itself while remaining completely derivative.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,58,"Despite all this, Independence Day: Resurgence still emerges as one of the better blockbusters of this summer, and that’s only halfway damning with faint praise. It’s a mess, but I grinned a good portion of the way through."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,55,"The spaceships and the destruction are bigger but not better in Roland Emmerich‘s twenty-years-later follow-up, where only Jeff Goldblum‘s sense of humor saves the day."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"No surprise, then, that Goldblum seems a little lonely and marooned in the latest venture, which suffers from a nagging case of Smithlessness."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,Tarnishes the image of its predecessor but the original Independence Day wasn’t all that good to begin with.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"The disaster sequences themselves — of which there are many, placed at regular intervals but disconnected from the story, like operatic arias — have a dreamlike and weirdly exhilarating quality that’s quite different from the plodding wham-bam destruction of the average action blockbuster."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"While the plot is dumb and the script is worse, watching aliens explode in spectacular fashion isn't the worst excuse to spend to two hours in air-conditioning."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,42,Fails both as a film and even as fan service.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,Lacks both the iconic heft of its predecessor's imagery as well as any sense of character development.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"Goldblum manages to rise above the proceedings via his invisible jetpack of dry wit — thank God for that. The only newcomer who emerges unscathed is Gainsbourg, who glides through this mess with Zen equanimity—even as chaos reigns, she keeps her cool."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,Laughably bad dialogue and wooden acting.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"This isn’t just lazy, it’s borderline nonsensical. Resurgence inflates the scale of the alien threat to such a preposterous degree – the mothership takes up roughly an eighth of the Earth’s total surface – that the queues of honking traffic and rooftop helicopter rescues we’re supposed to invest in can’t help but feel like microscopic trifles."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"This might have been titled ‘Independence Day: Submergence’. It’s certainly hard not to drown in the sea of CGI, with the exponential increase of pixels being to Independence Day what the Star Wars prequels were to the original trilogy."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"The movie must be bad, right? Worse, it’s a bore."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,This is a disaster by committee.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"It’s just dull and hollow — a massive waste of time and money. The characters are flimsy, the dialogue is stilted and the amount of destruction is ridiculous."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"Independence Day: Resurgence pretends there's fresh ground to cover. There isn't, but director Roland Emmerich makes a good show of faking it."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"Independence Day: Resurgence is all big effects, big explosions, epic battles rendered in state-of-the-art strokes. But really bad writing, achingly bad acting, groaning scenes and a serious lack of suspense and surprise all add up to zero fun, this time around."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,Ridiculousness needs to abound somewhat in a film like this — reality takes a seat early and often here — but Resurgence pushes everything to an egregiously over-the-top and often infuriating degree.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,33,"There’s no heart in this movie, no urgency."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"Honestly, I could watch Goldblum and Gainsbourg – two of the most quirkily sublime multihypenate artists alive – reading phonebooks to each other and enjoy the experience thoroughly, but sadly even they seem wasted here."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"The lackluster, at times abysmal writing wouldn’t much matter if Resurgence popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"While the first ""Independence Day"" was genuinely big, dumb fun, its sequel only manages to be a bigger, dumber bore."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"Independence Day: Resurgence is a bad movie, occasionally in ways that are good for a chuckle, like when people earnestly deliver lines like “Now listen up! They’re going for our molten core!” but mostly just bad in ways that make you wish you hadn’t wasted your money or your time."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,A curiously loud and ugly beast of a sequel.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"The sequel is even more silly, and much less fun."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"I saw Resurgence an hour and a half ago, and I feel like an alien wiped my memory clean already."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"The first “Independence Day’’ was a lot of fun, with a great lines and cutting-edge special effects. It was much imitated, so the sequel plays like a faded, eighth-generation copy with a cast that’s shooting blanks when it comes to humor."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,20,This hodgepodge has been thrown together in so slovenly a way that it’s no surprise the studio didn’t show it to the press.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,20,"Joyless and tedious, a reboot quite without the first film’s audacity and fun... It’s a movie that is going through the intergalactic motions."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,16,An immaculate case-study in how far blockbusters have fallen.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,"One of the most aggressively stupid blockbusters ever made, a painful exercise in Hollywood greed and artistic incompetence on every level."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,Disposable and shockingly inept.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,"Emmerich rewards our patience with an impersonally massive set piece involving the usual generic stew of mass CGI-imagined demolition. The insensitivity displayed toward human life in these sequences would be galling even by Emmerich's standards, if this pitiful albatross of corporate capitalism could work up enough energy to be offensive."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,100,"Our best fables and fairy tales are the ones that speak truth, and this version of Pete’s Dragon easily takes its place on any short list of the great films for young audiences as a result."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,90,"Experiencing Pete's Dragon is like seeing something thought to be extinct, a creation every bit as magical and mythical as the flying, fire-breathing beast its named after. That would be the straight ahead, unapologetic family film."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,90,"One of the year’s most delightful moviegoing surprises, a quality family film that rewards young people’s imaginations and reminds us of a time when the term “Disney movie” meant something: namely, wholesome entertainment that inspired confidence in parents and reinforced solid American values."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,88,Common wisdom says Hollywood doesn't make this kind of movie anymore. But it's not true.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,88,"A cinematic enchantment, a low-key 1970s-style kids’ movie brimming with sincerity and heart. It’s one of the best films of the year."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,88,"[Lowery] has made a larger, very different movie without losing his instincts, his directorial stealth or his ability to finesse his actors' performances, in this case in the vicinity of an achingly expressive and unexpectedly furry dragon with a little bit of bulldog in him."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,85,David Lowery‘s ease with actors and command of tone make Pete’s Dragon one of the best remakes in recent years.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"If your kids can get through the first five minutes of Pete’s Dragon (which rank right up there with the shooting of Bambi’s mother on the Disney trauma-o-meter), then you won’t find a sweeter family film for the waning days of summer."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,Looking for poetry in a live-action family film is usually about as futile as hunting for dragons in your backyard; the vast majority of them wager on the indiscriminate tastes of kids and their dutiful chaperons. But Pete’s Dragon has poetry in spades.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"The way Lowery observes Pete and Elliot’s relationship with nominal dialogue is beautiful. While it’s easy to deride the remake as commercially conceived, the film still feels as rare as the dragon it depicts, wholesome and heartfelt."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"It’s a lovely film that resonates all the more so in a summer of louder, more cluttered movies, and knowing that Disney had the confidence to allow Lowery’s vision to flourish is the icing on the cake."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"In capturing childlike wonder through Pete’s eyes, this film has more than a few heartbreaking moments regarding the definition of a home and the people (or fantastical creatures) that give it life. And by keeping things relatively small-scale, David Lowery’s studio debut retains a personal touch with an unceasing supply of magic running through its lovable, full-hearted soul."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,83,"There may be individual shots in this movie that cost more than the director’s entire pre-existing output, but make no mistake: This is a David Lowery movie — a movie imbued with the same tactile nature and uniquely American flair for myth-making that characterized his Sundance breakthrough, “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints.”"
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,80,"Lowery’s visual world essentially translates the movie’s message, that magic is everywhere if you allow yourself to see it. It may be a cliché and sappy sentiment, and one we’ve seen again and again in movies, but when done right it can be a beautiful one."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,80,"More than anything, this is a slice-of-life tale, whisper-thin but still full of feeling and a generous sense of place. With the world's most adorable dragon at the center of it all."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,78,Pete’s Dragon has the power to breathe fire into the most tepid of souls.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"For me, a grown-up spoiled by Pixar, Pete’s Dragon seemed sweet but slow and a little bland. My guests, entranced by the friendly dragon and the film’s 3D depictions of flight, thought otherwise."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"The movie is something of a shaggy dog hangout film, albeit one that literally features a shaggy dragon."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"A surprisingly effective work of family entertainment that hits all its marks, and then some."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"Thanks to Lowery's humanizing magic, Pete's Dragon is that rare family film you really can take to heart."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"Lowery’s update turns out to be one of the summer’s best surprises, a gorgeous, magical reworking that deftly strikes that once-elusive balance between contemporary and quaint."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"If the cast were less likeable, the predictability of the story might become wearisome. (Of course, it’s not likely to be predictable if you’re 9.) But all the actors, especially young Fegley and Laurence, engage us."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"There should be more American family movies like Pete’s Dragon. Since there aren’t, we should get behind this one."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,75,"All one needs to grasp is the hope and inherent magic of a kid and a dragon being BFFs, then let the feels flow from there."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"After half an hour or so of ... stutter steps, Pete's Dragon starts working on you, much like those gold standards of the boy-and-his-otherworldly-friend genre, ""E.T."" and ""The Iron Giant."""
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"Pete's Dragon is a gentle, understated family adventure, one that feels notably unlike the simplistically sentimental product the Disney imprimatur might lead you to expect."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"Mr. Lowery is very good with actors, and he lets much of his film unfold at a pace that may, in these frenzied times, seem rather leisurely. I thought the pace was fine, and admired him for giving his characters time to breathe. Elliott breathes fire, and the film around him breathes humanity."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,70,"Pete’s Dragon sports an undeniably old-fashioned, even slightly square demeanour, but even when that aura feels a tad forced, Lowery’s loving care gives the movie a likeable, small-scale charm."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,63,"It’s a lovely film, stately, sylvan and slow. It would take an insensate child and a very cynical adult to not fall for at least some of its charms."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"Lowery stumbles, working too hard to squeeze a response from us."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,Pete’s Dragon is a good movie. But it could have used a little more of the magic its characters are searching for.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"Where the original was a goofy, campy bit of stylized storytelling, Lowery's becomes a nicely realized, feel-good love song to fantasy and magic, buoyed by solid, updated visual effects, a strong cast (including two wonderful child actors) and a throwback sense of wide-eyed wonder."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"This being a kids film, there is a ‘message’ – about the destruction of nature. But the eco theme genuinely works with the film’s wonder at nature."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"What Pete's Dragon lacks in original plot, it makes up for in heart"
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,"Those with fond memories of a gentler era of boy-and-his-insert-critter-here heartwarmers are bound to welcome Dragon’s old-fashioned vibe. But it still feels almost perverse to place all of Weta’s hi-tech wizardry at the disposal of a film so stubbornly, studiously lo-fi."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,60,Strong performances and direction make the most of a lightweight tale.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,Fegley’s heartbreaking performance is fused onto a marshmallow. Lowery overcompensates for the darkness in the script by making everything else soft and squishy.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,The battle here is between the sincerity of the filmmakers’ intentions and the cynicism driving the film’s creation.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,"This sentimental, nearly genteel movie demonstrates there’s a world of difference between invoking magic and conjuring it."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,"Despite the vastly improved visuals, the new film is just as soft-hearted — and, unfortunately, just as mush-headed — as the earlier one."
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,50,It abandons its subtlety en route to becoming a moralistic screed about the preservation of the nuclear family.
Pete's Dragon,6.7,76233151,40,"Haphazard plotting and seriously undernourished character development aside, none of the emotional stakes have been planted deeply enough to elicit audience involvement in young Pete’s plight."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,80,"Everything about Executive Decision is familiar except how crisply its conventional story is executed. Since most action thrillers think blowing things up is enough to attract an audience, it's a nice surprise to come across a savvy piece of work that relies on suspense and is as professional as the elite anti-terrorist unit it celebrates."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,80,"Ultimately, it’s the film’s sly irony that sets it a notch above similar actioners. The Thomas brothers’ script repeatedly draws us down dead-end alleys only to reverse expectations and top white-knuckle situations with thrilling conclusions."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,75,"I think what I like most about Executive Decision is that director Baird constantly tries to top himself. A more experienced director would have ended the film a few crises earlier. But Baird goes for broke in his directing debut, and the result is a most entertaining movie."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,75,"It's the kind of thriller where it's fun to chortle over the plot--a movie for people who are sophisticated enough to know how shameless the film is, but fun-loving enough to enjoy its excesses and manic zeal."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,75,"Writers Jim and John Thomas and first-time director Stuart Baird have come up with a surprisingly deft variation on the airplane hijack genre, one that relies on subterfuge and suspense rather than explosives and body counts even though Steven Seagal is in it."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,70,"The escalating tension largely compensates for the lack of character involvement, and the climax will have you reaching for your safety belt."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,70,"A good, taut movie for red-meat action audiences, but it's not one you will be seeing on an airliner. Not ever."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,70,"If you're looking for satisfying junk food, Executive Decision is exactly the carryout you've been craving. This hijacking suspense drama steals shamelessly from Tom Clancy's kitchen, but it's tautly scripted, loaded with tension and interspersed with great comic relief."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,67,"Just when you're about to give up on this seemingly sorry excuse for an action movie, the picture does an about-face in a matter of minutes, and pushes the tension level way into overdrive and transforms suddenly into a solidly entertaining thriller."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,"The acting is all first base, the script a laughable stream of gung ho-isms, the action merely solid and the effects indifferent. Yet, you still stroll out with a grin a mile wide."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,Such a bluntly impersonal thriller that the title might almost be describing the production honcho who greenlighted yet another Die Hard clone.
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,"Competently directed by respected film editor Stuart Baird, it's a glossy production with plenty of Things That Go Boom, courtesy of producer/demolition expert Joel Silver."
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,This is a Seagal movie without Seagal and a Jack Ryan movie without Jack Ryan.
Executive Decision,6.4,56569216,63,"Unfortunately, Stuart Baird's direction is so sluggish and Jim and John Thomas' script so padded that Executive Decision has no build. Instead of focusing on the mechanics of suspense, the film concentrates to a boyish extent on mechanics, period."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,70,"Mr. Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming. And the film itself is a lively one for its genre, ambitious enough to do more than simply string fight scenes together."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,63,"Director Bruce Malmuth keeps the pace taut, the shots tight."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,63,"As it is, Hard to Kill has just enough going for it between the explosions and bone-crunching fight scenes to qualify as two hours of solid, high-decibel action entertainment."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,60,"It ain’t pretty, but it gets the action fans off."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,60,One for fans only.
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,50,"While Seagal is spraying bullets, breaking bones and throwing interchangeable bad guys through windows, this has a certain mindless appeal. But Malmuth's flaccid direction lacks the vicious muscularity and authentic edge of Seagal's previous feature."
Hard to Kill,5.8,47410000,40,"At this point, revenge thrillers have become so standardized that these films are really all the same film — a Mixmaster blend of Death Wish, Dirty Harry, Enter the Dragon, and Rambo. A star with a personality would only gum up the works."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,91,"Real Steel is directed by ""Night at the Museum's"" Shawn Levy, who makes good use of his specialized skill in blending people and computer-made imaginary things into one lively, emotionally satisfying story."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,80,"There's a little ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" here, a dash of ""Transformers"" there, and it's all topped with big heap of ""Rocky."" But it's hard to argue with the results, because, at times, Real Steal is close to a knockout."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"If you can get past the ridiculousness of the setup - easy to do, because the posters make it clear this isn't a Woody Allen movie - it's pretty much impossible not to have fun."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,The movie is corny enough to remind you that boxing rings are square.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"It is earsplitting, crowd-pleasing, and, no doubt, 'bot-pleasing, too. If you told me I would get emotionally and viscerally involved in two machines punching the hard drives out of each other, I would tell you you were crazy. I would be wrong."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"By the time the two hour running length has expired, it's safe to say that Real Steel comes across as a legitimate crowd-pleaser."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"Real Steel is a real movie. It has characters, it matters who they are, it makes sense of its action, it has a compelling plot. This is the sort of movie, I suspect, young viewers went to the ""Transformers"" movies looking for."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"Like ""Moneyball,"" this is real movie making that packs a solid entertainment punch."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,"It goes through all the motions, properly and efficiently, and yet it's missing some core warmth. Watching Real Steel, I kept thinking of Brad Bird's retro-modern cartoon ""The Iron Giant,"" and of how that picture humanized a metal alien so effortlessly."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,"Although the marketing looks like ""Transformers 4,"" Real Steel is the real deal, a Rocky with robots that ought to have audiences standing up and cheering."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,The uncanny thing about Real Steel is just how gripping the fight scenes are; Sugar Ray Leonard served as a consultant to the motion-capture performers responsible for pantomiming the machines' moves.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,67,"Real Steel falls somewhere near the intersection of elation and shame, essentially reworking the Sylvester Stallone arm-wrestling non-classic ""Over The Top"" for the equally ridiculous sport of android fisticuffs, and mostly getting away with it."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,63,"If familiarity is endemic to this feel-good drama, there's nonetheless also something to be said for competent amalgamation and regurgitation of tired genre tropes."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Rocky with robots? It's not quite in Balboa's weight class, but Real Steel at least has some heft. There's barely a story beat among the beat-downs that you won't expect, and sometimes the saccharine gets in the way of the spectacle, but on the whole this is enjoyable family entertainment."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"When I was 7 and saw ""Over The Top,"" I saw no irony in its moniker, even during a slow-motion close-up of two battling hands. While Real Steel is similarly ludicrous, I predict it will play like a masterpiece with 7-year-olds."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"As it happens, this recycled reclamation of underdogs saga is neither as bad as it sounds nor quite as good as it could be."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Based very loosely on a short story by ""I Am Legend"" author Richard Matheson, Real Steel in fact comes closer to road-bonding movies featuring children and hesitant papas: ""Paper Moon"" or ""Over the Top,"" say."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, the movie's special effects are seamless and far more cleanly cut than any of Michael Bay's hash. But the element that lingers longest is a subtle strand - also woven into last week's ""Take Shelter"" - of recessionary anxiety."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,58,"Real Steel is sci-fi without the science, and the fiction is strictly 20th century, straight out of Rocky knockoffs."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"The story remains sadly mired in botdom, which leads to some boredom. It's hard to look away from the ever-dazzling Jackman, but the sight of him hunched over the controls of something akin to a live action video game is not, in the end, much more exciting than the sight of your average teenager hunched over the controls of a Game Boy."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"When making a film for 10-year-old boys, it doesn't have to be good, necessarily -- just good enough. And that's exactly what Real Steel is: good enough."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"What it lacks is the human element. Charlie is more of a rat than a rascal, and instead of working hard to build and operate his robots, he's literally going through the motions."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"They should call this overloud, underwhelming movie ""Real Steal."""
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"It's a combination that seems ideal for 10-year-old boys who adore violence, and could well be the cornerstone of the next DreamWorks franchise."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"It's an odd blend - a sentimental story in a futuristic world of brutal machine-maneuvered fights. There are some ringside thrills, but it's not a seamless mesh."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"An underdog drama with clanging metal-on-metal action, Real Steel feels scientifically programmed to claw at your heart while its battling robots, which have a semblance of human personality, drum up your adrenaline. That said, I'm not sure that the movie itself has more than a semblance of a heart."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Sugar Ray Leonard helped with the motion-capture, and it shows. Good stuff. But the tear-jerking in Real Steel is as shameless as its product placement. We're being hustled."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"A slightly soggy tale of father-son bonding, crossed with an action-adventure flick about high-tech battle-bots."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,I suspect a lot of what I found synthetic and sort of galling in Real Steel will work just fine with the target audience.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Lost's Evangeline Lilly remains lost, however, in this film role as Charlies's too-good-to-be-true romantic interest."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Jackman gamely does his best,  Levy keeps the kid just shy of insufferable and just this side of kid-appropriate in his behavior and language."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,This punishingly predictable tale will test whether sci-fi action fanboys can stomach having their cherished genre infiltrated by sentimental hokum about a down-on-his-luck dad and his spunky long-lost son.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,40,"In either a stunningly brave or misguided act of meta-absurdity, Real Steel, which is about a boy, his dad and the robot that changes their lives, actually feels as if it were made inside the mind of a kid obsessed with robots."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,38,"Real Steel is to action what the Anthony Weiner habit was to sex: It's so virtual, so distant from the thrill, that you wonder what the point is. Do you really want to pay to watch an actor playing a kid who in turn plays what amounts to a video game?"
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,80,"Tombstone is incredibly entertaining. While not entirely original and not always well executed, it manages to keep your attention for the entire 130-minute duration. And let's face it, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is what really sets it apart."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,"Tombstone remains a shamelessly entertaining movie, filled with lively turns from virtually every appropriate actor not working on the Costner version."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,"Tombstone is a tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,A few stirring shoot-'em-ups help relieve the logjam of cliches. Director George P. (Rambo) Cosmatos does an OK job at the O.K. Corral. But even the good stuff goes on for too long.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,70,"Kilmer makes a surprisingly effective and effete Holliday, but Russell lacks the stature for Earp - Sam Elliott as his older brother Virgil suggests a better movie. There's a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls, but mostly this is rootin', tootin' entertainment with lots of authentic facial hair."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,63,"Highly stylized fashion-wise but awkwardly unfocused in its plotlines, it aims for the western iconography of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone but never gets past its own directorial hurdles."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,63,Tombstone is a movie that wants to have it both ways. It wants to be at once traditional and morally ambiguous. The two visions don't quite harmonize.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,60,"Though apparently conceived as a revisionist Western, Tombstone falls prey to the cliches of the genre, and its last third is a muddle."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,60,"This has plenty of designer gore to go with its periodic spurts of bloodletting, and a lot of care and attention were obviously devoted to selecting locations, designing sets, and grooming handlebar mustaches. Much less attention went to making one believe that any of the events took place circa 1879, but at least the bursts of action keep coming, and most survive Cosmatos's addiction to smoldering close-ups."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,"If only director George P. Cosmatos (Rambo) knew how to do something with cliches other than throw them into the pot and stir. A preposterously inflated 135 minutes long, Tombstone plays like a three-hour rough cut that’s been trimmed down to a slightly shorter rough cut."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,Doesn't really cut it in the Western genre.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,"As much as these actors heroically struggle to focus the film, the director more successfully hacks it apart. But if you really love Westerns, despite its faults, it's got to be recommended for Kilmer's performance alone."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,Crashing through are several raffish characters whose acting doesn't get in the way of the stunts.
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,"Flexploitation pure and simple -- nothing but savagery, sex and sinew."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,"First-class stunts, fine photography, and solid acting by Weathers and Vanity combine to lift this action film above its ludicrous story. Had the filmmakers not undermined the project with inane plot twists, unexplained motives, and absurd coincidences, this could have been a real winner."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,Weathers turns out to be a disappointingly weak lead whose low-key likability doesn't make up for his lack of anger and drive-crucial attributes for any action hero. And Baxley is surprisingly stingy with his action sequences.
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,50,"Sometime stunt co-ordinator Baxley directs this feebly-scripted, sporadically exciting crime pic like a showpiece for his former speciality."
Action Jackson,5.3,20257000,40,"Action Jackson is a movie where some of the parts are good, but none of them fit and a lot of them stink. The movie tries for so many different effects in the course of its endless 94 minutes that I walked out feeling dizzy."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,80,"A macho, adrenaline-fix suspenser that plays like the bigscreen equivalent of those pulpy spy novels that once clogged grocery-store checkouts."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,75,"This is actually a pretty good thriller, based more on character and plot than on action for its own sake. The need to construct killings that look like accidents adds to the interest."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,70,"This muscular thriller--led by Jason Statham, Clive Owen and Robert De Niro--strives to be a genuinely good film, but unwilling to let go of proven formulas, it falls short."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"Killer Elite is pleasurable enough, but with a steadier hand, it could've been one for the books."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"A snarly Euro-thriller with crust under its fingernails and bad breath. It doesn't care if you like it, which is why I kind of do."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"Despite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite, Gary McKendry's feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,63,"Best of all, the filmmakers took the time to give these hard men just the right things to say - not catchphrases, just lines that smell of blood and gunpowder every time Statham, Owen or DeNiro utter them."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,60,"It's a generically enjoyable action film with a bit of hardboiled based-on-a-true-story-ness about it, and since it's set in the '80s and feels like an '80s movie, it seems a lot like something you must have seen years ago."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,60,"If you're willing to accept Killer Elite as a shoot-'em-up action movie with good actors taking the spots of the usual lunk heads (but spouting the usual nonsense), you'll be pleased with the film."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,58,"De Niro, in what amounts to an extended cameo, is radically miscast. That's still no excuse for his nonperformance, which is beyond lackluster."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,55,"The picture, the debut feature of Irish director Gary McKendry, is rote and joyless, an exercise in disposability."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,Killer Elite's major problem: motion at the expense of emotion.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,"Loaded with careening car chases and rooftop runs, glass-shattering shootouts and exploding fireballs, Killer Elite offers more than enough to keep action junkies happy."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,Killer Elite is based on a true story and about a half-dozen Jason Statham movies.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,"The script is a mess. It's an object lesson in taking a nonfiction book (""The Feather Men,"" about a cadre of ex-British Special Air Service operatives) and making a hash of it."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,"Killer Elite is too formulaic to overcome a been-there, done-that feel."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,50,Killer Elite pretends to be fact-based and true to its 1980s period. Just know it's all baloney.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"There's nothing here for the viewer to do, no kinks to work out, no double-crossings to anticipate, not even a half-hearted flail at figuring out how Danny ticks."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"A few good stunts, some tolerable brooding and one nice, if silly desert chase. But not essential."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"When Robert De Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Statham unite for an action thriller, we should be able to expect something special. Or at least memorable. Instead, Killer Elite gives us ordinary."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"Killer Elite is distinguished by one no-mercy, eye-gouging, testicle-punching brawl, and one whoppingly indifferent screenplay."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,40,"A few awesome firefights does not an action film make, and even De Niro's Ronin-esque interlude can't shake the feeling that the thrill, like the '80s, is gone."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,38,I've got another portmanteau word for the movie: unbelievaballistic.
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,33,"This clumsy action movie feels too generic to be real. The film attempts to add an element of sophisticated sociopolitical commentary to the typical Jason Statham head-busting shoot-'em-up, but only ends up draining it of visceral thrills."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,30,"We all have to make jokes around the water cooler, and if enough people bother to see Killer Elite, its silly nonsense could make for a great comedy routine by Greg from IT."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,30,"Pure punishment, this rote action flick from Australia."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,25,"Director-co-writer Gary McKendry seems to know a thing or two about hard-fisted fight scenes, but he muddies up the visuals with obligatory spasms of shaky-cam."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,25,"Killing looks ridiculously easy in this dispensable exploitation picture, directed for maximum impact of head-cracking pain by ad-trained Irish director Gary McKendry in his first feature."
Killer Elite,6.5,25124986,20,"Whatever the case, Mr. Owen and Mr. Statham (who provides a nice duet with a chair) make a prettily matched pair amid the pileup of sub-Bourne action set pieces, sad laughs and clichés."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,80,"Deft, funny and intelligently scary."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,67,"Joel Schumacher directs with far less fetishism than he might have, while producer Jerry Bruckheimer kicks up only a fraction of the bull dust usually visible in his projects."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,63,"There is much more suspense in this sequence than a similar scene in last week's ""The Sum of All Fears"" -- which wasn't intended to be funny."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,"Hopkins and Rock are a surprisingly good mix; Hopkins actually underplays his role as a company man with a barely acknowledged conscience, while Rock's manic impulses aren't allowed to run riot."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,"Anthony Hopkins, with a toothpick and a slouch. Fabulous!"
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,It's almost impossible to enjoy this uneven but mostly exciting popcorn pic without flinching at a few plot elements that feel a bit too real for comfort.
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,60,"From the plotting and the characterizations to the explosions and excessive use of blue light filters, everything about Bad Company has been done and seen before."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Bad Company would just be another silly, intermittently funny, buddy comedy (Anthony Hopkins is Rock's training agent) were it not for a plot unlaughably close to current events."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"As in all Jerry Bruckheimer-produced summer blockbusters, the premise is paper-thin and the action sequences play out with assembly-line regularity."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Company almost seems like the product of a post-Sept. 11 world. Like a cartoon version of a real threat, the villains are terrorists of a non-specific nationality with an ill-defined anti-American agenda and a tendency to spout complaints too clichéd to take seriously."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"I won't tell you I didn't enjoy parts of Bad Company, because I did. But the enjoyment came at moments well-separated by autopilot action scenes and stunt sequences that outlived their interest."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Feels stale, bloated and willing to get by on sheer familiarity."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"It's fast, snappy and entertaining in a superficial way. But it lacks gravity and authenticity and seems more like a product than an attempt to tell a story."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"It's fun to watch for a while. But the movie runs much too long, and a few funny bits aside, most of the comedy writing is lame."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,50,"Though they're a good pair (Hopkins and Rock), this isn't a very good movie. It's slick but hollow."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,42,"Watching Rocks shows, we know he's sharper than the average actor. But watching him flail and play funny in movies that aren't as smart as him is simply depressing. Someone give this man a good role. And please, let him do a few more takes -- these scenes can't be his best efforts."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,40,"Whether you care if they find them (terrorists) or not may depend on how much you've been able to withstand Bad Company's sensory overload of firefights, vehicular mayhem, techno-cool swagger and enough bumptious contrivances to fill several seasons of daffy prime-time soaps."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,40,"Some of this stuff is uncomfortably close to minstrelsy. Bad Company closes on a patriotic note in a brief scene that pays heartfelt tribute to the terrorist-thwarting sacrifices of the CIA. Timing is everything, I guess."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,40,"The motor of the plot, involving nuclear terrorism, not only knocked Bad Company out of last year's release schedule due to 9/11 sensitivity, it stops Rock and Hopkins from sustaining a comic rapport. The waste is criminal."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,38,Schumacher doesn't leave an imprint on the film -- it could be the work of any second-rate director.
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,38,"Leaves a bad taste, not only because of its bad-luck timing, but also the staleness of its script."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,38,"A longwinded, predictable scenario."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,30,Lacks the bite that can equal the Bruckheimer bark.
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,30,"The picture lasts 111 minutes, partly because of numerous false endings. Now, that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher, and reflects the worst of their shallow styles: wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one (and no one)."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"A Jerry Bruckheimer production, which gives the movie a disquieting sense of stupidity."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"Like many of the nonpolitical terrorist-as-villain spectaculars that have been held back after Sept. 11, has the whiff of something gone stale. Though it may have sat on the shelf for a while, this project had gone bad long before it was released."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,25,"This cookie-cutter spy thriller depends on the chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. Um, wait, there isn't any."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,20,"Predictably soulless techno-tripe, this Bruckheimer-in-a-can thriller is leavened only by the ludicrous notion of Chris Rock playing separated twins."
Bad Company,5.6,30160161,20,The major problem with this alleged comic thriller is it is neither funny nor thrilling. Neither the heavies nor the good guys are believable.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,75,So chalk Escape Plan up as a pretty good action movie given an extra edge by the intelligent use of its two main actors.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,75,"Though this movie can’t match the formal qualities that made the pair’s most iconic films work, it goes a long way toward recapturing their sense of cheesy fun."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,70,"With its fun script and cheap visuals, Escape Plan evokes the halfwit cheesiness of 1980s-era Cannon films, but it also recalls the deft pacing and legibility of their action sequences."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,70,"Here are two action stars having fun; watching them work together as a team is a lot more entertaining than you might have expected. Try not to think too hard about it, and Escape Plan is stupid, stupid fun."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,68,A Stallone / Schwarzenegger film that isn't completely beneath them.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,67,"Escape Plan is so dumb it's adorable, as any movie pitting Sylvester Stallone's grunt against Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent should be."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,A display of old-school muscle-buddy connivance that’s as flatly preposterous as it is shamelessly entertaining.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,The heist-inspired elements aren't well thought through and it becomes a question of which is harder to swallow: the mechanics of the story or the idea that a couple of sixtysomethings can kick this much ass.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,Stupid but fun.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,Any prison-break yarn that includes Arnold Schwarzenegger delivering the line “You hit like a vegetarian” is OK by me.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"The script never gives them the kind of memorable exchange that makes fans howl with delight. But all in all, Escape Plan does what it sets out to do."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Escape Plan is mostly a gray, thudding metal machine of throwback exploitation, but the goateed, goofy Ah-nold is so happy to be in the thick of an old-school bruiser again that he makes it feel like the dumb-fun flashback party it is."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"No new ground is broken, and viewers will, not unpleasantly, get everything they expect. It’s apparently morning in America again."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"As the unpredictable, mischievous inmate with the unlikely name of Emil Rottmayer, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s sidekick role in Escape Plan may make audiences weep for the films we missed out on while he made speeches in Sacramento."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Stallone and Schwarzenegger have all the gravity here, and keep pulling Escape Plan in the direction of an old-fashioned tough-guy action film, one filled with nods to their onscreen pasts and offscreen exploits."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Mercifully free of tongue-in-cheek meta-humor, Escape Plan is a likably lunkheaded meat-and-potatoes brawler that never pretends to be more sophisticated than it is."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"A highly enjoyable slice of in-one-eye, out-the-other nonsense. It may coast on the charisma of its leads at times, and it’s hardly deep, but there’s a Friday night to be had."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Schwarzenegger, for one, seems to be having a hoot."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"The plot itself is predictably divorced from reality, containing more holes — and smelling staler — than month-old Swiss cheese.  All of which means that Stallone and Schwarzenegger end up having to do all the heavy lifting."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Sure, it’s fun to see the Governator and the Italian Stallion he-manning it up together feature-length for the first time — the screen is barely big enough to contain the two of them — but the prison-break movie Escape Plan is unworthy of the momentous occasion."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Action fans -- particularly devotees of brainless '80s shoot-em-ups -- may find enough to like here, particularly the preposterous mayhem of the third act."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"In one amusing bit of dialogue, Stallone and Schwarze-negger kid each other about being smarter than they look. For a little while at least, we thought we might be able to say the same about Escape Plan."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"The tempered violence, the nature of the villains, the easy bonhomie of our leads and a cast peppered with great supporting players make Escape Plan go down easier than the other “Rambo/Last Man Standing/Expendables” pictures that brought these two aged action stars back from the dead."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"It won't stick to your ribs in the way, say, a shank will -- but it probably won't leave you looking for a way to escape the theater, either."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,It’s not fair to either of these actors to want to see Rocky and the Terminator over and over again. But it is fair to want to see them in something better than this.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"With a tighter plot and slightly more knowing craftsmanship, this might have worked, but Swedish director Mikael Hafström (1408, The Rite) isn’t really the man to poke fun with any sophistication at his stars’ well-established personas."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"Escape Pla’ would have made a perfect vehicle for, say, a Chuck Norris or even a Jean-Claude Van Damme. But these two redoubtable, enormously watchable old-school heroes deserve better."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"For a long stretch of the second act the film feels like doing a long stretch, but Schwarzenegger’s having a ball as Stallone goes through the motions."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,38,"Yeah, it's a mishmash of good, strange ideas and generic nonsense, barely held together by Sly and Arnie."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,33,"Escape Plan deserves some credit for gradually rising from abysmal to almost-mediocre, though it’s needlessly complicated in every step of the way."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,30,"The film is eventful and full of suspense, but also obvious and completely contrived."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,30,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a good thing, too."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,25,"A dim anti-privatization parable that preaches a familiar strain of cynical, unchallenged self-righteousness in the face of widespread abuse of civil liberties."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,100,"Enter the Dragon goes far beyond the philosophical, of course. Its best sequences, and the only real reason for seeing it again, involve Lee's phenomenal physical and emotional presence."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,100,"Bruce Lee was the Fred Astaire of chop-socky, and Enter the Dragon represents his finest work."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,91,"Even though the movie was, in a lot of ways, a glorious mess, it turned out to be a huge success on just about every level."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,91,"A sequestered island, a slinky score, a villain with a secret scheme and a deadly prosthesis — it’d be good, cheesy fun even without the centerpiece fight sequences."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,90,"Bruce Lee's last movie is the only one that gives him the star treatment he deserved. His charismatic presence is remarkable in Enter the Dragon, and it's a shame he didn't have the chance to become the great, unique star he seemed destined to be."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,90,"Action superstar Bruce Lee's consensus best movie and biggest international hit. Lee is a secret agent inflitrating a sinister island kung fu kingdom, battling John Saxton, Jim Kelly and the nefarious martial arts lord Shih Fien in famous set-pieces like the hall of mirror showdown."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,88,"It's not a great film, but Lee's superhuman skills make it an occasionally jaw-dropping experience."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,"The movie can be flat-out fun, a sort of carnival of combat that can turn even a sophisticated audience into a group of gawking kids at a Saturday matinee."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,Film carries all the explosive trappings that make for a hit in its intended market and is glossed with a melodramatic narrative to take full advantage of its theme.
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,"Ripping entertainment overall, with just enough meat for amateur sociologists."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,"The lack of sentimentality helps focus the viewer on what the film depicts exceptionally well, namely wanton bad behavior and enthralling, wall-to-wall ass-kicking."
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,80,The picture is expertly made and well‐meshed; it moves like lightning and brims with color.
Enter the Dragon,7.7,25000000,75,"Nobody shows much evidence of acting ability, and the script is full of holes. Nonstop action is what these films are about, and that's what you get here."

"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"Ambitious of vision and swooping of camera, I, Frankenstein is no ""I, Robot,"" let alone ""I, Claudius,"" but it’s definitely watchable on a cold Jan. evening or, a few months from now, on your I, Pad."
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,50,"With no clear idea how to end the movie, which has come to resemble an excessive episode of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, writer/director Stuart Beattie (G.I.

"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,40,"I, Frankenstein is nowhere near as garishly, ghoulishly awful as ""Van Helsing,"" Universal’s last attempt to resurrect its classic monsters. It’s a grimly fiendish slog nonetheless, and hardly worth getting up out of the grave for."

"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,30,"By far the scariest thing about director Stuart Beattie’s I, Frankenstein, a terrible would-be horror story that somehow roped in a couple of really good actors, is that the ending seems to suggest the possibility of a sequel. Now that’s horror."
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,30,"Eckhart plays Frankenstein’s monster in a monotonous, teeth-gritting mode, as if someone had one gun on him and another on his family."
"I, Frankenstein",5.1,19075290,30,"Director/screenwriter Stuart Beattie, adapting the graphic novel by Kevin Grevioux, employs a strictly humorless, gothic approach to the material that makes one long for the satirical touches of James Whale, let alone Mel Brooks."

Dodookdeul,6.8,685839,75,The Thieves is less interested in the characters than it is the elaborate stunts and gimmicks.
Dodookdeul,6.8,685839,70,"While the movie's second half feels more consequential - and more impressively action-packed - than its first part, it also loses some of its initial charm and quirk via a protracted, often dizzying descent into a kind of booty-centric game of hot potato."

Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,67,"With more sophisticated writing, one suspects they could really soar: Even here, slowed by clunky, character-establishing lines and an all-devouring plot, they hit more often than they miss."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"But the bad boys achieve something a budget can't buy: an easy, natural rapport that makes you root for them. For comedy and thrills, Lawrence and Smith are a dream team."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"We've seen it all a million times before, but there are abundant (foul-mouthed) funnies, and debut director Michael Bay shows his commercials expertise propelling the noisy nonsense into a frantically slick and thoroughly enjoyable extravaganza."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"Crucially, the teaming of standup favorite and ""Martin"" star Lawrence and ""Fresh Prince"" Smith clicks from the outset, with both right at home handling action and comedy on the bigscreen. Even when it's not particularly funny, their interplay is engaging, and their lively, raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,"Would have been better if it had been sleeker and shorter. After all, this film isn't aiming for high-toned drama, just high-energy entertainment, which is what it delivers."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,"The flabbergasting scenes here-written by a team of ""Tonight Show"" and ""David Letterman Show"" writers and directed by hot, young TV-commercial and music-video director Michael Bay-are slick, fast, loud, mostly derived from other movies and often senseless."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,Whom do they make these movies for? What exercise in self-deception inspires them to go to such effort and expense for what is obviously going to be a lame exercise in retreadmanship?
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Aside from the racial twist, this is pretty conventional fare, but it's consistently diverting."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Though audiences will leave theaters with an increased appreciation of this pair's talents, they will also leave pondering the perennial Hollywood question: How come so little of interest could be found for performers who are capable of so much more?"
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Benefits from Smith and Lawrence's chemistry. As long as they're on screen together, things breeze along. But when they're apart, the movie flounders."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"There's only so far a movie can go on loud music, nicely-framed shots, testosterone, and adrenaline. Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,It's like a series of cliches exploding in your face.
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks, this one's bad, boys."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"From the swooping aerial shots of downtown Miami, to the long, long-legged beauties that seem to crop up every time the action threatens to slow down, to the nonsensical lack of logic that permeates the film like the acrid odor of wasted cordite, Bad Boys oozes Eighties Hollywood clichés like no film since ""Top Gun."""

Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,75,"You don't believe a second of it, but it's easy to enjoy, partly because of the casting of all three leads."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,75,A legit action movie.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,75,The most entertaining 3-D movie I've ever seen.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,70,"A more unavoidable obstacle here is that there's not much in the way of plot -- the story is in the tour through the labyrinthian intimacies of inner Earth. As such, it's an f/x wizard's dream, and Brevig makes the most of it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,70,"The picture works because Brevig and his actors -- not to mention his effects -- maintain a sense of humor and lightness. It doesn't hurt that Fraser, a fine actor who's made a name for himself not with his serious performances (which are reliably solid) but for his recurring role in the ""Mummy"" series."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,67,"Journey is just the new version of a 1950s comin'-at-ya roller coaster, with a tape measure, trilobite antennae, and giant snapping piranha thrust at the audience."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,67,"It's harmless fun, and it makes for an often impressive display of the latest generation of computer-wizardry. But the enterprise is utterly void of substance: instantly forgettable and about as enriching as a rerun of ""Johnny Quest."""
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,67,It's a thrill ride not to be missed.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"So the science in this film of Jules Verne's science fiction classic is ludicrous. Well, how's the fiction? Not terrible."

Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"This dumbed-down spin on Jules Verne's classic adventure tale was devised as a kid-friendly roller-coaster ride, and it delivers the goods. Whether anyone over the age of eight wants the goods is another matter altogether."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"Not exactly a movie in the usual sense, not exactly a ride, Journey is more of a virtual theme-park simulation and possibly a milestone of immersive entertainment."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"A brisk, undemanding adventure aimed squarely at the family market, Journey is completely passable in 2-D. But viewing it through 3-D glasses not only quadruples the movie's entertainment value, it also explains why characters are constantly thrusting things at the camera."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,63,"For a harmless ""Indiana Jones"" knock-off, Journey to the Center of the Earth has an awful lot riding on it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"It would be barely passable under normal circumstances, but in 3-D it's a circus of excellent FX."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"This first feature by veteran visual effects supervisor Eric Brevig has its transporting, if benign, charms."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"Surprising as it may be, given an unpromising trailer, the 3D update of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth turns out to be perfectly charming as well as predictably eye-popping."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"The cast hits the right notes. Fraser, switching between affable good sport and heroic goofball, clearly doesn't mind this stuff. He realized early on with ""George of the Jungle,"" ""Dudley Do-Right"" and the ""Mummy"" movies that his B-movie build and persona is perfect for live-action cartoons."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,Neither the acting nor the story matters much here; the movie is simply the sum of its 3D effects.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,60,"Many have described ""Journey"" as a 3D film dumbed down to a theme park attraction. However, its visual splendor would have left Walt Disney weeping and Sergei Eisenstein preaching of cinema's second coming."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,58,"Like its early predecessors, it's a nominally fun trip, but it's tissue-thin and instantly forgettable."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,58,"It's inoffensive and shiny and competent and kids will dig it, and I can already barely remember a single thing that happened."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,58,"It has its modicum of suspense, and Brendon Fraser, who stars as intrepid professor Trevor Anderson – who does indeed journey to the center of the Earth – is his usual heroically affable self."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"With 3-D, a little goes a long way and, in the absence of a legitimate script with credible characters, the fun dries up long before the running time has expired."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"Ultimately, Journey to the Center of the Earth's minor-league visual pleasures will be most enjoyed by those with the smallest number of celluloid reference points, preferably those who have started going to the movies after ""Jurassic Park"" or, better yet, the Harry Potter films."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,Not so much a movie as an amusement park ride.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"If this movie is not a ride, then what is it? One thing it may not be, quite, is a movie."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"Eric Brevig, making his feature directing debut after a long career as a visual effects supervisor, lurches from one CG set piece to the next, though he's helped along by Fraser's easy comic touch."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"This is a fairly bad movie, and yet at the same time maybe about as good as it could be. There may not be an 8-year-old alive who would not love it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,50,"As daft, outlandish, and speedy as it needs to be, and, for all its newfangled effects, touchingly old-fashioned in its reverence for the Jules Verne novel that inspired it."
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,40,Provides tepid but fun entertainment.
Journey to the Center of the Earth,5.8,101704370,30,"If the 3D here is better than average, SLIGHTLY, the rest of the movie brings it way, way down--not quite to the center of the earth, but at least a good six feet under."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,83,"Pure, light entertainment."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,80,"The grandeur of the effects--the honest-to-God spectacle of the thing--elevates Monsters vs. Aliens to something approaching art. It's not a masterpiece, but it's most certainly a milestone."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,80,"The richly multilayered picture tends to have a gently immersive effect, akin to a stroll through the world's most expensive diorama."

Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,75,The movie may best be appreciated by people who know the references. All five monsters come from low-budget science fiction films of the 1950s.

Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,"In fact ""nice"" is the adjective that seems to surface most in trying to pin down the film's most salient quality, which means that while the film is enjoyable enough, it is unlikely to become a classic for us, or a ""Shrek"" sort of franchise for DreamWorks."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,70,"Children won't get the references to atomic-age monster movies, but the film offers more than nostalgia: there are slyly funny performances by Seth Rogen as an omnivorous blue blob and Stephen Colbert as the U.S. president, who faces down, and then flees, an alien invasion."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,67,"On some level, the latest DreamWorks CGI project isn't a movie so much as a gag-delivery system wrapped in special effects. The story is crammed with incident, yet completely trifling; there are a ton of personalities, but no real characters."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,63,"Monsters vs. Aliens suffers from the common 3D problems: dim lighting, poor focus in fast-paced action sequences, and too many distractions for the movie to grab the viewer."

Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,58,"The movie works hard -- desperately hard -- to be all things to all audience segments. And the visible effort erodes the sense of gaiety, of unfettered fun."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,55,"After a while, you can see the setups happening -- and once you do, the careening gets predictable. Which gets old, really fast."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,This action-comedy will seem fresh only to 8-year-olds -- though it may give parents an excuse to introduce some of the '50s horror movies it parodies.
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"Has bells and whistles, superb technical sophistication and dazzling visual effects, sound, fury and Reese Witherspoon. What it doesn't have is heart. Like so many vehicles that have popped out from the DreamWorks Animation snark tank, Monsters vs. Aliens is too clever by half."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"The movie is curiously unmemorable, partly because nearly all of its humor depends on your having seen something like it before, even if you haven't."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"Even in 3D, as the picture is being shown in some theaters -- Ginormica is a disappointingly flat character."

Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"The movie is reasonably entertaining, though it helps to be 6 years old."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,50,"As I took off my gray-lensed 3-D spectacles at the end of Monsters vs. Aliens, I felt not so much immersed as fuzzy with exhaustion. What I had seen struck me less as a herald of shining possibility than as a thrill ride back to the future--back, that is, to an idea of the future, and a stale one at that."
Monsters vs. Aliens,6.5,198351526,40,"The misfits, as ever, must take a back seat to the morality, and the result – while in no way migraine-inducing – traffics in rote truisms."

Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,90,Logan's Run is a rewarding futuristic film that appeals both as spectacular-looking escapist adventure as well as intelligent drama.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,75,"Logan's Run is a vast, silly extravaganza that delivers a certain amount of fun, once it stops taking itself seriously."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,70,"Logan's Run is less interested in logic than in gadgets and spectacle, but these are sometimes jazzily effective and even poetic. Had more attention been paid to the screenplay, the movie might have been a stunner."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,70,"Taken for what it is, Logan's Run delivers a fun ride and a glimpse at another era, even if it's probably not the time frame the producers had in mind."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,60,A sci-fi which balances big themes and claustrophobic action with apparent ease.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,50,Hit-and-miss.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,50,"The lavish production has some good effects sequences, but its plot is as corny as the dreadful lurex drape costumes and Jerry Goldsmith's slushy score. Fundamentally, this is just further proof of Hollywood's untiring ability to reduce all science fiction to its most feeble stereotypes."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,40,"A numbing combination of sloppy writing, vulgar art direction, high school acting, and bungled special effects—in short, par for the course for venerable hack Michael Anderson."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,100,"It is the Road Warrior (as it was subtitled for the American release) that remains the definitive Max movie, hard as nails, hell for leather, it lands like a punch to the jaw. Don't drive angry? Yeah, right."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,100,"Part post-apocalyptic Western, part midnight motorcycle flick and part Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is, when you add it all up, a nutty, B-movie masterpiece."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,Miller's choreography of his innumerable vehicles is so extraordinary that it makes Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark look like a kid fooling with Dinky Toys.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,Miller suggests violence; he does not exploit it. He throws the viewer off-balance by mixing the ricochet rhythms of his chase scenes with tableaux of Walpurgisnacht grandeur.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,"Director Miller keeps the pic moving with cyclonic force, photography by Dean Semler is first class, editing is supertight, and Brian May’s music is stirring."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,88,"The experience is frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating. This is very skillful filmmaking, and Mad Max 2 is a movie like no other."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"It's a highly stylized, roaringly dynamic action film that shuns plot and characterization in favor of a crazy iconographical melange—it's like the work of a western punk trucker de Sade...The climactic chase, with its deft variation of tempo and point of view, is a minor masterpiece."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"Gibson is surprisingly uncharismatic, but Miller makes up for it with whizz bang action."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"In its stripped-down, cannily cinematic way, it's one of the most imaginative Australian films yet released in this country. It has no pretensions to do anything except entertain in the primitive, occasionally jolting fashion of the first nickelodeon movies, whose audiences flinched as streetcars lumbered silently toward the camera."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a straightforward action/adventure film, filled to the brim with over-the-top chases and stunts."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,70,"If there's one thing going for Last Action Hero, it's the construction of it all. Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"For all of its sensational stunts and flashes of wit, however, Last Action Hero plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through. It doesn't evoke the mystery of the barrier between audience and screen the way Woody Allen did, and a lot of the time it simply seems to be standing around commenting on itself."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"Last Action Hero is something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one. It tries to be too many things to too many different kinds of audiences, the result being that it will probably confuse, and perhaps even alienate, the hard-core action fans."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"The movie isn't mindless; it just has a mind that's a bit junky and muddled. And to their credit, Arnold and his collaborators haven't played it safe. Last Action Hero is a stretch. Unfortunately, it's a stretch that proves the star wasn't that elastic to begin with."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"The performances of both Schwarzenegger and O'Brien are labored, the pacing uneven, and maybe only half the gags work, but there's a certain amount of creative energy and audacity mixed in with all the confusion."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"This is an attempt to be both a high-octane actionfest and a satire on such films, the result of which is the weirdest concoction: the metaphysical blockbuster. No wonder it tanked."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"The film tries so very hard to be The Movie of Summer '93 that it almost makes you sick for what could have been, what should have been, and, in the end, what it is: soulless sound and fury -- action in a vacuum."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"Last Action Hero is sporadically entertaining, but it could have been a whole lot more. Trimmed down and better edited, this film might have been a top-notch satire. As it is, however, it gets caught someplace in between action and comedy, and never really comes across as a solid example of either."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,50,"Hero claims to be a gentle, playful parody of the action/adventure genre, but comes off as a mercenary attempt to cash in on summer movie-going habits."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,50,"Last Action Hero makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience (and itself) that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness. In a sense, the movie's incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,40,"There are all sorts of noteworthy people in this silly vampire epic, including acting greats Sir Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin, but the only artist this critic wants to heap praise upon is the regrettably unidentified Supervisor of Blood Splatter: Nice work, dude."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,40,"The only thing left unsliced is the ham in BloodRayne, yet another video game adaptation by German genre specialist Uwe Boll and a movie with more fading - or faded - talent than an Italian basketball team."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,33,"With minimal flare and maximal gore, Boll simply delivers the turgid drama and incompetently staged action sequences that have made him the unstoppable Big Boss of the gaming community."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,30,"Attention, Ben Kingsley (I mean, Sir Ben Kingsley): It's officially time to turn in your Oscar."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,30,"Our blood-smacking antiheroine, Rayne (Kristanna Loken), isn't a vampire; she's a dhampir, a half-human, half-vampire cross-fiend who's as anguished, strange, and sloppy as mercenaries, or movies, get."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,30,"Just when you thought camp was dead, along comes this bizarre cross between a Tarantino knockoff and a Hammer horror film."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,Yet another ill-conceived big screen videogame adaptation.
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,Why do moviegoers and gamers keep going to see video-game-based movies when neither group is ever happy with the results?
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,"While there's no fun in mediocrity, ludicrousness is another matter. Boll is the best at what he does, and what he does is make truly terrible films."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,25,Semicoherent.
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,20,Anemic action-fantasy.
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,0,"Maybe everyone involved was hoping that no one would see this movie, but Madsen is the only one who should fear anyone seeing his work."
BloodRayne,2.9,2405420,0,Ghastly-bad.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,91,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a tremendous piece of pop entertainment, smart and engaging and featuring a home run movie star lead performance by Chris Evans."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"In his third outing as the Captain, Evans seems totally comfortable in the role. He manages to convey his character’s goodness without making him seem like a self-righteous stiff. There’s an ease in his performance, and a sense of humor that makes him very appealing."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,What it comes down to is the difference between spectacle and craftsmanship. The Winter Soldier has plenty of the former – every dollar of its estimated $170-million (U.S.) budget is onscreen – but it’s also got an intricate dramatic and thematic structure holding everything in place.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"The rare film in this genre that serves as both entry point and continuation. For a change, you can walk in cold and you won't be too lost."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier neatly and entertainingly puts into motion some big changes in the Marvel universe, while still sticking to its own charms — no easy feat, but one fit for a hero."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"Co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and the team of screenwriters have fashioned a story with just the right balance of superhero fun, nods to the greater Marvel Universe and genuine dramatic tension."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,86,"The newest Marvel blockbuster-to-be boasts an array of well-cast leads and supporting characters; a crisply paced, sensible plot; and above-average dialogue. Even more importantly, every scene and every character interaction prove that the movie’s creative team truly understands the core appeal of Cap himself—the tone of not just the character, but the comic book series from which he springs."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"By far the best Part Two in the universe (not necessarily hard to achieve) it also rests at the franchise’s peak alongside Iron Man, Avengers, and its predecessor to show the viability of cinematic serials."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"This sequel is, by design, entirely absorbing and satisfying without being one whit memorable."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"The best Marvel film since ""The Avengers."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,The creators of Captain America: The Winter ­Soldier have brought off something fresh and bold.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"Despite some of its more rickety story elements, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is possibly the studio's best action film and the one most able to stand on its own since the original ""Iron Man."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"This entry won't win any new converts, but anyone already invested in this series is going to have a blast."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"What makes ""The Winter Soldier"" so enjoyable, though, and what will make it so profitable, is its emotional bandwidth — all the vivid, nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,Steve and the movie still fly high through plot twists and cool stunts.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"Count Captain America: The Winter Soldier as another success in the Marvel line. Thanks to the chemistry between Evans and Johansson and a willingness to shake things up, it's more than just a placeholder between ""Avenger"" films."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"The script is solid, and the fight scenes are excellent."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"Parents, take note: For all its heart, this is a tougher, more morally complex movie than its predecessors. Young kids carrying their miniversions of Cap’s famous shield may be in for a jolt."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"This installment delivers a heavy and welcome dose of paranoia, administered between fleetly paced smackdowns."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"It may climax with an overly formulaic splurge, but The Winter Soldier benefits from an old-school-thriller tone that, for its first half at least, distinguishes it from its more obviously superheroic Marvel cousins."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"In the first movie, an injection transformed wimpy Steve Rogers into strapping Captain America; similarly, this sequel gives the flagging comic-book movie an adrenaline shot of relevance. You've got to hand it to them."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"With a string of gratifying action sequences, and a breakneck pace leavened by a frequently witty script, The Winter Soldier stands alone as a solidly entertaining blockbuster."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"If we must endure yet another spring-summer cycle of comic book superheroes, this movie at least delivers the wham-bang goods (recycled though they may be)."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"It tells its own story and, unlike with ""Thor 2"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" we don't feel the absence of the rest of the team."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,An often breathlessly exciting action thriller told with humor and intelligence.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"The new film isn’t nearly as bleak as Christopher Nolan’s take on Batman (in general, Marvel seems more risk-averse when it comes to fiddling with the crown jewels), but it still creates an action-movie landscape torn between patriotic ideals and harsh post-9/11 realpolitik."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"The movie does its duty. It's a reliable commodity, delivered efficiently and well, like pizza."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is every rousing, whup-ass thing you want in an escapist adventure."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"A baggy, at times brutal conglomeration of surprisingly deep character development and aggressively percussive action, The Winter Soldier is a comic-book movie only in its provenance."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"It's a heady blend, at times requiring more speechifying than throwaway pop deserves. But it keeps one guessing between ill-staged and frenetically edited fight scenes. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo handle vehicular mayhem better."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"Beneath the expensive, computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing, old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/11 world."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"It needs to seem cool enough that we want to watch it despite its obvious silliness, and viewed through that prism of canny analysis, the craftsmanship of “Winter Soldier” is first rate."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"Arriving in the middle of Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Winter Soldier is among the best of the nine films released so far—roughly on par with the first Iron Man and The Avengers—but if the film has one major flaw, it’s the obligation to serve a larger franchise that keeps taking on weight."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"For sheer plotting and audience involvement, this is a notch above any of the other Avengers-feeding Marvel entries, the one that feels most like a real movie rather than a production line of ooh-and-ahh moments for fanboys."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,It’s to the credit of the Russos that they give the characters such room to breathe in a movie that easily might have been about rushing from one gargantuan setpiece to the next.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,67,"At over two hours, The Winter Soldier could have easily been trimmed by a good 20 minutes, but if it’s spectacular imagery and duplicitous goings-on that you crave, the film will not disappoint."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,67,"The Winter Soldier is probably in the upper tier of Marvel pictures in terms of quality, but ultimately proves too muddled and frantic to match the heights of ""The Avengers."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"The problem with Captain America: The Winter Soldier is that there's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"With his glorified Frisbee and good-guy smile, Evans is engaging, but “The Winter Soldier” might be stronger with a little less Captain and a little more America."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"It’s OK for April, in other words, but not up to the higher standards of a Marvel summer blockbuster."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,60,So here's what moviegoers can trust from the Russo's Captain America: Winter Solider: They can trust it to be a brisk ride. They can trust it to be entertaining. They can expect it to be suspenseful.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,60,"You can’t help but feel disappointed that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"Given how little creative wiggle room there is in properties like The Winter Soldier, it’s a minor triumph that the Russos imprint any personality on the movie, which is less a stand-alone work than a part of an ever-expanding multimedia enterprise."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"The most memorable element of The Winter Soldier, besides Redford, is probably Scarlett Johansson, whose dryly funny Natasha at times comes perilously close to being … a well-developed female character?"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"Has the usual overlong running time, the half-hearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"It's a product of the highest quality, but at the end of the day that's what it is: a machine-made, assembly-line product whose strengths tend to feel like items checked off a master list rather than being the result of any kind of individual creative touch."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,Deeply mediocre and ultra-predictable.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,38,"Despite one or two moments of Venture Brothers-worthy fancy, the film is as by-the-numbers as any this series has ever offered."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,100,"Anyone expecting gritty realism will be disappointed, because Hill is offering something better: shooting entirely on NY locations at night, he has transformed the city into a phantasmagoric labyrinth of weird tribes in fantastic dress and make-up who move over (and under) the streets as untouched as troglodytes by the civilisation sleeping around them. Mixing ironic humour, good music, and beautifully photographed suspense, it's one of the best of 1979."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,100,"For me personally, It’s one film that can’t be redone for the simple fact, there isn’t a living director that can capture what made this movie work! If you’ve never seen this film, I can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s definitely in my TOP 5 of “All time greatest movies.”"
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,90,"The Warriors is a deeply silly movie. Its gangs are ridiculous comic-book figures. Still, director Walter Hill treats its world with total seriousness. Bleak synthesizer drones thrum and throb. The streets glow with slickly inky-black greasiness. Nobody smiles. It’s so awesome."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,80,"The Warriors is a visual feast. Director Hill fills the frame with vibrant colors, bright lights, and nonstop motion. The uniforms of the various gangs are unique, funny, fearsome, and more than a bit theatrical. The exciting fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and instead of focusing on the violence, Hill concentrates on pure movement (most of the cast were actually dancers)."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"The Warriors is a gangland fantasia, cut tighter than a snare drum, made for maximum impact."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"Hill, shooting by night and on location together with his OOP Andrew Laszlo, gives the film dazzling style. New York's oil-slicked streets become a labyrinth lit by pools of reflecting light, both scary and strangely beautiful - grimy realism it isn't. It also manages to humanize the gang-bangers to a surprising extent, illustrating the material and emotional poverty that forces them onto the streets in the first place."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"The Warriors is a comic book morality tale, Westside Story crossed with A Clockwork Orange. The movie is so perversely fascinating in a variety of ways that it’s too bad the imagination demonstrated wasn’t used for something better than what turns out to be one more exploitation film in which the audience is encouraged to cheer the sights and sounds of mayhem."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"The film is as handsome to watch as it is preposterous to listen to, full of gorgeous nocturnal city images that splash blaring neon colors against filthy, rain-slicked gray. Mr. Hill uses subways, jukeboxes, spectacularly eerie costumes and deserted streets to create a stark yet extravagant visual style, and a grimy little world in which everything looks curiously brand-new. Thanks to a lot of wipes and slow-motion shots, you are never in danger of forgetting that somebody clever is at the helm."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"Walter Hill's existential action piece, rendered in a complete stylistic abstraction that will mean tough going for literal-minded audiences. Not quite the clean, elegant creation that his earlier films were, The Warriors admits to failures of conception (occasional) and dialogue (frequent), but there is much of value in Hill's visual elaboration of the material."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"Theme of the pic, based on Sol Yurick’s 1965 novel, is a variation on countless westerns and war films. Update the setting to modern-day New York, and the avenues of escape to graffiti-emblazoned subway cars, and that’s The Warriors."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"The Warriors is a real peculiarity, a movie about street gang warfare, written and directed as an exercise in mannerism. There's hardly a moment when we believe that the movie's gangs are real or that their members are real people or that they inhabit a real city. That's where the peculiarity comes in: I don't think we're supposed to. No matter what impression the ads give, this isn't even remotely intended as an action film. It's a set piece. It's a ballet of stylized male violence."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"If the movie is not as dangerous as its detractors claim, neither is it as glorious and memorable as some of its less discriminating admirers would have it. I find the spectacle fading from my memory in a jumble of dislocated colors and motions. In retrospect, it seems too studiously unreal."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,80,"Keeps playing its two winning cards over and over again, and is smart enough to realise they are more than enough. The first is the giant animal carnage itself, which crackles with fun ideas and flourishes throughout. The second is the comic chemistry of a superbly picked cast who bring everyone in on the joke."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,75,"What makes Rampage especially enjoyable is the way it sneaks up on the audience. Before casting off every shred of dignity and abandoning itself to good-humored excess, the movie passes itself off as a reasonably serious science-fiction movie."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,72,"The filmmakers try to innovate largely by making the movie as toothless and easily digestable as possible. Nothing in the film is real enough to care about past the moment, or serious enough to trouble audience’s sleep. Maybe in a world that’s already full of real-life disasters, it’s innovative enough to make monumental destruction this much dumb, lightweight fun."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,70,"It takes some time for the action sequences to fully engage, but from about the movie’s midpoint, Peyton delivers a succession of staggering set pieces."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,67,This crazy-gleeful adventure jumps between grisly and cartoonish.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,67,"Johnson’s singular charisma—his way with a one-liner, the built-in special effect of his unreal physique—grounds Rampage in a consistent personality, even as the tone veers wildly from broadly comic to selectively sentimental to casually horrifying."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"When Johnson is doing that movie action star thing he does so well and giant animals are going enormous-mano-a-enormous-mano, there’s undeniably goofy fun to be had. You just have to be patient during the downtime."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"It’s big, bloated, and, if you give in to the familiar charms of its jacked leading man, not unenjoyable. (Alternately, you could easily just let it induce a little nap.)"
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"The engaging dynamic between our hero and his gargantuan, computer-generated pal is the movie’s best surprise, with silly and straight bits both working mostly as intended for director Brad Peyton (Johnson’s “Journey 2” and “San Andreas”)."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"Only two things need to be said about Rampage: It’s really terrible, and I enjoyed it immensely."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"Per usual, Johnson is the key cog of a movie built for his physical presence, but it's the relationship between Davis and George that fuels the plot, even when everything around them gets convoluted and haphazard."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Not that you would anyway, but it doesn't pay to think too hard about ""Rampage."" Sure, it could be improved (shorter would have helped), but it gets the job done in a more or less acceptable way. Not the highest praise, but things could have been worse."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Rampage was always going to be the cinematic equivalent of junk food – enjoyable enough while consumed, but devoid of nourishment. When the homo sapiens are on screen, you can feel the film start to flatline but, against the odds, a computer-generated gorilla might just win you over."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"It is entertainingly over the top, although perhaps the CGI work isn’t quite out of the top drawer."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Ridiculous, of course, but not as ridiculous as it might have been. As much fun as it has with the idea of animals stomping cities to rubble, it seems shy of going completely over the top, and it’s the poorer for it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Rampage won’t set the world on fire (our world, at least; it sets plenty of its world on fire when George and his two giant pals arrive in Chicago), but it does exactly what it says on the tin: It’s a big, goofy romp about creatures who lay waste to a major American city while the Rock cracks jokes in a light brown shirt."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,Morgan's performance is a gem of comic timing and audience-directed winks. He elevates a movie that’s mostly about watching stuff get stomped down.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,55,"Rampage doesn’t really offer much of anything new as a giant monster movie, a video game adaptation, or a Dwayne Johnson vehicle, but it still checks all the boxes expected from it, offering one just enough entertainment value to not make you completely hate it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"It’s both a blindingly predictable pastiche of an action movie — absolutely nothing happens here that you haven’t seen in a movie before, with the possible exception of some crass sign-language humor from a giant gorilla — and weirdly charming."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"Clearly, this is a star vehicle — and the eminently likable Johnson is unquestionably a star. Through sheer force of personality, he elevates Rampage into something reasonably entertaining."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,It's easy to root for George. The movie deserves the finger.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"The problem with Rampage is that it’s not content to be mindless fun. There’s too much exposition and too many needless human villains. Plus, the tone is more lugubrious than the flippancy suggested by the trailers."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"In the right moments, Brad Peyton can stage a ceremoniously ludicrous set piece with grace and ease. It’s easy to follow the nonsense found in the last act thanks to his assured hand, and you can tell that he is having an absolute ball with its silliness. If only we could share in that enthusiasm for its tedious first two acts."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"The gargantuan critters are dwarfed only by the derivativeness in Rampage, a clunky spectacle that, like many Dwayne Johnson vehicles, is elevated by his charismatic presence but not enough to recommend it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,46,This is a ridiculous movie without much desire or energy to get too ridiculous.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,42,"It never makes up its mind whether it wants to be a what-hath-science-wrought disaster movie like those old John Sayles cheapie classics Piranha and Alligator, or just a big, dumb, and loud tongue-in-cheek action comedy. It’s a movie that’s afraid to pick a lane."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"The bulk of Rampage is, alas, a slog, as passionless as I’d imagine the fandom is for the I.P. the film is based on."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Rampage is noticeably in trouble once it becomes obvious that the giant virtual gorilla is the most human presence onscreen, and that doesn’t take too long."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Compared to Rampage, King Kong and Godzilla have James Brown levels of soul. Peyton has just made another movie about the Rock running through rubble."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Seriously, the movie is pretty awful, but Johnson, as ever, seems to be having a ball, even when he’s all serious and concerned and shot up and beaten up and building-dropped-upon."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,The movie is at its best when it’s sopping with sentimentality and when it goes right over the top in its depiction of dorky destruction. Everything in between is a drag.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Some movies are feasts. Some films are desserts. This picture is cheese in a can, and if it only accepted that, it would be a lot more fun — like “Alligator,” the tongue-in-cheek classic that had a toothy terror climbing out of a city sewer."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Peyton delivers a unified-looking whole, in which the visual effects integrate well with stage and location work."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Rampage is a movie that gets buried in its own top-heavy plot, collapsing itself under that weight just like the Chicago-area buildings do on screen."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,A hopelessly bland and bizarrely self-serious monster movie.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,"Rampage might not be the worst movie of the year so far, but it’s a contender for most pointless."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,"Unlike 2014’s Godzilla, which benefited from director Gareth Edwards’s patience with the Jaws-style slow burn, RAMPAGE is all noise without crescendo."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,Rampage is a drag.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,37,"At times, Rampage almost hides its problems. It’s just funny enough, just exciting enough and just visually impressive enough. What it never is, though, is anything more than just enough."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,33,"It’s the worst kind of ridiculous: not enough so to be memorably fun, but far too much so to be taken with any degree of gravitas."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"The plot is cursory, the dialogue is repetitive and the psychology is cheap. Hanging in for the wanton violence may prove too much for anyone not seriously addicted to the guilty pleasures of cheesy sci-fi."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"It’s not convincing, not impressive, and after “Jumanji,” Johnson’s agents will probably never let him within a city block of Brad Peyton."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"What does Rampage have? No satisfying action beats, no memorable images, and so little to say that it’s virtually impossible to say anything about it in return. It’s not a movie for critics, that much is clear. The problem is that it’s not for anyone else, either."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"Rampage is a big, noisy nothing—an action extravaganza that fails at being funny just as hard as it fails at being serious."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"I’m not terribly convinced that the overtly campy version of this film would be any better, but I’m very certain that this one is bad."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"You know what might make an intriguing, revealing movie? The story of how, over 30 years after its debut, a relatively innocent arcade game starring a giant ape and other oversize beasts underwent a corporate transmogrification and became a turgid, logy sci-fi/action blockbuster."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,91,It sheds the series' famous and influential pastel look and plunges its cast of villains and warriors into the 21st century.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,90,"Mann has done something transformative with Farrell: The Irish actor has never had this much charisma and natural authority in a role, and as he navigates that gray area between Crockett's real identity and his fabricated one, revealing subtle fissures in the character's cocksure facade, he's fascinating to watch."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,88,"If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,88,"Miami Vice isn't an action flick but a neo-noir: tough, quiet, moody and hard."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,88,"Sensual and scary, the movie is so visually textured you feel as though you're brushing against the screen."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,83,"While it never approaches the richness and gravity of a great Mann film like ""Heat,"" Miami Vice blurs the thin blue line to similar effect, and he features a couple of bravura setpieces, including a tense raid on an enemy hideout and a shootout with chaotic, you-are-there immediacy. If only all summer movies were this majestically slight."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,83,Right away in Miami Vice you know you're waist-deep in movieland.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"It's a sensational trip -- gorgeous, gaga."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"Mixing pop savvy with startling formal ambition, Mr. Mann transforms what is essentially a long, fairly predictable cop-show episode into a dazzling (and sometimes daft) Wagnerian spectacle."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"The world according to Mann is loud, dangerous, morally ambiguous, and more than a little greasy, but during the hours you spend there, there's nowhere you'd rather be."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"Bearing all the Mann hallmarks, this is visually enthralling, relentlessly stylish crime drama. A little too languorous for its own good at times, but still vastly superior entertainment."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"The two best words to describe the 2006 motion picture Miami Vice are ""stylish"" and ""intense."""
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,"As entertaining as some of it is, is so cool that it's almost too cool. It takes the sin, and much of the juice, out of vice."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,"This is more of a thinking man's action flick -- a small, intense film made on a giant canvas that finds Mann experimenting with and pushing at the boundaries of mainstream filmmaking."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,"Unlike most TV-to-movie transitions, Mann returns to his roots and delivers what amounts to a slightly overblown episode, brimming with style and characteristically short on substance."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,70,"Without the ability to move off the mythic, without the emotional texture that ""Heat"" created, it is a film easier to admire than to get passionately involved with."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,70,"Mann turns Miami Vice into an exploration of tone and mood, and he makes that enough."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,70,"As it turns out, the movie is still very much about two well-dressed undercover cops who strike sexy poses, express plenty of attitude and drive expensive cars and fast boats as pop music plays on the soundtrack and palm trees sway gently in the tropical night."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,67,It's got some great action sequences and is peppered with genuinely dazzling images. It's also subtly infused with Mann's favored themes of men-at-work and the high price of loyalty to duty. But it hasn't got sufficient meat to warrant its draggy length.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,67,It's refreshing to hear some old-fashioned percussive tension in service of a director who knows what he's doing. Even when the screenwriter is losing his way.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"Just when the plot should start coming together, the pacing goes slack and the narrative gets bogged down in routine cop-movie clichés."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"Miami Vice is the last of the predicted summer blockbusters, and it delivers a
reasonable amount of popcorn excitement. But if nostalgia for the TV show is the
source of your interest, expect some disappointment."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"A combination of muddy sound mix and players with heavy accents (particularly Chinese superstar Gong, who seems to have learned her lines phonetically) renders large swaths of dialogue incomprehensible, but the details of what's being said and done don't really matter."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"It's about guns and sex and fast boats, and, baffling as it is at times, it's still the kind of brutal fantasy that many of us relish a great deal more than yet another aerated digital dream."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,60,"Dark, detailed and only really gets going when the gunplay starts."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,60,"A darker, grittier creature that, while benefiting considerably from Dion Beebe's HD cinematography, is a frustratingly inert affair -- a long and talky excursion that fails to engage the viewer from the outset."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"It's filled with Mann's signature macho verisimilitude, but essentially it's the stuff of what, in saner fiscal times, would have been a B movie. Miami Vice delivers the thrills, atmosphere and romance it promises, but it doesn't resonate like major Mann."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Miami Vice, the movie, is an atmospheric muddle, as gorgeous and unintelligible as raven-haired stunner Gong Li."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Farrell appears to be a rarity in undercover culture, a vice cop who goes on the lowdown as an Irish beatnik. Oh, that's a good disguise for South Beach. As for Foxx, he's still channeling Ray Charles through squinty eyes and a kind of shaky head. They have zero chemistry."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Apart from a few sleek shots involving boats or helicopters, the action eventually devolves into a standard war-movie shootout."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,It's the supporting players who stand out.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Far from a disaster, but doesn't rank with Mann's best work."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"If you really must see Miami Vice (and you mustn't), buy a ticket to something better, then slip into ""Vice"" at the 95-minute mark and watch the last third of the movie. No one involved will profit by your curiosity, and you won't miss a thing of importance."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,38,"All this movie has in common with its ancestor are speedboats, shotguns and drug-dealing Colombians."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,38,"Perhaps vice isn't what it used to be, or maybe Crockett and Tubbs just aren't all that interesting when removed from their appropriate time slot, but this may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8.0,3981000,100,"Only a spirited and extravagant production could do justice to the Robin Hood legend; this film is more than equal to the task. Korngold's score won a well-deserved Oscar, as did the editing and art direction."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8.0,3981000,100,"Robin Hood is movie pageantry at its best, done in the grand manner of silent spectacles, brimming over with the sort of primitive energy that drew people to the movies in the first place."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8.0,3981000,100,"Made with sublime innocence and breathtaking artistry, at a time when its simple values rang true."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8.0,3981000,90,"Film is done in the grand manner of silent-day spectacles with sweep and breadth of action, swordplay and hand-to-hand battles between Norman and Saxon barons."
The Adventures of Robin Hood,8.0,3981000,75,"Is it a silly movie? At times, yes. Is it creaky and blatant and obvious? Quite often, absolutely. But should you miss it in this splendidly colorful restoration? Not on your life."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,40,"Director Russell Mulcahy can’t seem to decide from one scene to the next whether he’s making a sci-fi, thriller, horror, music video or romance – end result is a mishmash."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,38,"About halfway through the violent, fantasy adventure Highlander, one character talks about how it was the custom during ancient times to throw babies into a pit of hungry dogs. Well, there were more than a few times during this hyperviolent film in which I felt as if I were a baby being thrown to a dog of a movie."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,38,"Since none of the characters makes sense even on the movie's own terms, Highlander keeps on exploding for almost two hours, with nothing at stake."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,90,"For Your Eyes Only bears not the slightest resemblance to the Ian Fleming novel of the same title, but emerges as one of the most thoroughly enjoyable of the 12 Bond pix [to date] despite fact that many of the usual ingredients in the successful 007 formula are missing."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,75,"For Your Eyes Only is a solid adventure, although it could have been better. There's enough action to hold those with even a short attention span, and Roger Moore's deft charm hasn't yet begun to wear thin."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,75,"The success of this picture (perhaps Moore's best in the Bond series) can be attributed to the marvelous direction of Glen, who had previously worked as a second-unit director on earlier Bond movies. Not surprisingly, the stunts are some of the best in the series."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,"Most of the time, though, For Your Eyes Only is a slick entertainment...not the spaced-out fun that ""Moonraker"" was, but its tone is consistently comic even when the material is not."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,Glen's style...goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,"For Your Eyes Only is a competent James Bond thriller, well-crafted, a respectable product from the 007 production line. But it's no more than that."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,50,"To evaluate For Your Eyes Only and the other Bond movies, it helps to think of them not as, say, different vintages of a fine Bordeaux but as successive models off the Pontiac assembly line. In one vehicle there may be an annoying ping in the engine of narrative; in another the dialogue may be as sleek as Genuine Corinthian Leather. But all meet the same standards of speed, styling and emotion control. If there is no Rolls-Royce in the Bond series, there is also no Pinto."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,50,"Moore just looks confused. He obviously wants to do his thing then hit the bar for cocktails, but John Glen is nagging him to add a roughness to the slick exterior. Equally, it just doesn’t fit. The news is clear, there’s only so far you can push a Bond before it breaks."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,40,Eyes is somehow too relaxing to be satisfying.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,40,"Worth a try, but without his Art Dept clothes on, Bond is like the naked Emperor. Look, Ma, no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,100,"There are gripping chases and balletic combat scenes, painstakingly realised by Oshii’s animators, but the mood is mostly cold and melancholic, as Kusanagi broods over the fleshly implications of living in a world of data"
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,88,"Technically, Ghost in the Shell is astonishing, not only for its smooth meld of cell animation and state-of-the-art computer animation, but also for its imaginative storytelling and mood-setting (thanks to an eerie, non-thumping score by Kenji Kawai)."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,88,"For a movie that’s so photo-realistic in its backgrounds and detailed in its character design, Ghost In The Shell is just as effective when it goes minimal, suggesting presence through absence."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,88,"The plot is impossibly dense and the characters – perhaps appropriately – feel like little more than cyphers, but for sheer mind-expanding sci-fi strangeness this is hard to beat."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,80,"It is a dizzying, headspinning film, replete with violence, alienation and tech-porn. I confess I find it too opaque to make the kind of investment that would qualify me as a real fan. But it should be seen."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,80,"Most alluring are the crumbling neon cityscapes, real world/cyberspace fusion and the musings on identity."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,80,"From its baddie-eviscerating opening sequence through innumerable car chases, shoot outs and tongue-in-cheek dialogue exchanges, this is exactly the kind of film that James Cameron would make if they ever let him through the Disney front gates."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,80,"The ghost of anime can be seen here trying to dive into the shell of the movie mainstream. But this particular film is too complex and murky to reach a large audience, I suspect; it's not until the second hour that the story begins to reveal its meaning. But I enjoyed its visuals, its evocative soundtrack (including a suite for percussion and heavy breathing), and its ideas."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,80,Mamoru Oshii's direction deftly merges gritty realism with a dreamlike quality. The only problem is that the characters reel off their existential speeches with such harried deadpan that it's hard to tell whether the angst is serious or tongue-in-cheek.
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,75,Oshii is able to knit together action sequences with extraordinary power and conviction.... Ghost in the Shell is absolutely terrific.
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,75,"Less spectacular but more effectively atmospheric than Akira, Ghost in the Shell should gratify anime buffs and may well hook the uninitiated."
Kôkaku Kidôtai,8.0,515905,75,Ghost in the Shell is a slick but plodding recycling of tired cyberpunk clichés that adds nothing new to the genre.
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,90,"But no, Lethal Weapon 2 is no artless, autopiloted waste of precious movie-theater air conditioning. It's fun stuff -- crackling, playfully escapist summer fare that doesn't make you feel taken advantage of later."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,88,Lethal Weapon 2 is that rarity - a sequel with most of the same qualities as the original. I walked into the movie with a certain dread. But this is a film with the same off-center invention and wild energy as the original.
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,83,"In the wake of Lethal Weapon, producers across Hollywood had started running the buddy-cop concept into the ground, which made 1989’s Lethal Weapon 2 a reminder of how to do this schtick right, with just as much emphasis on loose character interaction as on violent action."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"Lethal Weapon, that BMW of buddy movies, spawns Lethal Weapon 2, a blacktop-blistering bad-guy-getter that's nearly twice as much fun."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"Before it skids out of control in the final sequence, the film is so careful to preserve its successful comic-action formula that it follows the most basic law of sequels. If you liked ''Lethal Weapon,'' you'll like Lethal Weapon 2; it's almost as simple as that."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"Loaded with the usual elements, Lethal Weapon 2 benefits from a consistency of tone that was lacking in the first film. This time, screenwriter Jeffrey Boam and director Richard Donner have wisely trained their sights on humor and the considerable charm of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's onscreen rapport."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,"The movie overall may be routine, but Donner gives it some spark and polish."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,80,Unlike most sequels Lethal Weapon 2 is neither predictable nor conventional. It's just pumped full of juice.
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"But while the story may not be especially memorable, Jeffrey Boam’s brisk screenplay and Donner’s workmanlike direction keep things moving enough to gather enough momentum in preparation for Gibson’s third-act, tear-down-the-house rampage."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"Returning director Richard Donner seems to have smoothed over the few stylistic rough edges remaining from the earlier film to deliver here two hours of pure, breathless, high-impact entertainment."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"If there is one thing that I've learned from Stephen Spielberg, and George Lucas it's that the easiest way to win an audience is to employ an antagonist that everyone hates, like the Nazis, or Stormtroopers. Producers Richard Donner and Joel Silver take a lesson in the first sequel to Lethal Weapon and pit Gibson and Glover against fascist dimplomatically-immune South Africans."
Lethal Weapon 2,7.2,147253986,75,"By concentrating on the often frustrating, funny relationship between the three men, the film gains in humour but loses some of the momentum and panache which distinguished the original."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,88,"The new film is a fast, funny, engagingly unpretentious 88 minutes that, moving between martial-arts dustups and random satirical jibes, achieves a more successful mix of action and humor than the first. There is plenty for adults here as well as children."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,75,"This lacks the darkness and subtlety that makes the first film so good, and so adult, but its simplified plot and gags will appeal to the under tens."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,63,"Neither as fun nor as faithful to the spirit of the original comics. It’s a bigger, slicker movie, but not a better one."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,60,"One can have a reasonably amusing time with this predictable sequel, which is a bit longer on action and shorter on wit and character than the original (hence less good, in my opinion), but still diverting and harmless enough."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,58,"Retains the essential elements that first turned the world Turtle - the affectionate squabbling between the four, the pantomime villains, the cracking one-liners - and the bigger budget is a blessing."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"A reasonably entertaining blend of Three Stooges and Bugs Bunny, using gracefully choreographed martial-arts slapstick without any infantile sound effects."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"The humor, which made the first movie appealing to more than just TV kids, is far less adroit."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"This slap-- sequel is primarily for the cognoscenti -- that is, for other teen-age mutant ninja turtles, or very small children. The rest of us it happily ignores."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"If the Turtles insist on remaining a mainstream box-office attraction, at least they've now had the decency to make a mainstream movie."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"Though Turtles II suffers from a lack of novelty and an aimless screenplay, the bottom line is that the pic won't disappoint its core subteen audience."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"In most ways, a sequel-as-usual: a little warmer, with slightly less zip and flurry."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"If the new film is considerably less imaginative than your average Punch-and-Judy show, it is, nevertheless, a step up from last year's turtle-fest."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,"Today's kids are learning from the Turtles that the world is a sinkhole of radioactive waste, that it's more reassuring to huddle together in sewers than take your chances competing at street level, and that individuality is dangerous. Cowabunga."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,6.0,78656813,50,The movie slogs along in between combat scenes. Only a precious few of the bantering jokes among the green quartet hold any amusement for those over the age of 10.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"Mel Gibson is always good for a surprise, and his latest is that Apocalypto is a remarkable film. Set in the waning days of the Mayan civilization, the picture provides a trip to a place one's never been before, offering hitherto unseen sights of exceptional vividness and power."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"For those of us who prefer to judge Gibson solely in terms of his art, the movie is a virtuosic piece of action cinema -- particularly in its second half...And while there has been no shortage of recent films that decry the horrors of war and man's inhumanity to his fellow man, I know of none other quite this sickeningly powerful."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"The production design is superb, and the actors deliver their dialogue in subtitled Yucatecan Maya, but despite all the anthropological drag, this is really just a crackerjack Saturday-afternoon serial."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,91,"For all its excesses, it's an absorbing, disturbing, savagely beautiful ""trip"" movie, and an extraordinary -- perhaps even outrageous -- personal vision of the one A-list filmmaker who truly deserves the adjective ""maverick."""
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,90,"Gibson may not be much of a deep thinker, but he's a heck of a storyteller. Apocalypto turns out to be not a case of Montezuma's revenge but of Gibson's: It's something entirely unexpected, a sinewy, taut poem of action."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,Gibson has made a film of blunt provocation and bruising beauty.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"Barbarously beautiful and gut-wrenchingly (literally) violent, it's a mesmerizing vision of the past refracted through the dark obsessions of the present."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"Awe-inspiring and harrowing, vile and beautiful, as wild and mesmerizing as the Mexican jungle in which it is filmed and one of the most relentlessly thrilling films of the year."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"The heart of the matter - and the viscera - is the action, and one man's determination to survive. Apocalypto is primal."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"The best thing I can say about Apocalypto is that, despite belonging to an overpopulated genre, it's unlike any other movie to reach theaters this year and, because it is as visual an experience as it is visceral, it is best seen on a large screen."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,83,"The whole film is too reliant on action-movie cuts and zooms, plus James Horner's insistent score, but it's beautifully rendered and convincingly exciting."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,The guy knows how to make a heart-pounding movie; he just happens to be a cinematic sadist.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"The film is mostly successful in transporting the viewer to another age: the costumes, the body markings, the fierce Mayan masks, all feel right. And keeping the dialogue in subtitles was a smart move. Even better are the faces, which never fail to fascinate. But for all the anthropological research that went into the movie, what is Apocalypto trying to say?"
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"Apocalypto turns into the best ""Rambo"" movie ever made. The worrisome part is that Gibson doesn't think he's making a boneheaded action picture. For him, torture and vengeance are the way of the world. This is Gibsonian metaphysics."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"That is the thing about Gibson, fool that he is in other ways: he has learned how to tell a tale, and to raise a pulse in the telling. You have to admire that basic gift, uncommon as it is in Hollywood these days."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"Apocalypto is a dazzling achievement. Not only does it showcase a civilization little seen on the silver screen, the film (which opens with a quote from Will Duant) also advances larger questions about the natural and unnatural life cycles of civilizations."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,78,"There's so much dark material jammed into this complicated, conflicted, challenging, and charismatic man's (Gibson) own noggin that sometimes he knows not, I think, what he's done. Here, behold, Mel Gibson has made the weirdest, most violent movie of the year."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"Say what you will about Gibson, but he's a genuine filmmaker, and Apocalypto gallops along the thin line between the deluded and the inspired with such conviction that you're yanked into its wake."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"It's possible for a despicable heart and mind to make great art. And if Gibson hasn't quite done that with Apocalypto, he's nevertheless made an impressive and engrossing film. If you choose out of hand to miss it, which is your right, you'll be missing something."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but that sadomasochistic anti-Semite knows how to shoot a movie."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,70,Apocalypto exists solely as an action-adventure and a deft cinematic demonstration of man's capacity for cruelty. This is the true passion of Mel.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,63,"A lotta woe to sit through, with not much to think about and only one matter to address. After the two hours-plus have sped by with brutal alacrity, all that's left is for the survivors of the bloodbath to hose down and suss out a ""new beginning."" I'm still searching for mine, but you might have better luck."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,63,"Gibson is a primitive all right, but so were Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith, and somehow we survived their idiocies."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of Apocalypto is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director’s skill."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"Dextrous with the action-adventure elements but clumsy in its handling of the central message, Apocalypto is a strange but largely entertaining mix of action, bloodletting, chin-rubbing and arthouse trimmings."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"It's difficult to imagine the target audience for this film. Gangbangers, perhaps?"
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,58,"With ""Braveheart,"" ""Passion"" and now Apocalypto, Gibson clearly has established his priorities as a director. History is gore, plus a few hearthside family interludes. The trick is instilling the audience with enough rageful bloodlust to make the story work."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Numerous good things can be said about Apocalypto, the director's foray into the decaying Mayan civilization of the early 1500s, but every last one of them is overshadowed by Gibson's well-established penchant for depictions of stupendous amounts of violence."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"I could go on about the beautifully detailed production design, the fresh performances from unknown and often nonprofessional actors, blabbety blah. But praising the movie's craftsmanship seems less urgent than communicating the overwhelming experience of watching it: the clammy, claustrophobic dread of being trapped in a torture chamber."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Gibson sure knows how to shoot a sequence, but he also doesn't know when to stop with the blood, gore and maiming."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Yet Apocalypto has to be respected for the sheer audacity of it, for the commitment and ambition behind it, and for its presentation of a complete other world. It is the furthest thing from a cynical or casual piece of work. It's crazy, and it moves."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"But even those who succumb to his primitive, survivalist vision may resent the way he presents every kind of atrocity at least twice without illuminating any of the exotic details once."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,42,"Not just a walk in the park with Mel and the guys (in this case a large cast of mainly Mexican Indians speaking present- day Yucatec), this lavishly punishing picture is the third panel in Gibson's ""Ordeal"" triptych. The Martyrdom of the Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ have nothing on The Misadventures of the Jaguar Paw."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,40,"A relentlessly gruesome, visually impressive and ultimately not very interesting movie with some pretensions to seriousness."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,40,"The movie is so impressionistic, it obfuscates any sense of history. We expect at least a hint at the causes of the Mayan Empire's demise, but instead we get Mesoamerican Rambo."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,38,"It's ""Braveheart"" without historical significance and ""Passion"" without spirituality, though it dabbles in both, and it represents as brazen an act of career suicide as I can recall from a star director. If he were a first-timer, he'd never work again."

See No Evil,5.1,15032800,40,"The killer in this nasty yet taut slice-and-dice 'em horror flick is a collector of eyeballs, which he removes from his screaming victims with an efficient single swooping motion of his talon-like index finger. If that image makes you grin not cringe, then this movie's for you."

See No Evil,5.1,15032800,0,"It's hard to believe that the distributors of See No Evil were so afraid of what critics would say about their movie that they refused to provide advance screenings. The movie's target viewers aren't the type who read reviews, if they read at all."
See No Evil,5.1,15032800,0,"As the killer, who plucks out his victims' eyeballs, Kane, the seven-foot bald WWE wrestler who's like a modern Tor Johnson, is so inept he's more cuddly than terrifying."
See No Evil,5.1,15032800,0,"Unlike former porn auteur Gregory Dark's semenal 1985 cumshot opus ""New Wave Hookers"", this rote exercise in slasher-film tedium holds zero surprises and is about as arousing as Tracy Lords' singing career."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,80,"A pitch-black, often very funny slice of pulp fiction with a number of stand-out performances, notably the ferocious Theron."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,75,"A largely fun watch, a corporate crime tale of consistent tartness enacted by a superb cast."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,75,"With a movie like this, either you’ll tap out after 15 minutes or you’ll settle in for an evening of popcorn and beverage-of-your choice escapism."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,75,It’s an especially fun dark comedy from a director and cast who are clearly having a good time allowing themselves to let loose.
Gringo,6.1,4969853,70,"It’s the central performance by Oyelowo, who allows us to laugh at Harold’s naiveté and tomfoolery with some well-placed broad comedy choices while never dropping the ball on the character’s relatability, that makes Gringo a worthy watch for genre fans."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,70,"Gringo is a slightly above-average crime farce with a way above-average protagonist — both in terms of writing and performance, and especially given the genre. It’s a surprising high point in Oyelowo’s already distinguished career."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,67,"The movie has a floppy vibe to it, teetering on lazy farce in its mixed marriage of dry humor and flashes of violence."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,63,"It’s a twisty dark comedy in the action-suspense vein, piled high with talented actors playing cretinous fools and featuring enough betrayals, mistaken identities, and narrative switchbacks to keep you pleasurably befuddled."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,60,"A fun romp with a great comic performance from Oyelowo. Doesn’t linger, but you’ll enjoy it while it lasts."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,58,"Solid chunks of the screwball humor land like bricks, and the characters — most of them idiots, a**holes, or suckers — are colorfully over-the-top but not especially memorable."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,58,"Aussie director Nash Edgerton loads up on some of his signatures, including lots of bad guys, tons of twists, and a dark sense of humor. Unfortunately, his sensibilities are dulled by a sprawling story that never quite snaps together."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"The narrative contains some clever moments but the resolution somehow feels like a cop-out, perhaps because we’ve seen it so many times before."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"It can't decide whether it wants to be magnificently toxic or merely mediocre. Mileage may vary on where the movie eventually lands, but either way, this is a ""romp"" that's keen on going nowhere ... and sloooowly."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Watching bad people be bad gets tiring, especially when there’s someone like Oyelowo transcending the material to lend complexity and uncertainty."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"The pleasures of Gringo are the pleasures of genre: It’s a fun type of movie, but it’s not a good version of the type."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Gringo’s obvious debt to the works of Tarantino and the Coen brothers give it a tone that’s too arch and haphazard to keep the audience rooted in its characters. The movie’s sense of humor is about twenty years too old, manifesting in glib jabs at other characters’ expense for being fat, or mentally challenged, or poorly-endowed."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Director Nash Edgerton never really sinks his teeth into the delectable darkness of his hero’s nemeses, struggling to maintain the right acidic tone."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"There’s an old-school, B-movie snap to much of the proceedings, which Nash Edgerton modernizes without imposing too flashy a style upon the material. It’s pulp, plain and simple, delivering on the chance to watch depraved characters navigate unseemly situations."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"A sometimes amusing, sometimes draggy and overstuffed affair that always relies on its talent-rich cast to carry the day."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"While the fish-out-of-water caper is stuffed with whiplash turns and colorfully eccentric lowlife characters, it never adds up to much. It’s so busy you might think there’s more to it than they’re really is."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,50,"Gringo dabbles in several genres, none particularly well."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"It’s neither funny nor exciting enough to obscure what a miasma of unfocused randomness it is, even though the cast is clearly trying to make something out of all this half-baked material."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"Mr. Oyelowo is without a doubt the best thing in Gringo, supplying the only grace notes in a cacophony of secondhand attitude and facetious overacting."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"The movie achieves a take-it-or-leave-it watchability without being much to look at, and as a nominal thrill ride, it’s underpowered."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,40,"The film periodically livens up, and Oyelowo shows that he can play comedy, but his performance isn’t given much guidance or room to grow and the direction is very flat and uninspired."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,38,"Oyelowo is the one who comes off without a scratch and actually has some quite amusing moments (he has a great, high-pitched scream and solid comedic timing). If only the movie was a better showcase."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,38,"The circuitous narrative of Nash Edgerton's Gringo is such that it never allows for a character or storyline to develop in a particularly efficient way, as every few minutes an abrupt twist or turn sets things off in a new and unexpected direction."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,38,"Everything about Gringo, from the storytelling to the comedy to the cinematography is incredibly lackluster. The film is dark and dim, like everything's covered in a layer of dust. Oyelowo is quite endearing and funny as Harold, but he's given very little to work with."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,30,"This wildly uneven mix of nasty and nervy...is primarily a time-waster, trotting out clichéd misadventure tropes and predictable zigzags in a manner neither terribly funny nor suspenseful."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"Featuring a fittingly shallow funk-lite score by Christophe Beck, Gringo, is ultimately like a Taco Bell version of the ‘90s crime genre; tasteless, cheaply made and just as inauthentic."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"Gringo has no spark, no fizz. Its scenes sag like overstretched taffy. Flavorless taffy."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"Absolutely nothing about Gringo works. Well, maybe one decent car crash pays off. The performances, situations, dialogue and story beats are just flung at the screen in the vain hope that something sticks...Nothing does."
Gringo,6.1,4969853,25,"If someone somehow convinced somebody somewhere to turn the screenplay for Gringo into a real-life motion picture with real-deal actors, then, hell, it could happen to anyone."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,75,"In a summer where the special effects in movies have grown steadily more repetitive and dreary, ""LCTR:TCOL"" uses imagination and exciting locations to give the movie the same kind of pulp adventure feeling we get from the Indiana Jones movies."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,70,"Angelina Jolie focuses her wild energy into outlandish heroics, and emerges with more attractiveness and credibility than all three of those silly Charlie's Angels combined."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,63,Somewhat fleeter and more engaging than its predecessor.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,63,"Jolie is even hotter, faster and more commanding than last time around as the fearless heiress/adventuress, plus a little more human. The less welcome news is that most of the same shortcomings that cramped the first installment are still dogging the sequel, which delivers on action but dawdles through downtime."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,"However caricatured a vision of female empowerment, Lara Croft exercises an irresistible tug not just on the adolescent male imagination but the 12-year-old female imagination as well."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,"This Indiana Jones knockoff goes down smoothly enough, and Jolie isn't bad at all, though every time she opened her mouth I expected Mick Jagger to come dancing down her tongue."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,Enough goodwill has been built up in the early sections that most viewers will not take offense when the movie abandons its plot and characters.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,60,Croft is one humorless butt-kicker. Excavations in exotic lands have rarely looked so much like items on a to-do list.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,58,"Its not half bad, with cool locations and a great stunt leap from the top of a Hong Kong high-rise."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Superior to 2001's ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" in almost every way. It's better directed, more consistently acted, and its writing, while at times ridiculous, at least has a modicum of logic at its core. I still had to slap myself to stay awake."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"A creditable genre entry, the rare action movie with a discernible story, an assured pace and a charismatic central character. It falls apart in the end."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Even though the special effects and action sequences are good, the monsters conjured up are rather humdrum."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Bombastic it may be, but its rarely boring, as was the first Tomb Raider. Keep your expectations in line with the source material and you may be pleasantly surprised."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"This is a highly enjoyable summer thrill ride with an action heroine who likes to be on top, literally and figuratively."

Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"If only the love story were a little more convincing, she might have saved the world and the movie."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Isn't nearly as much fun as the original. For one thing, Lara having a boyfriend wrecks everything."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,Emerges as just one more formulaic action film as the title character bounces around the globe in a deadly treasure hunt.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Offers plenty of eye candy, if little else. Ultimately, the film is clearly superior to its predecessor, but that's mostly because the first Tomb Raider left so much room for improvement."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Its faults -- banal dialogue, ludicrous and uninspired plotting, dull but vicious fight scenes -- make you realize just how much the summer action movie has declined in the last few years."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,Simply a series of set pieces designed to insure Angelina Jolie's status as action-babe pin-up.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"The movie is all action. But there's no pacing, no suspense and no vulnerability for the protagonist so it all soon gets numbingly tiresome."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Even in the final battle over life and death, the only injury she suffers is a slight scratch on the face. Its too much like a video game."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,50,"Quite simply, the ""Tomb Raider"" series has been flat-out boring, even with the talented and fun Jolie -- who needs to take off those harnesses and get back to real movies. She deserves better."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,42,Beneath its satisfactory chops this movie -- like Ms. Croft herself -- is stuffy and soulless.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,40,"With her bulging blue eyes, elaborately braided hair and slinky spandex costumes, she's an indelible icon of action-heroine chic, and, quite frankly, the films don't deserve her."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,40,"Competent in the extreme, the talented Jolie would make a great Jane Bond. But mired in this joyless orgy of preposterousness, her biggest challenge is simply keeping a straight face."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,38,"If ever there was a movie fit for permanent entombment, it's this sequel."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,30,"In a summer of surprisingly self-serious comic book movies"" Lara Croft ""stands out as being particularly humorless."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,30,Cradle of lifelessness.
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,25,"Another joyless, brain-numbing adventure through lackluster Indiana Jones territory."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,25,"The worst action movie of the summer. I liked Bad Boys II a little less, but making the comparison is like distinguishing between a cow turd and a horse turd. And that pretty much sums it up nicely."
Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,5.5,65660196,25,It wouldn't be fair to gripe about the hundreds of plot holes; the whole thing is hole.
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,75,"Although this entry is competently directed, the series seems to have lost the zip and flashes of wit that made the first Death Wish so memorably repellent."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,40,"Slackly paced and unexciting, Death Wish V comes off as a flat-footed, by-the-numbers programmer that, judging from what’s onscreen, failed to spark much enthusiasm among the people who made it."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,30,An appropriately absurd finale for a series that long ago went over the top.
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,25,"Grecian Formula and body corsets notwithstanding, Bronson looks like one of those sculpted potato heads and moves with appropriate grace. This is not the face of death; it's the face of old."
Death Wish V: The Face of Death,4.8,1702394,25,"Even though its characters tote cellular phones and live in ultramodern high-rise apartments, the film still has a sleazy 1970's ambiance. And while Mr. Bronson goes through the motions of revenge with his characteristic deliberation, he looks puffy and sounds terminally bored."
Dune,6.6,30925690,90,"While it's hardly a cohesive experience, individual scenes are brought to life with striking power."
Dune,6.6,30925690,75,"For all its cumbersome scope (realized on a shimmeringly large scale by Lawrence of Arabia cinematographer Freddie Francis), the film remains an intensely personal epic, Lynch's uncommon emphasis on characters rather than effects lending his exposition a rather remarkable lucidity."
Dune,6.6,30925690,70,"Lynch's third feature may have been a commercial disaster, but it gets under your skin and is marked by unforgettable images and an extraordinary soundtrack."
Dune,6.6,30925690,70,A most fascinating disaster of genre making.
Dune,6.6,30925690,60,"Dune is a huge, hollow, imaginative and cold sci-fi epic. Visually unique and teeming with incident, David Lynch's film holds the interest due to its abundant surface attractions but won't, of its own accord, create the sort of fanaticism which has made Frank Herbert's 1965 novel one of the all-time favorites in its genre."
Dune,6.6,30925690,60,"DUNE is visually delightful but choppy, confusing, and overloaded with exposition. Moreover, most of the thematic material that made the novel work--subtexts involving incestuous desire, capitalism vs. environmentalism, and Middle East politics--is simply missing."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"How maddening Dune is! As you would expect from visionary director David Lynch, it is a movie of often staggering visual power, the most ambitious science fiction film since ""2001""; it's also stupefyingly dull and disorderly. Dune doesn't get going till fully two hours have elapsed, so only the most patient will wait for the images to build to their crescendo. Lax in its storytelling, Dune gives us sublimity unmoored."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"The problem is that the imagery—as Sadean as Pasolini's Salo—isn't rooted in any story impulse, and so its power dissipates quickly. The real venue for this film is either a grind house or the Whitney Museum."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"So inward and remote does the movie seem, it might have arrived in a time capsule from one of the four warring planets. Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it."
Dune,6.6,30925690,40,"SEVERAL of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie."
Dune,6.6,30925690,40,"This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,100,"This is one perfectly terrifying movie, an instant classic."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,89,"Nearly a perfect film, from its bold and epic man-vs.-nature conflict to the breathless scripting, editing, acting, and direction."

The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,80,"As a movie, this is exciting stuff."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,80,Scary and exciting.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"Dive right in if you're looking for an old-fashioned entertainment that delivers corny romance, turbulent action, and enough wave-churning seascapes to make ""Titanic"" seem landlocked."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"The problem with The Perfect Storm is that while its roiling collision of weather systems is pulled off with cinematic deftness, the actors who stand there getting lashed and splashed don't have anything terribly interesting to say."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"Does about as good a job of simulating that terror as it possibly could, but it's no competition for what we create in our mind's eye while reading."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,Unabashedly designed to blow its audience away.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,Petersen's speculative reenactment makes for gripping summer entertainment -- if you don't mind a little corn floating in your brine.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,70,"Impersonal Hollywood filmmaking at its most paradoxical. It keeps you glued to your seat, and leaves no aftertaste whatsoever."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,70,"Has noticeable problems with characterization and dialogue. But once that awesome storm, one of the most terrifying ever put on film, gets cranked up, it's hard to remember what those difficulties were, let alone care too much about them."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,67,"The stick-figure people in the script haven't the slightest chance of making an impression, and you're more excited at the prospect of the next big wave?"
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,65,"The perfect example, of how the newest visual effects movies have the capacity to overwhelm everything--from actors to plotlines--except in the end, maybe, their audiences."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,"By the end, I felt like a beetle going round and round in a toilet bowl that just wouldn't stop flushing."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,So much water. Such a dramatic washout.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,"The movie is ""Twister"" on the high seas, a spectacular-looking, spectacularly hollow tale about foolhardy men vs. imperious nature."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,An enthralling special-effects tour de force with a lover's nook.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,60,The storm is the reason to see the movie.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,60,"Overall, the book is a far more rewarding experience than the movie."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,58,"Petersen gives us monumental images of waves and rain and wind, but the editing is so choppy that the images don't build and crest."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"But jaw-dropping trailer aside, there isn't much movie here."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,Rains on its own parade.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"Not terrible, but distinctly disappointing, not nearly as engaging or thrilling as its premise seems to promise."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"The Perfect Storm is no ""Titanic."""
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"The yarn's emotional undercurrents never take hold, resulting in a picture that leaves one thinking less about the fates of the characters than about how the actors had to spend most of their working days soaking wet."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"What's true about The Perfect Storm is true of many effects epics: it's not a bad movie, except for the people."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,Big effects; threadbare story.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"Once at sea, The Perfect Storm collapses in a heap of spectacle and a dubious piling-on of scary incidents."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"The whole thing is kitsch of the most pricey sort, and it's a good guess that it will be a smash."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"It may have been the perfect storm, but this is the imperfect movie."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"Its spectacular special effects threaten to swallow characters whole, and there are times when overwrought and clumsy dialogue... nearly pitch you right out of the movie's mood."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,It's like a memorial service with killer special effects.
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,90,"Even when Conspiracy Theory is jammed or rushed or overly jittery, Gibson's command--of Jerry's fractured psyche, his freak perceptions, and his ardor--gives the picture blue-eyed soul."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,75,"The good guys metamorphose into bad guys and back into good guys with dazzling efficiency in Brian Helgeland's disturbing, comic script."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,75,"Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts contribute major star power to the uneven tale, but it never becomes as convincing as a real conspiracy theory should."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,70,"With it's many knotty connections and complex exposition, the movie is definitely something of a muddle, but for that matter so are most conspiracy theories."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,67,"You're set up for when director Richard Donner -- who worked with Gibson on all three audience-pleasing Weapons -- switches the movie from a really interesting, jittery, literate, and witty tone poem about justified contemporary paranoia (and the creatively unhinged dark side of New York City) to an overloaded, meandering iteration of a Lethal Weapon project that bears the not-so-secret stamp of audience testing and tinkering."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,63,"Unfortunately, the parts of the movie that are truly good are buried beneath the deadening layers of thriller cliches and an unconvincing love story."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,60,"Though it tries to be different, with hair's-breadth escapes that don't depend on implausible stunts or Bondian-scale explosions, Conspiracy Theory is an uneasy mix of laughs and thrills; suspense and soap."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"With a plot that thickens like congealed stew, this movie about a harmless nutbar, an attorney and a cabal can leave you lost in banality."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Taking its cue from the notion that American society is obsessed with covert political intrigues and machinations, Conspiracy Theory is an interesting but flawed thriller in which the wildly paranoiac is something really real."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"The only sneaky scheme at work here is the one that inflates a hollow plot to fill 2 1/4 hours while banishing skepticism with endless close-ups of big, beautiful movie-star eyes."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"In the end, Conspiracy Theory fails to work as an action film, a romance, or a mystery -- all of which it aspires to be."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Instead of a scalding brew of mirth and malice, served black, Donner settles up a tepid latte, decaf."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Conspiracy Theory doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy, a political thriller, a romance or a satire."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,It's just a simple thriller whose goal is little more than to keep moving.
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"The film isn't really about much and so feels patchy and forced, with elements more calculated than inspired, more urgent than exciting."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Roberts and Gibson form a ""pas de deux,"" two lonely urbanites fighting vague yet common enemies in a plot that never quite comes together."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"Not a terrible movie exactly, just a dark, edgy idea relentlessly worn down into mildly diverting blandness by the mega-wattage presence of stars Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,50,"A below-par star vehicle for Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, Conspiracy Theory is a sporadically amusing but listless thriller that wears its humorous, romantic and political components like mismatched articles of clothing."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,40,"It is one of those soap bubbles of a film, fleeting, ephemeral, seemingly there when it is not. As you leave the theater, it diminishes with each step, collapsing into shards of imagery and sensations of movement. It's the film that never was."
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,30,The story--written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Richard Donner--was just dumb.
Conspiracy Theory,6.7,75982834,30,"It might even have made a good film, but it hasn't. In the hands of stars in denial about their stardom and a director who can't be bothered to take things seriously, it has come out implausible and unsatisfying, a comic thriller that is not especially funny or thrilling."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,58,"Maybe that call will be answered next time with enough incremental improvements to finally notch a good Divergent movie, a possibility Allegiant raises repeatedly and frustratingly. Ultimately, though, this movie isn’t just adhering to a formula; it’s carefully following a recipe designed to offset any good ingredients that get mixed in there by mistake."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,56,"“Allegiant” ends up feeling like a mid-season climax to serialized TV drama. The pieces are in play, the wheels in motion. Stay tuned, loyal viewers, and you’ll get your answers next year."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"The special effects are among the more positive aspects of “Allegiant,” but those alone cannot rescue this highly flawed sequel."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,Allegiant tries to cram too little story into too much time. This results in dead spots and uneven pacing.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Director Robert Schwentke and his writing team do their best to move things along.
Actually, who knows if it's their best? Maybe they're suffering from Divergent fatigue along with the rest of us."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Allegiant aches to be a thought-provoking, moving allegory of the current world. Instead, it’s an unwieldy two hours too unintentionally silly to validate how seriously it takes itself."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Because the series' plot reveal turns out to be more confusing than compelling, and because turning a novel into two films invariably leads to inflated productions, only the most devoted fans of the book will pledge allegiance to what's on the screen."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Combines the usual dumb ideas with one good one. And not just good, but impressive, in that it makes sense of much of what went before."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"This doesn’t even feel much like Tris’s story anymore, just generically overdigitized combat. The main thing she’s diverging from at this point is the tone that hooked us in the first place."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"The film moves jerkily, in fits and starts, squandering its promising setup and bogging down in explanation."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Let's just call ""Allegiant"" what it is: A way for the studio to make money and bring you back next year for the real finale. See you then. Maybe."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,The only thing that's revolting is how dull the series has gotten.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"This over-extended teen dystopia is treading water, coming up short on its trademark punchy plotting, teen self-discovery and the wonderful Woodley."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Big but boring, expansive but cheap-looking, Allegiant spins in place, waiting for next year’s Ascendent to come along and offer resolution. In all candour: you can do without it."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Like the earlier Divergent films, Allegiant is studded with enticing science-fiction ideas, but it keeps such a poker-straight face while presenting them, you often can’t help but crack up."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Instead of bringing much-needed clarity, Allegiant piles on yet more bamboozling mythology to flummox and confound."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Long, shiny, and treading a lot of water."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"It all leads to a climax so staggeringly lazy and glib that you honestly expect Woodley just to turn to the camera in the final scene, shrug her shoulders and walk off."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"For a film that takes great pride in its heroine's nonconformism, pretty much everything in Allegiant feels conventional."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Although “Allegiant” does recapture the original film’s sense of constantly discovering and adapting to fresh information, audiences no longer identify with anyone in particular."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"As tedious as much of this sounds, an odd thing happened around “Allegiant’s” midway point. The fairly packed audience started vocally reacting “Rocky Horror”-style to some of the more overtly melodramatic turns with “oohs,"" “ahhs” and even laughter."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"All of it feels warmed over, reprocessed … and, yes, confused."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"It's a pretty dull picture, I must say, because it's my duty to say it. And it's a pretty dull picture, I must say, because something about its particular grade of dullness may cause memory loss."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,37,Everything is needlessly tangled and bewildering.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,33,"Above all of the tiresome, poorly constructed mythology, nonexistent stakes, and presentation of subtext as text, Allegiant’s greatest sin is its total contempt for its viewers."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,"Three films into the ongoing Divergent series, one would hope we’d moved beyond laying plates and folding napkins to get to something more substantial. Yet Allegiant barely makes it to the appetizer course."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,"The actors still give it their all in Allegiant, but there's only so much they can do with such a clunky, verbose script. And on the rare occasion that the film actually quiets its characters down and delivers something resembling action, it's woefully inert."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,A story that kicked off two years ago at a reasonable gallop has now slowed to barely a limp.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"If only their stuff had a spark of life it might be forgivable, but Allegiant plods along like a franchise on its last legs. Who remembers where we left off last time in Insurgent? My point exactly — no one."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"Try as I might, I cannnot activate your interest in this bloated excuse for a movie."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"The pleasures of Allegiant are unintended, those little bits of business taken so seriously that serious viewers must laugh."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"This sort of movie really should be about more than meekly obvious names for human traits separated into tribes, the future tech, the dystopian landscape, the fashions, the hair styles...But there isn’t a line that lands, a scene that sticks with you, an emotion you feel or a moment this movie drags you to the edge of your seat."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,0,"By the time David gets someone to unleash the gas, I was wishing he could simply erase all memories of the sorry “Divergent’’ franchise."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,100,"The Grandmaster is, at its most persuasive, about the triumph of style. When Ip Man slyly asks “What’s your style?” it’s clear that Mr. Wong is asking the same question because here, as in his other films, style isn’t reducible to ravishing surfaces; it’s an expression of meaning."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,90,"In short, I'd be the happiest person in the world if Wong announced there was a four-hour cut of this film somewhere. For now, neither version is perfect, but they’re both so beautiful, so heartbreaking, that the question may be moot. Whatever its flaws, seeing The Grandmaster theatrically, in any version, should be a sacrament for any true film lover — a spiritual duty."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,90,"An exercise in pure cinematic style filled with the most ravishing images, The Grandmaster finds director Wong Kar-wai applying his impeccable visual style to the mass-market martial arts genre with potent results."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,90,"The Grandmaster, may well be the definitive illustration of kung fu in all its arcane schools and intricate styles. There's never been anything like it — a seemingly endless flow of spectacular images in a story about Ip Man (Tony Leung), the legendary kung-fu master who trained Bruce Lee."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,88,"The Grandmaster sets aside traditional story structure in its last 15 minutes and becomes one of the filmmaker’s free-form visual poems, suffused with melancholy and compassion."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,83,"Intermittently action-packed and lethargic, the movie dances around formula. By delivering an expressionistic character study with bursts of intensity unlike anything else in his oeuvre and yet stylistically representative of its entirety, Wong practically has it both ways."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"Flawed but often flooring, The Grandmaster swoons with grace, feeling and elegance. With Leung and Zhang on killer form, Wong has delivered his best film in a decade."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,It's a film that prompts an overwhelming emotional response as it weaves its dark magic.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"It may not be much more than six of the most imaginatively staged and filmed fight scenes in the cinema, but that’s almost certainly enough to recommend it."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"It’s certainly not Wong’s greatest work; it may be a masterpiece that evades the mass audience or a beautiful failure with moments of greatness. All I know is that I got lost in it, and that I would still have loved it if it were twice as long with half the action."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"This is a story told in shards; Wong is so obsessed with visual details – faces refracted as if in a broken mirror, or fragile arcs of blood being traced out on the pavement by the feet of two feuding kung fu masters – that the story he’s trying to tell is partly obscured by them."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"True to Wong’s style, The Grandmaster is infused with melancholy and a near-existentialist resignation to the uncertainties of fate."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,80,"Venturing into fresh creative terrain without relinquishing his familiar themes and stylistic flourishes, Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar Wai exceeds expectations with The Grandmaster, fashioning a 1930s action saga into a refined piece of commercial filmmaking."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"The director took great efforts to be true to Chinese martial arts, but he did so without sacrificing his own distinctive vision."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"What's on screen in The Grandmaster is off-puttingly disjointed, but it's also dazzling in its startling action and ravishing romance."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Who knows what they’re fighting about, but given the ecstatic ballet of fists and water, tossed bodies and smashed decor, centered by Leung’s majestic impassivity, it doesn’t really matter."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,The elegant style of the fighting sequences does more than display camera and kung fu technique — this style also shows fighters living with honor.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Whereas many kung-fu movies are a feast that leaves us weary with sensations, the tastefully bittersweet “Grandmaster” puts us in the mood for more."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Tony Leung plays Ip Man, the real-life kung fu innovator who most famously trained Bruce Lee. His life takes in the upheavals in China from the 1930s through the ’50s, including the Japanese occupation."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"The Grandmaster is a drunken love letter to experience, which helps us survive, and wisdom, which helps us face aging, loss and, ultimately, the abyss. Wong, who was called the coolest director in the world when he was much younger, is now 57. This film is about a man like him, who has proven himself in the world and enters mid-life exuding a new, sage kind of cool."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"Wong extracts magnetic performances from his two stars, and Philippe Le Sourd delivers gorgeous cinematography."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,75,"An historical opus that is equal parts ballet and biography, though the second component pales in comparison with the first."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,70,"The U.S. cut, which Wong endorses, runs a slim 108 minutes, and has by all accounts been reshaped for American audiences, who, by and large, don’t have the same foreknowledge of Ip Man, or martial arts, as Asian audiences do."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,67,"At the end of the day, the pesky imperative to convey information is still a driving force; more than anything Wong has ever made, the movie chokes on exposition, its more poetic concerns stifled by its surfeit of plot."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,67,All of Wong's undeniable visual flair can't conceal the haphazard nature of the story.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,67,"There are sequences in Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai’s new film, The Grandmaster, that are as gorgeous as anything you’ll see on a screen this year, or perhaps this decade."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,The Grandmaster offers welcome relief from a moviegoing summer spent in sensory overload.
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,"A regal, majestic and downright arty take on this teacher, champion and philosopher whose life spanned much of the twentieth century."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,"The film, more likely to invite comparisons to the writings of Marcel Proust than the previous Ip Man films, is a gorgeous folly that never entirely emerges from its creator's head."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,63,"Wong’s visual grandeur is, as ever, all-encompassing."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,60,"Wong’s usual concerns overwhelm the film, and though his pairing of fisticuffs and longing is sometimes awkward, he surrounds the awkwardness with some of the most beautiful images in his career. In Wong’s world, beauty goes a long way."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,60,"The Grandmaster, five years in the making, feels like a waste of Wong’s talents."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,60,"Tony Leung plays Ip Man with his old-movie charisma and reserve, but the film, despite a few splendid fights, is a biohistorical muddle that never finds its center. Maybe that's because — big mistake! — it never gets to Bruce Lee."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,58,"The film is beautiful but troubled, achieving in stretches the director's signature dreamy mood but dragged down by narrative confusions."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,50,"The movie ultimately winds up falling between two stools, failing as both a biography and an action film. Martial arts fans will naturally be drawn to the story, but the film does nothing to open up the world to outsiders."
Ildae jongsa,6.6,6594959,40,"The end result feels like only half a movie. That half -- the technical half, with Wong's stylistic flourishes and the film's lush technical elements -- is a heck of a film. The rest of The Grandmaster, however -- the storytelling -- is anything but grand."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,88,"Any movie with the sense, the wit and the visual instincts to introduce Kong the way this one does is fine with me."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,83,"Kong: Skull Island is an offering to the hungry mouths at the multiplex who want to cheer a movie that doesn't insult, or tax, their intelligence."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,83,"It also cannot be overstated what an asset [John C.] Reilly is. The moment he shows up, the movie feels enlivened and energized; his mere presence adds a tremendous amount of oddball charm and humor."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"The picture is grand and nutty and visually splendid: Vogt-Roberts knows he's gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"The new Kong: Skull Island really gets it right — the exotic adventure, the spectacular special effects, the towering terrors. It’s a big hunk of nostalgic fun, reminding us of the 1933 original even as it monkeys around with the classic story."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,The surprise is that “Skull Island” isn’t just ten times as good as “Jurassic World”; it’s a rousing and smartly crafted primordial-beastie spectacular.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"A large part of the enjoyment comes down to the sheer earth-shaking lunacy of Kong’s daily grind, even before the human intruders are factored in."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"This highly entertaining return of one of the cinema's most enduring giant beasts moves like crazy — the film feels more like 90 minutes than two hours — and achieves an ideal balance between wild action, throwaway humor, genre refreshment and, perhaps most impressively, a nonchalant awareness of its own modest importance in the bigger scheme of things."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"Kong: Skull Island is a grand cinematic adventure powered by furry fury, as the horrors of war blend with chest-beating creature confidence."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,The action and special effects are mostly first-rate and Vogt-Roberts maintains a vaguely satiric tone that sidesteps schlockiness.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"It is the platonic ideal of big, smart-dumb B-movie filmmaking – and, like Kong himself, it must be seen to be believed."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"If Reilly’s presence gives Kong: Skull Island its playful, gonzo edge, it’s the title character himself who gives it soul, morphing from a monster into a brooding symbol of the colossal folly of military belligerence and hegemonic hubris."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"If you’re looking for a film that offers pure escapism, Kong: Skull Island should definitely meet expectations."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"In this digital world that allows for Kong to be as big as a building and believably so, Roberts is smart to pull out all the stops. And if some of the story and character motivation gets left in the dust, so be it."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island is fast, playful and ridiculous, a big-budget extravaganza with the soul of a spirited B-movie."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island isn’t a remake or a reboot or a re-anything. It’s just a Saturday matinee creature feature with a smart, unpretentious script, a handful of solid supporting players, and a digital Kong who feels big enough and real enough to provoke the necessary awe. This is all to the movie’s credit."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"The monsters are brilliantly designed and skillfully animated (except for a few shots where Kong looks a tad cartoony), and the army of visual and sound effects artists convince you that that these CGI titans live and breathe and weigh hundreds of tons."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,It’s wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island is a smart SciFi action movie that doesn’t rely on a handful of monsters and random scenes of computerized destruction to run out the clock. It has a smart script, imaginative filmmaking and a cast of fine actors that actually get to act."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"The dialogue is clunky, the A-list actors are slumming and, yeah, you've seen it all before. But Kong: Skull Island is a creature feature that's damn near irresistible."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,Skull Island has a lot of globe-trotting fun assembling its team of expendables.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Perhaps the most satisfying thing about the film is what comes after, when you stop to realize how darkly comic and sickly fun the film was after you’re done reeling from all the impaling and dismemberment."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,70,"In the struggle between sober subtext and monster-movie goofiness, the goofiness mostly wins out."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,67,"Hiddleston and Larson are especially let down by the script, which wants to be jokey in the way that something like Predator was, but can’t pull it off. The same lack of care goes into the period-specific song choices that have as much imagination as a Time-Life Songs of the ‘70s set."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,65,"It lacks neither fun nor polish, but it has the square tidiness of a compartmentalized fast-food meal."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,"As a big-budget B-grade monster movie, Kong: Skull Island is a home run. It offers all the tropes and clichés one expects from this sort of endeavor, sparing no expense when it comes to special effects. As a King Kong movie, however, Skull Island is less successful."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,"Kong: Skull Island won’t win any points for the brilliance of its writing (or for the way it reduces a terrific actor like Larson to a personality-free camera-clicker) — but oh, that ape"
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,It’s when there's a distinct lack of King Kong that Skull Island turns into a plodding affair.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"Story and soul are never going to be kings on Skull Island, but they could have fared better than this."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"“Skull Island” has momentum, polish and behemoths that slither and thunder. The sets and creature designs are often beautifully filigreed, but the larger picture remains murky."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"It's a heck of a cast, although the hands-down scene-stealer is John C. Reilly, in a gem of a comic-relief role that, in the interest of remaining spoiler-free, is probably best undescribed here."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"Kong: Skull Island is one of those movies best described as big, dumb fun."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,Derivative and a little dumb but consistently fun: there’s personality and panache to spare in this monster blockbuster.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"If the film belongs to anyone, it’s creature designer Carlos Huante. Kong is expressive and impressive, both in hair and full-body movement, and his interaction – with water, humans, other animals – is consistently fluid."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,King Kong lives! But only just. This is an uneven adventure that’s saved by the spectacle of its towering title character and the various beasts with whom he shares his island home.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"For all its updated bluster, this update still can’t escape the shadow of 1933’s magical King Kong."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"This is a creature feature, plain and simple — and, at least on a visceral level, a satisfying one."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,58,"Kong: Skull Island strips the beauty from a legendary beast, reducing a classic movie star to soulless monster mechanics. Kong smashes, but not much else. Whoever dies doesn't matter. Whoever lives has a sequel promised by the end credits."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,58,"Kong: Skull Island may include some clever period details and idiosyncratic asides, but it’s largely a blockbuster B-movie less interested in depth than scale."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"Where Hiddleston seems perfectly at home in the digital trenches, gamely swinging at fiendish foes to be added in postproduction, Larson looks like she’s staring into thin air. That leaves us with the monsters, who are, to be fair, mightily impressive."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"On the whole, though, Kong: Skull Island is great big dumb fun. It’s also shockingly beautiful to look at when you aren’t having creature guts flung into the camera."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,Vogt-Roberts never develops the characters enough to make us care whether anyone lives or dies and never whips up even a flirtation between Hiddleston and Larson.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"It’s “Avatar” simplistic, glib and dumb and not nearly as funny as they seem to think it is."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"The thing that breaks the back of this movie, and makes the second half so much less prodigious than the first, is a simple matter of geography. Once the combatants are split up and scattered around the island (Packard here, Chapman there, Conrad and Marlow stuck in their own heart of darkness), the story loses focus and even starts to drag."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,Its combination of lavishness and lack of imagination is the only thing memorable about it.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,"I’ve gone on about the creatures because there’s so little to say about the humans, who, in their turn, have little to say about the creatures, because the writers haven’t written enough lively dialogue."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,"Caution should always be taken when branding any film about an 80-foot ape ""illogical"", but such is the gross stupidity of the film's movable feast - and the abominable dialogue spewing from their mouths - that you'll likely thank the primate deity himself every time one is crushed, impaled or bisected."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,25,Every creature here that's intended to burrow themselves into the audience’s nightmares are less wonders of imagination than of size.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,20,"This fantastically muddled and exasperatingly dull quasi-update of the King Kong story looks like a zestless mashup of Jurassic Park, Apocalypse Now and a few exotic visual borrowings from Miss Saigon. It gets nowhere near the elemental power of the original King Kong or indeed Peter Jackson’s game remake; it’s something Ed Wood Jr might have made with a trillion dollars to do what he liked if he’d been given a trillion dollars – but minus the fun."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,100,"Bold and stirring with impeccable production values, The Last of the Mohicans is a memorable motion picture adventure, and one of the best films of the year."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,100,"The first hour of The Last of the Mohicans plays like a convoluted history lesson. I appreciate that Mann has enough respect for the audience's intelligence to sketch in this briar patch of conflicting loyalties. But he outlines the interlocking factions without really making it clear, in dramatic terms, what each one stands for."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,90,"When this historical adventure kicks in, it's thrilling in the way old-fashioned epics used to be, but its romanticism has a fierce, violent physicality that gives it a distinctively modern stamp."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,88,[The Last of the Mohicans] blends pure adventure with a compelling central romance.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,83,"The Last of the Mohicans is a striking mixture of the ersatz and the genuine. In other words, it’s vintage Hollywood. It’s also a smashingly entertaining and satisfying adventure."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"Mann, who's best known for such urban crime dramas as ""Vice"" and ""Manhunter,"" is equally at home whether the chase concerns a cigarette boat or a birch-bark canoe. He brings the same flair pairing action and style to The Last of the Mohicans, an attempt to resurrect and redefine the American hero."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans isn't a classic, but it's one of the most exciting action pictures to come along in recent memory."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans rarely flinches in depicting the eye-for-an-eye savagery of war. Although not explicit in the way you might expect, it nevertheless requires you to screw your courage to the sticking place. Perhaps that's a tribute to its ability to take you along its journey without much effort – real enough to elicit a visceral reaction, romantic enough to remind you it's only a movie."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,The Last of the Mohicans is not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be -- more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit -- but it is probably more entertaining as a result.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"Drawing upon the novel with merciful selectivity, and adding such a contemporary flavor that the film's woodsmen often have a laid-back air, Michael Mann has directed a sultrier and more pointedly responsible version of this story."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans comes at you like a tomahawk. Hard, fast and brutal, it slashes at your throat and just about leaves you for dead. Undeniably exciting as this definitely is, however, its impact comes at the expense of some of the gentler virtues, qualities that even top-drawer barn-burners really shouldn't ignore."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,88,"A blast, the best action movie of the summer."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,83,"When Bekmambetov is in full stride and the gore, oaths and silver bullets are flying, it's a kick.  The title may sound like a joke, but Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is serious fun."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,78,"Benjamin Walker, as Lincoln, may not have the gangly gravitas of Raymond Massey's ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" – he looks like a young Liam Neeson doing a younger Bruce Campbell, frankly – but he does have a sly, self-effacing sense of humor that feels ever so Lincoln-esque"
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,75,"Instead of getting smirky and campy and blowing out the joke in the first few scenes, Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov straight-face it. They ask themselves, well, what would it be like if the main struggle of Lincoln's life were with vampires intent on taking over the new world? And they answer the question as realistically and soberly as they can within this loony framework."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,75,"Without a doubt the best film we are ever likely to see on the subject - unless there is a sequel, which is unlikely, because at the end, the Lincolns are on their way to the theater."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,"There's definitely some empty-calories, summer-movie fun to be found in this ludicrous genre mashup, most of it courtesy of maniacal Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, who stages hilarious, imaginative, almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,"Genre enthusiasts will lap up the mixture of action and fantasy, while history buffs who don't mind a bit of rewriting will dig into an alternative spin on the Civil War period."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,A Civil War-era actioner of questionable taste and historical accuracy but surprisingly consistent entertainment value.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,"A stylish slasher of a movie, a monster flick that does its vampires right, if not their real-life counterparts."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,Both terribly silly and a lot of fun.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,"One expects a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter to be rich in wit and black humor, but writer Seth Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov opt to play things reasonably straight."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,The script leaps forward with an absurdity almost as great as Lincoln's own strength.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,60,"Bekmambetov directs with gusto, and the forthright absurdity of the story, combined with its weirdly heartfelt self-belief is winning."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,58,"With so much flesh crunching and bloodletting, it could have been scary as all Walking Dead get-out. Instead, the movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle - a swing that's effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls, but dull when applied to filmmaking."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,50,It's not nearly as snappy or campy as it should be-though its self-seriousness is its own kind of entertainment.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,50,"It sounds fun. It's a little fun. For a while. But Bekmanbetov shoots every killing spree like an addled gamer, working that slow-down-speed-up kill-shot cliche like a maniac."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,42,"The training montage where Lincoln learns to twirl his axe around his body like a baton for no apparent purpose is neither the movie's first laughable sequence nor its last, but it sums up the movie's aesthetic: The filmmakers mistakenly think nothing is silly if it's done with a grim enough facial expression."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"It doesn't take long for Bekmambetov to wear out his welcome with a laundry list of generic-looking action sequences: When you've seen one vampire get stabbed in the eyeball, you've seen 'em all."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Unfortunately, there's also a certain artificiality to the whole film, both visually and narratively."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is such a smashing title it's too bad someone had to spoil things by making a movie to go with it.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Given the subject matter, an exercise in delicacy and restraint was unlikely, but it's too bad that the film's concept is way more entertaining than what has ended up on-screen."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"The grave tone makes it stiff and leaden, the digi-saturated look is a turn-off. Damnable and disordered."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"The problem with movies based on a single joke is that a single joke is rarely funny enough to sustain the running time of a feature-length film. And with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the whole joke is in the title."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Watching this is like flipping channels randomly between a Masterpiece Theatre drama and a splatter film on Cinemax. If you're like me, you'll stick with the splatter."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Possible resulting ""fun"" is only slightly mitigated by contemplation of the wearisome decadence of American popular culture."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"What [Bekmambetov] doesn't do is offer us any respite from his 3D CGI barrage, an assault on the senses that makes the bullet John Wilkes Booth fired into the real Abe's noggin seem calming by comparison."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,38,"The biggest high comes from the images evoked by the title alone, or the title in tandem with the movie poster, doesn't it?"
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,38,The movie deserves a stake through the heart.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,"A pox upon history and an insult to the 16th president of the United States. It's that, of course - actually, that's the point - but this joyless, deafening cinematic headache commits a different crime. It's a sin against entertainment."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,"Other than its campy title, not much about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is fun."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,Enormous in its scope and colossal in its stupidity.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"What I don't understand is why this extended piece of idiocy chose to sink its stinky teeth into our 16th president. If an axe-wielding hero was required, George Washington would have been the better choice, with the Redcoats as bloodsuckers."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"This ludicrous CGI extravaganza, based on the comic horror novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, can stand proudly beside the best-worst of Ed Wood and Uwe Boll."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"This insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously, which is truly deadly."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,0,"I didn't know whether to be more offended as a moviegoer or as an American, but I do know I'd rather gargle nitroglycerine than watch this again, though given that the film looks like it were buried under a log cabin for a century, I barely saw it the first time."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,90,A pretty damn good summer movie.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"The script doesn't do a great job with either the spiritual or the physical trek, but the spectacular action sequences occur with enough regularity that strong writing isn't necessary to keep Waterworld afloat."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,Costner's surfer-bum affectlessness works here; he turns the Mariner into the world's most jaded lifeguard.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"A two hour aquatic pursuit pic with bruising stunts, fun-to-watch performances, a dozen good chortles and imposing Panavision renderings of post-apocalyptic crud, Waterworld clearly has the makings of a cult movie."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"If the story seems a little waterlogged, it's still big, loud, and fun to watch."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,70,"Nowhere near the Hollywood disaster that was foretold, Waterworld is a near-model summer fantasy: two hours and 21 minutes of loud, expansive fun."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,67,"A decent futuristic action picture with some great sets, some intriguing ideas, and a few images that will stay with me."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,63,"A not-bad futuristic actioner with three or four astounding sequences, an unusual hero, a nifty villain and less mythic and romantic resonance than might be desired."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,60,"Waterworld isn't ""Fishtar,"" but Kevin Costner's pricey, post-apocalyptic sloshbuckler isn't a seafaring classic either."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,"Its mediocrity guarantees this lavish, soggy retread of futuristic Australian action classic ""The Road Warrior"" a place in the ranks of forgotten extravaganzas."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,It's really not bad... It's a genuine vault at greatness that misses the mark -- but survives.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,Sublimely ridiculous.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,At least Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with wildness and wit. Costner's stolid hero seems a washout by comparison.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,"Though Waterworld has some haunting underwater visual moments, the film's impact is weakened by flat dialogue, an overemphasis on jokeyness and a plot that, despite all those screenwriters, does not satisfactorily hold together at any number of points."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,This movie feels like it was made by a bank rather than a person.
Timecop,5.9,44853581,75,"The desire to go back in time to change things -- or just to visit -- is so central to the experience of being alive and stuck in time that Timecop has a built-in power. It's a power the film, a satisfying science-fiction thriller, takes full advantage of."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,63,"Van Damme once again bends and twists his muscular frame to superhuman excess, but his Belgian tonsils have all the flexibility of the Himalayas when it comes to splurting out his one-liners."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,63,"Years of tireless persistence have begun to work in Mr. Van Damme's favor. It's hard not to enjoy his energy, even if his acting gifts still leave a lot to be desired. The fact is that he looks good, behaves affably and kicks with gusto, which is quite enough to satisfy the demands of Timecop."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,60,"Timecop, a low-rent ""Terminator,"" is the kind of movie that is best not thought about at all, for that way madness lies."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,60,"Van Damme is compelling only when he takes his clothes off, which he doesn't do often enough here."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"The plot is more confusing than clever, and the only actor who seems to be having any fun is Silver, who's at his best throwing masochistic hissy fits at his younger, not-quite-so-evil self."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"As a shoot-'em-up, blast-'em-to-pieces film, it's not half bad. As a futuristic time travel movie, however, it has some very serious problems."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"Timecop is good dumb fun, but it's likely to receive the same sentence most Van Damme projects do: a few weeks in movie theaters and eternity on video store shelves and cable television."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"Initially an amiable sci-fi thriller that toys with the paradoxes inherent in time travel, it finally gets drunk on them. It becomes an incomprehensible stew of versions and revisions, until there's no there there and no then then."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"Even though this is supposed to be a kindlier Van Damme vehicle, his movies couldn't exist without his trademark ability to deliver the kind of accurate, powerful kicks any World Cup team would envy. All his soulful glances notwithstanding, Timecop still depends too much on violence to make it appealing to the uninitiated or the unwary."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"It's dumb, to be sure, but then again, so were most of the old movie cliffhangers, from which Timecop is obviously derived."
Timecop,5.9,44853581,50,"For the most part, Hyams’ lackluster direction and the repetitive quality of the action sequences squander an intriguing premise and impressive production design, leaving few moments that elicit the sort of “Wow!” response such fare needs in order to prosper."
Born American,4.3,3388020,75,"The movie is Rambo crossed with Fraternity Vacation and a bad cartoon version of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. It's an amazingly senseless movie, done with blood-curdling confidence. Each jaw-dropping howler is staged with such rattling intensity and perfect, seamless idiocy that it becomes weirdly amusing."
Born American,4.3,3388020,30,"Comprised of so many derivative bits and pieces that it's not surprising the movie has too little narrative coherence or momentum to keep us going, and no characters we care about enough to root for."
Born American,4.3,3388020,30,"The strange thing about this film is that there are some interesting--albeit half-baked--ideas floating around in the script, and the direction shows some skill and style. However, the plot is ludicrous from start to finish, the characters one-dimensional, and the world-view simplistic."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,75,"What I regret is that all of the expertise lavished on this movie couldn't have been put at the service of a more intelligent story about real firemen, real working conditions, real heroism, and the real craft and art of fire-fighting."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,75,"Fire, as this movie makes clear, is nothing if not photogenic, and Howard has done a beautiful job of conjuring both its danger and its deceptive, primal beauty."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,60,"Not only do the firefighting scenes evoke a feeling of gritty authenticity, but the fire itself really does seem to be alive."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,60,"Visually, [the film] often is exhilarating, but it's shapeless and dragged down by corny, melodramatic characters and situations."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,50,"While Mr. Howard ably maintains a strong forward momentum, Backdraft often feels directionless beneath its overlay of frantic activity. One clear story line would have been worth more than a series of subplots and tangents."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,50,Absolutely marvelous special effects are the salvation and the curse of this movie.
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,40,"Howard, as usual, seems bent on mixing genres to make several movies at once--monster movie, crime movie, coming-of-age movie, and action-adventure movie (among others)--yielding an overall narrative that's not boring but not especially suspenseful or focused either."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,40,"Gregory Widen's script is like a Mad parody played straight, full of ""Scenes We Wouldn't Like to See."""
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,30,"Director Howard is so mesmerized by the flames, he squirts formulaic lighter fluid over everything. A conflagration of hyped-up movie cliches, courtesy of George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic special effects shop, scalds your face."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,30,"The flames sure look real, but everything else in Backdraft, director Ron Howard's inflatable ode to firefighters, seems about as genuine as a plastic log in an electric hearth. Howard's particular type of schmaltz works well enough in small dabs on comic canvases (Splash, Cocoon, even Parenthood), but pumped up to heroic proportions, the sentimentality is just plain silly - in this case, cheap melodrama on a two-hour jag."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,25,"A noisy, impenetrable and totally nonsensical cogitation on the nature of firefighters and the sizzling ""animal"" they love...We just wish somebody would call 911 for boredom."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,60,"If you can ignore the disturbing parallels with recent events, this middle-aged, Middle-American ""Attack The Block"" raises a laugh."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,60,"Some of the phallic jokes work, others are really lame. Fortunately there are many other funny bits that have nothing to do with body parts that keep the laughs coming."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,60,"As broad as a barn yet as thin as paper, The Watch is a summertime action-comedy that works almost in spite of its overcrowded cast and loose, pulpy spitball of a plot."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,55,"It's not that The Watch is terrible – it's not not terrible, but there are sufficient diversions and more punitive ways to spend your evening – but that it's one of those smoke bomb comedies that seems to disappear even while you're watching, leaving no trace of itself behind."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"Yes, it all gets kind of old, and yes, it's all over the place, but you'll probably find yourself laughing at least some of the time. Dick jokes, after all, can be pretty funny."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"The body part joke to alien joke ratio seems slightly skewed in favor of the former, which makes the humor more than a little repetitive. How many different ways can one film say: ""Men are idiots""?"
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"The Watch takes the same ethos of male bonding, obsession with sex and sardonic violence that has proved so profitable in recent years on yet another summer spin. The tires may be in need of changing pretty soon, but for now the jalopy still runs."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,The film is one long Costco joke - but the punch line is never all that funny.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"The end result is mediocre, slightly sloppy and a mild waste of a great cast."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"Reality aside, The Watch is harmless enough - and even occasionally humorous, in a riffy, sketch-comedy kind of way."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"What's onscreen feels as half-assed and juvenile as it was probably always envisioned to be, suggesting an umpteenth retelling of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" by way of ""The Hangover,"" or perhaps a far less inspired version of ""Attack the Block"" transplanted to small-town Ohio."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"It should be funnier. It should be better. Instead, it just sort of is."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,It sticks in the craw. The whole movie does.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"If this movie wanders into your neighborhood, the only watch that will hold your attention is the timepiece on your wrist."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"In spite of some prominently featured green slime and power-beam weaponry, it won't make anyone forget ""Ghostbusters"" anytime soon."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,50,"It's so determined to be crude, vulgar and offensive that after a while I grew weary. Abbott and Costello used to knock out funnier movies on this exact intellectual plane without using a single F, S, C, P or A word."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,42,"Certainly possesses a lot of energy, but it's never harnessed or focused effectively. As a buddy comedy, all four leads have done better, and you already know what those movies are, and this one doesn't stand among them."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,42,"If this amateur justice league spent as much time analyzing clues as they did analyzing their junk, in every slang variation available in the Urban Dictionary, the murder mystery in The Watch could have been solved on the first night of surveillance."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"Lacking the bite of ""Attack The Block,"" Stiller and co. are happy to fall back on their usual shtick, with director Schaffer providing barely enough juice to power the laughs."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"There's a secret weapon embedded within The Watch, however, and his name is Richard Ayoade."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"The Watch perks up when Ayoade's spacey line readings give it something unique and unexpected - otherwise, per Costco, audiences are buying their generic sci-fi comedy in bulk."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,The movie builds to a human-versus-alien showdown so sloppily staged that it makes little visual sense. The bargain-basement pyrotechnics suggest that much of The Watch was filmed on autopilot on a strict budget.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn play the guys they always play in this sci-fi comedy misfire.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"The Watch is awfully lightweight, and while it earns its R rating via some comic gore and a whole lot of hyper-sexualized tomfoolery, it's hardly the best work of anyone involved."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,40,"You're unlikely to laugh much, and you may get an unexpected case of the non-art-imitates-bad-life creeps."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,"Then there's the movie itself, which should be crazy, stupid fun but settles for just stupid."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,The Watch is a studio turd marinated in eau de skunk that stinks worse than week-old fish.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,"It's another one of those loud, penis-obsessed bro farces, lazily written (by actor Seth Rogen, among others) and haphazardly directed."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,38,"What's perhaps most off-putting about the movie isn't its increasingly stale humor, but the way it ultimately validates its characters' worst impulses."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,"It's a mash-up of blah buddy comedy and gross-out CGI monster splatter, with nary a laugh to be had."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,It's a dumb-ass comedy done strictly for a seriously large paycheque.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,The danger of dreaming up a predictable adventure for a group of nobodies you hold in contempt is that the audience will see your indifference and raise you.
The Watch,5.7,35353000,25,"As far as formulaic, empty and disappointing comedies go, The Watch is far from the worst. About every seven or eight minutes, perhaps a dozen times over the course of the picture, the movie generates a medium-size laugh. Not a big laugh."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,0,"This messy mix of sci-fi horror and post-Superbad raunchiness didn't make me laugh once. Not a single snicker, chortle or smile."
The Watch,5.7,35353000,0,"Every summer needs a super-turkey. So barring anything in the next 30 days that's the second coming of ""Howard the Duck,"" the witless, completely terrible ""comedy"" now called The Watch should win hands-down."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,100,"The Bounty is a great adventure, a lush romance, and a good movie."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,88,"The Bounty is an intelligent, firstrate, revisionist telling of the famous tale of Fletcher Christian's mutiny against Captain Bligh. Particularly distinguished by a sensational, and startlingly human, performance by Anthony Hopkins as Bligh, heretofore one of history's most one-dimensional villains."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,80,"The Bounty has an incredible cast and a fabulously well-put-together production, and pays impressive attention to historical accuracy – more than any of the previous cinematic recreations. With all this going for it, it's a pity that the drama falls flat."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,63,"Film is elegant but never beautiful, a pretence at Lean’s magnificence contradicted by a lavish but anachronistic score by Vangelis. It is the words and performances which excite; their director is out of his depth."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,60,"It's all a brave try, though Gibson is perhaps not up to the demands of a Christian's progress from naive rating to self-loathing exile, and Donaldson's direction often verges on the stolid."
The Bounty,7.1,8600000,60,"The movie seems to have been planned, written, acted, shot and edited by people who were constantly being overruled by other people. It's totally lifeless."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,80,Roger Moore’s third outing as Bond is undoubtedly his best.
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,80,"What The Spy Who Loved Me lacks when it comes to establishing the atmosphere of danger present in some the best Bond movies it makes up in spades in the creation of one apparently-impossible situation for the protagonist after the other, the kind that other entries would have been lucky to include a single example."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,75,"For the first time in three films, Roger Moore starts to unearth a personality for Bond."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,75,"Triple X posed an ideal opportunity for the series to rectify its dismissive treatment of women until this point, putting a lady on equal footing with Bond. To its credit, the film does feature a bit of screwball badinage between the two (a clunky bit about female drivers, unfortunately), but it has yet to introduce a single female character who doesn’t want to sleep with our hero."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,60,"The film moves along at a serviceable clip, but it seems half an hour too long, thanks to the obligatory shoot-'em-up conclusion, filmed on the largest sound-stage in the world, but nevertheless the dullest sequence here."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,It's the submarine barn and Richard Kiel's steel-toothed Jaws you remember from this one; the ostensible hero is just a fleshy blur.
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,"Gadgets abound, especially a Lotus sports car that transforms into a submarine. But the scene-stealer is 7'2"" Richard Kiel as Jaws, a shark-eating man with steel teeth."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,"As the Bond series moves deeper into the 1970s, the emphasis moves away from the inventive scripts that made the best Sean Connery films fine examples of the spy genre and toward the kind of feats of daring and visual spectacle that abound in The Spy Who Loved Me."
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,50,The film has its moments - Kiel's indestructible heavy racks up a good score - but the rest is desperately weak.
The Spy Who Loved Me,7.1,46800000,40,"While it never sags as alarmingly as its immediate predecessor, Spy, the 10th film in the series, is at best a tolerable disappointment."

Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"A zestful genre outing, and then some, right up its final overkill."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"Utterly preposterous but so full of enthusiasm and flashy style that it's entertaining anyway, The Brotherhood of the Wolf is like the platypus of genre films."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"Never pretends to be something that it isn't. Oh, there are costumes, to be sure, but that's just to facilitate the setting of the 18th century. Anyone who mistakes this for a costume drama is not aware of what kind of film they have ventured into."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"May be the most purely entertaining foreign-language crossover since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."""

Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,75,"All manner of superstitions, religious conspiracies and insurrections are aired, resulting less in awe than bewilderment. However, taken as an exciting and expansive cultural bridge, the film is a roaring success."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,70,"A little Sergio Leone here, a little ""Sleepy Hollow"" there, a grand helping of late royal-era Gaul with its wigs and finery, and, uh, martial arts-style confrontations galore are all deftly melded in Brotherhood of the Wolf."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,70,"This is one of those follies that go beyond pesky, bourgeois notions of ''good'' and ''bad.''"
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,70,"Despite an overlong running time and a punishing amount of violence and gore, it's a deeply ambitious picture, one of the most expensive and original to come out of France in many years."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,67,"The perfect film for anyone who likes their headbutting and kickboxing dressed up in gold brocade, frilly collars, and tri-cornered caps. And isn't that all of us?"
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,67,"At 140 minutes, the film becomes a humorless, long-winded spectacle."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,63,You have to admire a movie that endeavors to moosh together every successful cross-cultural action picture ever made.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,58,Much of the historical horrorfest is more frenetic than fascinating. Look out for bursts of over-the-top violence.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,Must we import the rubbish we export?
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,"Whatever it is, it's simultaneously on speed and Quaaludes; I don't know if any movie this profoundly insane has been seen in general release since Antonia Bird's Gold Rush cannibal comedy ""Ravenous."""
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,This new take on horror is more of the bloody same.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,An exuberantly garish French movie.
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,50,"Has its moments. In fact, it has too many of them. At 2 hours and 20 minutes and with enough characters to take up a few floors at a big hotel, it feels about an act too long."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,40,"Too ludicrous to be taken seriously, but not entertaining enough to rate as camp."
Le pacte des loups,7.1,11260096,40,"This one's a turkey as big as the Eiffel Tower but it's bad in a particularly American way: It's wildly overdone, it throws in everything in an attempt to appeal to everyone, it's gargantuan and anti-logical, pointlessly ornate and pointlessly violent."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"Quite simply, House of Flying Daggers is a film that sets several new standards for production and entertainment values. It is a wild riot of color, music, passion, action, mystery, pure old-fashioned thrills and even dancing."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"It's great, fantastical fun."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,House of Flying Daggers finds the great Chinese director at his most romantic in this thrilling martial arts epic that involves a conflict between love and duty carried out to its fullest expression.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"The most gorgeous movie of the year. This smashing martial-arts romance from Chinese director Zhang Yimou is stunning in other ways, too, like the eroticism that ripples just beneath the surface."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,The movie equivalent of a 12-course feast crammed with unforgettable images and mind-boggling stunts.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"The cast list is like a convocation of the Three Chinas: Taiwan's Kaneshiro, Hong Kong's Lau and the mainland's Zhang Ziyi. All are terrific, but the lady shines brightest."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"It's as thrilling and lushly beautiful a movie as has been released all year, matched only by Zhang's epic ""Hero."" And I think this film is the more powerful."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"Chinese director Zhang Yimou understands perfectly that the small can be epic and awe-inspiring. And, by the way, he knows how to get big, too."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,Zhang weaves in both thrilling martial-arts set pieces and stunning studies of period silk tapestry and costume.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"Forget about the plot, the characters, the intrigue, which are all splendid in House of Flying Daggers, and focus just on the visuals."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,The sheer joy of letting go as a tale overwhelms your senses and drives the known world away -- that's the story.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,This is the most intoxicatingly beautiful martial arts picture I've ever seen.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"It's action opera, sword-and-sorcery song-and-dance, and it's a heart-pumping, jaw-dropping thrill. OK, so I kind of like the thing."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,Its exquisiteness can overwhelm in a single sitting.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,By turns breathtaking and heartbreaking.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"He's (Yimou) like a painter combining bloody reds, sunshine yellows and pale blues in the harmony of a masterpiece."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,100,"An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression. At the same time, it offers something we rarely encounter in a whirling martial-arts extravaganza: a romantic passion that's woven into the very fabric of the action."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,91,A glorious new addition to martial-arts cinema.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,90,"I don't know if the many plot swerves withstand a second viewing, but I suspect the meat of the matter – the swooning visuals, the expert choreography, the teasing love story – does."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,89,"Forget ""Hero"" -- that cult hit was just Zhang Yimou's warm-up for this martial-arts fireball that throws in a lyrical love story, head-spinning fights and dazzling surprises."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,88,The result is one of the most visually astonishing martial-arts fantasies ever made.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,88,"The second action melodrama released in the United States this year by director Zhang Yimou, and if I prefer the previous one, ""Hero,"" it's partly a matter of degrees."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,83,The tangled tale of love and disguise is awesome in its action sequences but doesn't touch the heart to the same degree.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"The most seamless piece of sensuous expressionism Zhang has created since ""Ju Dou"" (1990)."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"A gorgeous entertainment, a feast of blood, passion and silk brocade. But though the picture is full of swirling, ecstatic motion, it is not especially moving."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"You feel wiped and blinded by such ravishment, yet a voice within you asks: Come on, guys, can't you just stop for the holidays?"
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,This is how action movies should be made.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,80,"If you think ""Hero"" is a sumptuous film, prepare to be blown away by House of Flying Daggers."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,"All told, while the goods that Daggers offers are choice, the movie ultimately demonstrates that too much can be, well, more than enough."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,It's a perfect example of how far production design and editing WON'T take you when the story's not there.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,"Actors Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro are the kind of startlingly good-looking, glamorous stars that evoke classic Hollywood adventure films."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,75,"Choreographed to the last beat, the action scenes have a depth that the film's thinly sketched characters never quite develop."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,70,If only this epic had enough substantial melodramatic hooks to hang this woman's beauty on; emotional traction is most often buried under acres of carefully coordinated vistas and CGI-hued flora.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,70,This film pivots on a romantic triangle as overwrought as it is stylized. It's like a Douglas Sirk melodrama ratcheted up with fists of fury and wrapped in apparently endless yards of shimmering silk.
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,70,"It's exuberant, exhilarating, poetic and -- intentionally and not -- rather silly."
Yeonin,7.6,11050094,67,Beautiful but hollow.
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,70,"More than anything, though, It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World embodies comic hugeness, for better or for worse. It isn’t the best comedy of all time, but it’s one of the largest and broadest."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,70,"It's a wonderfully crazy and colorful collection of ""chase"" comedy, so crowded with plot and people that it almost splits the seams of its huge Cinerama packing and its 3-hour-and-12-minute length."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,70,"Being a picture of extravagant proportions, even its few flaws are king-sized, but the plusses outweigh by far the minuses. It is a throwback to the wild, wacky and wondrous time of the silent screen comedy, a kind of Keystone Kop Kaper with modern conveniences."
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,67,There are enough giddy highs that it’s had a strong cult following ever since its release in 1963.
It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,63,"For a three-hour, epoch-ending epic made by a comedy neophyte, it yields a treasure of showbiz lore."

It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,7.6,46300000,37,Even Cinerama (its original format) can't expand on the poverty of comic invention.
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"Bay's movie couldn't be more timely; whatever you think about this subject, you might admire his attempt to come to grips with it in a summer blockbuster."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"It's got a hot premise, some cool sets, attractive stars and action that lets up only when it thinks you're about to surrender."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"The Island runs 136 minutes, but that's not long for a double feature. The first half of Michael Bay's new film is a spare, creepy science fiction parable, and then it shifts into a high-tech action picture. Both halves work."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"Bay's best film since ""The Rock."""
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"The movie is more about how many things Michael Bay can smash up -- lots. That might not be a talent most people respect, but it gets through to people anyway, and here Bay does it exceptionally well."
The Island,6.9,35818913,70,"Starts off an aggressively derivative sci-fi thriller, then morphs into an above-average chase melodrama."
The Island,6.9,35818913,70,"Glossy, witty eye candy with some moderately chewy stuff in the middle. This lavish, exhaustingly kinetic film is smarter than you might expect, and at the same time dumber than it could be. It's an impressive product: a triumph of cloning that almost convinces you that it possesses a soul."
The Island,6.9,35818913,67,Make no mistake: This not high art. But it does its job without insulting our intelligence or unpleasantly jangling our nerves.
The Island,6.9,35818913,67,The final third...is so overblown and anticlimactic that it finally gets you thinking about empty profundity and loose ends.
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,There's enough fun to be had that it's almost possible to ignore the stupidity of the story and the cavity that replaces character development.
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"Bay's strength as a filmmaker, the reason his superficial yet entertaining productions can never be completely ignored, is that he appears to lack shame. He'll blow anything up and run anybody over. The moral complexities don't matter to him. He just wants to stage spectacles, appreciate very good-looking people, and assert his cowboy aesthetic."
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"As the careening cars go splat, splat, splat, the director's vision of the future looks like a cheerfully mindless combination of two extremes of carnival entertainment: demolition derby and whack-a-mole."
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"Scarlett Johansson looks lovely and hasn't much to do besides that, McGregor only starts having fun when he's playing the ""original"" of his clone."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"Frenetic actioner about refugees from a genetic cloning plant starts off intriguingly, burns up its ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest with joltingly repetitive action sequences."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"This is pure essence of Bay--it's big, it's loud, it has no context, and if you show up tanked, I'm sure it's really quite poetic."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"There is nothing wrong with the action sequences beyond their sheer length and number. They're in the ""Road Warrior"" mode: hyper-fast and vicious."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"Like its slack-jawed clones, The Island is full of energy and incredibly pretty but burdened with only the minimum of smarts."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"For all the menace of its techno-prattle, its implicit boosts for humanism and its swell production design, the picture is finally a bore. Sci-fi was more powerful when its special effects were cheap and crude, its ideas simple but potently stated."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island begins with a whimper of interest as a cool-hued, cautionary exploration of the ethics of cloning, and ends, in a hail of product placement, with a dumb bang."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"As usual, Hollywood hitmeister Bay is more interested in blowing stuff up than in addressing deep questions like the morality of science and the false myths of civilization, and these explosions go on for over two hours."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,Nary an original idea abounds in The Island.
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Classic Bay, except it's missing the crass director's fine-tuned rhythm, his feel for adrenaline, his breakneck edits and sense of humor."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The best thing about The Island is this: Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, buffed and dressed in sparkling white, wondering how and when to kiss each other."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The first half is high-quality science fiction, the rest is a high-tech chase adventure with a gleeful yen for destructive thrills."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island could be read as a metaphor for societal ills (commercialization, conformity, pharmaceutical overkill) if it weren't so shamelessly dumb. And dumb it is."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Chases, crashes and explosions are thick on the land in the second half of this movie, but though they are expertly done, their size, frequency and increasing disconnection from what was once a coherent story leave you feeling pummeled rather than exhilarated."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"This frenzied fiesta of firepower is about cloning people for spare parts, but the movie is a clone itself. Possessing no new ideas, it reworks and borrows from such films as ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix"" and ""Logan's Run."""
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"For a slick pop entertainment, more than the usual quotient of timely ideas rattle around between the relentless product placements and futuristic geegaws."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Steve Buscemi supplies the only spark of intelligent life in this numbingly flat universe, despite the fancy gadgets, the high-speed chases, and a skyscraper collision reminiscent of the World Trade Center attacks."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" The Island is the kind of suicidal high-concept movie increasingly prevalent these days: a film so thoroughly pre-conceived and pre-sold that most audiences know more about what's going on than the characters do for half the movie."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Unfortunately, The Island grows dumber as it goes along, gradually disintegrating into a generic good-versus-evil spectacular that not only defies all known laws of gravity and physics, but also suffers from the lack of morality that plagues Bay's films."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island walks a weird, wobbly line between being stupid, falsely fattened-up entertainment and a picture that just might have possibly been made by a person with a brain -- a scrambled one, but a brain nonetheless."
The Island,6.9,35818913,40,What makes this movie so inadequate is that there are some moments in it that could have been really worth watching.
The Island,6.9,35818913,40,"An overblown science-fiction epic in which ostensibly unthinking, unfeeling stem-cell-like entities not only think and feel, but look and act like glamorous movie stars."
The Island,6.9,35818913,38,"A borrowed idea -- hello, ""Blade Runner,"" hi there, ""Matrix"" -- but an idea nonetheless."
The Island,6.9,35818913,30,"If you like ""Maxim,"" you will love The Island. It is glossy. It is expensive. It has lots of slick ads for Aquafina and Cadillac."
The Island,6.9,35818913,30,"If you find yourself at ""The Island"" I have only three words of advice: Vote yourself off."
Everest,7.1,43482270,89,"This is a movie you feel deeply in the pit of your stomach. Sometimes, it literally hurts to watch it."
Everest,7.1,43482270,88,"The mountain, grim and unforgiving, remains the star."
Everest,7.1,43482270,88,This is what filmed spectacle used to look like — a  trip to a place or time most of us could never see.
Everest,7.1,43482270,83,"It lacks the same constant surprises of last year's ""Gravity"" or the visual poetry of ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but Kormákur's movie nonetheless marks the rare fusion of effective craftsmanship with focused storytelling."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"It succeeds wonderfully, offering moviegoers a rare taste of rarified air -- and as compelling an argument as you can make for seeing a movie writ large on the oversized screen of an actual movie theater."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"Like the mountain for which it’s named, Everest is rock solid. It’s big, it’s beautiful, it’s terrifying, and it’s merciless to both its characters and the audience."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,Kormákur creates such a convincing world – the craft of this film is astonishing – that you’re willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favour of its totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend into a place that’s heaven one moment and hell the very next.
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't feel like one. And that's a good thing."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There is no tragic hero here; there is no overarching explanation, but a movie that offered either of those would seem pretty pat. Take it or leave, Everest is just there."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"Part IMAX nature documentary and part Hollywood disaster movie, it does an effective job of conveying what it’s like to climb the mountain, the hours and days spent acclimating on practice hikes, and the punishing physical effects that accompany each subsequent change of altitude."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"In this case, character development is neglected in favor of awe-inspiring views. There are times when we feel like we're on the mountain. Unfortunately, our companions - the men and women populating the screen - are never more than half-formed."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,Director Baltasar Kormákur (“2 Guns”) and his cast craft a lean narrative tone that humanizes the action without an excess of gloss.
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There have been plenty of mountaineering documentaries over the last few years, and Everest suffers in comparison to them simply by being a dramatization. As realistic as the effects are (and you can occasionally tell when a shot is green-screened), you're still aware on a gut level that Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were not actually filmed at 29,000 feet above sea level."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There's only one star in this movie: Everest. Kormákur couldn't shoot higher than base camp, around 14,000 feet, without sickening the actors. But a crew traveled to the top to get footage, while much of the climbing was shot in the Dolomites. No matter. You watch Everest and you believe."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, Baltasar Kormakur’s Everest is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained."
Everest,7.1,43482270,70,"Everest may disappoint those looking for a more awe-inspiring film with big vistas and jaw-dropping stunts and acts of surreal heroism. Unlike many mountain-disaster stories, this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again."
Everest,7.1,43482270,70,"Kormakur doesn’t make the mistake of exalting his subjects as extraordinary individuals, or suggesting that they were obeying some sort of noble higher calling. Everest is blunt, businesslike and — as it begins its long march through the death zone — something of an achievement."
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns) essentially made a faux documentary with big stars and better lighting.
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,"When the lights come up, you don’t want to feel like you’ve watched a ­better Cliffhanger. You want to understand the tragedy you’ve just watched. Yes, you want to be entertained, but you also want the icy, whipping wind of reality to sting."
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,"Salvatore Totino's crisp 3D photography and Kormakur's way with a clear, fluid, thrilling action sequence show off the mountain in immensely impressive ways. But the humans involved get short shrift."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,There’s a resemblance here to both the story and the movie adaptation of the story told in “The Perfect Storm.” The characters involved are making a good faith effort—but good faith efforts by humans can only go so far.
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"It feels less like an cautionary adventure movie or the classy Hollywood equivalent of a Reader's Digest ""Drama in Real Life"" and much more like a disaster epic."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"Everest gets several things right, but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"A fairly good, extremely grueling movie as far as it goes — tracks the true-life fortunes of a battered group of climbers to the highest place on Earth. Yet somehow it doesn't go far enough."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Though there is heroism as well as love here, because it involves the deaths of people we have come to care about, Everest is finally a sad story, though not always a dramatically involving one."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest is a sprawling mess of a movie, one you feel like could have been great but instead roams all over the place and winds up being just pretty good."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest is visually splendid, though it loses a few points for its murkiness in rendering its main characters as distinct individuals."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"A valiant effort that never quite scales the dizzy emotional heights required, running out of oxygen in the final act. Visually, though, it’s stunning."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Spectacular and well-acted, this suffers from much the same problem as the situation it depicts — too many people on the mountain and too many threads to follow so that affecting individual stories get lost in the snow."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Ultimately, Everest is not concerned with the why, but with the how and it's grimly efficient at building up the drama, helped on by Clarke's wonderful character study, even if the film as a whole never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its subject."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"The hardship of the trek is vividly and stomach-lurchingly portrayed, particularly when the storm sets in, but it never makes the crucial leap from the screen into your bones."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"This is one of those cases where fictionalizing a true event, or at least fusing two or three real people into one composite character, might have resulted in tighter storytelling."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest, in short, suffers from the same problem as Everest: overcrowding."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"The feature film Everest provides soaring visuals, but it’s a distant second in terms of storytelling depth and narrative impact."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"Though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, Everest feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"While it’s impossible not to be somewhat caught up in these climbers’ life-or-death struggle, Everest is oddly uninvolving — it depicts a horrific scenario in an underwhelming, distancing way."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"Everest is a frustrating movie in many ways – despite some lurches and shocks, it doesn’t quite deliver the edge-of-your-seat thrills that many were hoping for, and all those moderately engaging characters mean that there is no centrally powerful character."
Everest,7.1,43482270,40,"The director was Baltasar Kormákur, a gifted filmmaker from Iceland who shouldn’t be blamed for a case of industrial filmmaking gone wrong — the culprits in elaborate clunkers like this are usually the producers and the studios."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,83,"Once one is acclimated to this chaos-cinema form, even if it’s a bit more assaultive in post-converted 3D, the writer-director’s simultaneous economic storytelling and boyish imagination come into clear view."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,75,"Like most films of its type, “The Final Chapter” is utterly ridiculous in every possible way but unlike a lot of them (I am looking at you, “Underworld”), it at least has a healthy sense of its own absurd nature that comes as a blessed relief. And a couple of the action bits are gloriously goofy to behold."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,75,"For fans of “Resident Evil,” I believe this final film will not disappoint, but it also will likely encourage newcomers to the saga to go back and play a bit of catch-up by watching the earlier movies."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,67,"The climax makes for a satisfying conclusion to the franchise—an ending which this writer expects, and even hopes, all concerned will studiously ignore when they get around to making the next one."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,66,"For the first time, the story supports and adds to the action rather than distract from it; it’s almost as though Anderson was holding back in the earlier films because he wanted to save the best for last."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,63,The Resident Evil films are so unconcerned with traditional character and narrative that they suggest either abstract art or the fevered brainstorming of a child at play.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,There’s no denying the movie’s climactic gathering of females bent on saving the species.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,"Boasting a higher body count than its IQ, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is violent, idiotic fun."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,"The movie percolates enough that even when, at its climax, it shamelessly recycles a grisly punch line from 1987’s “RoboCop,” it’s kind of endearing, not least because Mr. Anderson and company make it work."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,58,Combining Anderson’s symmetrical camera style with frenetic editing ends up imploding the sense of depth and space that has long made the director’s movies must-sees in 3-D.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,50,"Jovovich binds the episodic action sequences, her face a mask of noble pain and isolation. She outruns zombies, orchestrates catapults of flaming gasoline, literally slays a dragon with a Hummer – and all without a single unnecessary quip or wasted kiss."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,50,"A few individual scenes of hand-to-hand and foot-to-face combat are undeniably exciting, and Jovovich once again impresses with her kinetic athleticism. Overall, however, the repetitiveness and occasional incoherence of the nonstop action leave the audience exhausted for all the wrong reasons."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,Reasonably entertaining but hectic (supposed) finale for the up-and-down series.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"Hush and patience are simply not in Anderson’s vocabulary. He bombards you as if terrified of encroaching tedium, and the set pieces trip each other up in their sheer haste."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"The action is practically non-stop from beginning to end, but is never remotely exciting due to the Cuisinart-style editing that reduces it all to an incomprehensible, messy blur."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"True, the movie's intense, and Jovovich is certainly in fighting shape. But after 15 years of this franchise, it's getting hard to tell Alice from the things she's fighting. It's all squint and grunt, slash and groan."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,30,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter proves that there's nothing left in the tank of this grossly nondescript zombie-shootin' franchise.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,25,There’s a fascinating satire of America’s unholy alliance of heartless corporations and the religious dupes who worship them just sitting here. But it’ll take a wit far cleverer than action hack Paul W.S. Anderson to work that out.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,20,The film is drab and epileptic.

Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"Off-and-on cynical and sentimental, Russell's darkly comic tale shows how much can be done with familiar material when you're burning to do things differently and have the gifts to pull that off."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,Enormously entertaining.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"One of the most exciting Hollywood action films in years, and the best Vietnam movie since ""Apocalypse Now."""
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"Blackly funny, unafraid to shift emotional gears from farce to horror, peppered with spectacular action."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,A brilliant exercise in popular but palpable surrealism.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"It's like a madly inventive hybrid of ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."""
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"The visuals are wild, the sound track has the audacity to underscore the subtext instead of just echoing the obvious, the comedy is irreverent and occasionally slapstick, and the metaphorical details are consistently strong."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,"A war movie with a conscience, an action movie with a funny bone, a caper movie with a shifting agenda."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,90,You walk out amazed and refreshed by the way it kicks the assumptions out from under the genre.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,89,Impossible to resist.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"A work of strangely bold, distinctly American pop art - proud to be ashamed, ashamed to be proud, unafraid to ignore its commercial bearings."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"Exhilarating, alternately funny and horrific film."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"Russell has combined pathos, terror, and black comedy with a dollop of Hollywood feel-good patriotism to make one of the best studio efforts this year."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,88,"As entertaining as it is a viable, political message destined to make viewers rethink their stance on war."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,86,An astonishing movie that keeps you off-balance from the first scene.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,83,"So overstuffed with random fireworks that despite its politics, it's easy to imagine the film getting a four-star rave from Bush or Saddam."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,80,"Visual pyrotechnics and dark humor aside, Three Kings rules because it dares to dig for such truths, whether banal or significant."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"A genre movie with an agenda that's too packed. Inevitably, some of the many balls it's juggling get dropped -- (but it's) one of the most entertaining and original actioners in several years."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"So wild an approach demands straightforward performances that don't draw attention to themselves, and that's what the actors supply."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"Better than the usual Hollywood rot, but dialectical it ain't."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,75,"Closer to ""M*A*S*H"" than ""Dr. Strangelove,"" which in itself wouldn't be a bad thing. But for all its engaging qualities, Three Kings doesn't seem to know what kind of beast it is."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,"An impudently comic, stylistically aggressive and, finally, very thoughtful manner."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,A nifty little war movie that defies convenient categorization.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,"Increasingly muddled, cumulatively monotonous, would-be heartwarming, Three Kings becomes its own entertainment allegory -- searching, Hollywood style, for the point at which blatant self-interest can turn humanitarian, while still remaining profitable."
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,70,Russell's stylish and imaginative filmmaking wages its own war against lunkheaded and sometimes offensive material.
Three Kings,7.1,60652036,50,It isn't nearly as successful a showcase for this filmmaker's extraordinary talents.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,90,This bloody celebration finally gives the American Revolution the epic it deserves.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,90,Doesn't try too hard to be anything other than a vicarious experience that makes you crave the satisfaction you know you'll get when the hero gets his revenge.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"It has everything you want in an epic: sweep, scope, wild reversals of fortune and plenty of bold, basic emotions."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"Sentimental, overbearing, flag-waving--and a crowd-pleaser."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"If Emmerich had any sense, he would have ceded the direction of the battle scenes to his star."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,Has a flag-waving dumbness at its core.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It is rousing and entertaining, and you get your money's worth."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It's big, exciting, ambitious, and it makes you cry in all the right places."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"What might have been a treat for history buffs and a refresher course for the rest of us turns into just another occasion to watch Gibson shoot guns, swing tomahawks, and wreak other kinds of havoc on enemies we've been primed to hate."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"Emmerich might have had a masterpiece, but he'll have to settle for what comes close to being a must-see movie today."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It's often corny, but it's never boring, and it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,The best movie I've seen about the Revolutionary War.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,It's depressing that this first movie in years to dramatize the American Revolution has so little to do with the politics of secession and so much to do with pop-culture themes of vigilantism.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"Mostly, the movie is riveting, well-done fare -- the stuff of Hollywood epic adventure."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,Has some emotional pull and isn't stuffy and dull.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"Only so much (pop)cornball tubthumping, a sweeping, occasionally stirring, always gorgeous bit of action-figure history."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"There's no denying that Emmerich's film, though a good half hour too long, keeps us watching."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"""We, the people"" have never been big fans of movies about the American Revolutionary War. The Patriot, however, appears to be the movie that will break that historical jinx."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,67,It's a death-wish revenge thriller posing as a lavishly pastoral historical epic.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,67,"Far from the smart historical epic some might have expected, is just another feisty summer shoot-'em-up."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"As a whole, though, the movie is much less magnetic or believable than its star."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"While the film contains some terrific, realistically bloody battle scenes, it has a distinctly Germanic feel, both in its epic heaviness and in the peculiar way it revises the history of the American Revolution."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"Gibson's performance is robbed of his customary humor, and he flounders around in search of the character's core."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Patriot reflects on nothing, except perhaps that the American Revolution was a golden opportunity for Mel Gibson to go postal."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Shamelessly stirring, brandishing Mr. Gibson's anguished masculinity like a musket. It may be effective, but you leave the theater feeling used."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Trots out more flag-waving wartime cliches than any movie since John Wayne's ""The Alamo."""
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,Does benefit from Gibson's charisma...Whether it is quite good enough is another question.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"A movie of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial Williamsburg sets."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"The film is long, empty and bogus."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Seems likely to stir rebuttal from historians, especially those on the other side of the pond."

The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Undeniably handsome..., but no cliché is left unturned, right down to the spray of toy soldiers falling from the hand of a dead child. Everything old isn't new again."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Whatever extraordinary ingredients are necessary to fashion a 1776 home run, this movie doesn't have them."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,44,Overblown sanctimony and sentimentalism as corny as the Fourth of July.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,The triumphant masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa's fertile twilight.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"In Ran, the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"One of the 10 best films ever made, period."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Stands separate from the rest, in a pantheon, a true cinematic masterwork of sight, sound, intelligence, and most importantly--passion."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,It’s a dazzlingly successful addition to [Kurosawa's] distinguished career.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,Ran represents the color/widescreen zenith (qualification necessary due to Seven Samurai) of Kurosawa’s genius for spectacle.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"The physical scale of Ran is overwhelming. It's almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood`s phrase, ""Go ahead, ruin your night""--wait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Ran, which translates as ""chaos"" or ""turmoil,"" is at once brisk and vital, elegiac and contemplative, intimate and epic, tragic yet shot through with humor. It combines the energy of youth with the perspective of maturity. It encompasses all of human nature in its folly and grandeur, and it does so in images as beautiful and terrifying as any ever captured on film and in performances that are impeccable."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Quite simply, Ran is a great, nightmarish motion picture."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"If Shakespeare's poetry enters the mind through the ear, Kurosawa's enters it through the eye. But the imagery is of comparable quality, at once awesome in its power, delicate in its irony and, finally, for all the violence of the events it recounts, eerily serene in the sureness with which it achieves its effects."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,The drama itself packs a powerful -- and timeless -- gut punch.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, ''Ran'' has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"Ran is a great, glorious achievement."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,A stunning achievement in epic cinema.
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"In Ran, color plays a role not unlike that of language in ""Lear"": a kind of ground bass of beauty, a product of pure imagination, that both affirms life and surpasses it. Yet Kurosawa uses that beauty more as negation: a reminder not of what man is capable of but how puny he is in comparison."
Ran,8.2,3522421,100,"A magisterial film, but not quite a great one."
Ran,8.2,3522421,95,"Save for one startlingly staged battle sequence. . .might as well have been titled ""Also Ran."""
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,60,It’s utterly ridiculous – and impossible to resist.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,Gods of Egypt is often sloppy and fails in many ways but the cheesy momentum is hard to resist.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"It’s all quest, flash and high action."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"It’s a spectacular mess that’s shameless in its desire to entertain through sheer, misbegotten excess."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"A treasure trove of gilded fantasy bric-a-brac and clashing accents, Proyas’ sword-and-sandals space opera is a head above the likes of Wrath Of The Titans, but it rapidly devolves into a tedious and repetitive succession of monster chases, booby traps, and temples that start to crumble at the last minute."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,The alternately cornball and self-aware dialogue and the clearly not state-of-the-art CGI would seeming charmingly retro (like something from a TV miniseries two decades ago) if the movie didn't trot out one epic action film cliche after another.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,42,"While the film becomes a constant test to outdo itself, the raw ambition isn’t nearly enough to make up for the content of the actual film: an ungainly, ugly, nearly interminable monstrosity."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"It’s both thin and overstuffed, filled with intricate, at times dazzling set-pieces peopled by characters we don’t care about, and an irreverent sense of fun that nevertheless leaves us cold. It tries so hard… and ultimately achieves so little."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"If Gods of Egypt were any worse, it might be a masterpiece."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"As audience-friendly as they may be, the cast is left wading through the middle ground between the unengaging narrative and over-emphasised aesthetics."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,38,"There’s a long year ahead of us, but Gods of Egypt is going to stand out as one of the sillier, more puzzling big budget, special-effects driven period pieces to come out."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,33,"Gods of Egypt is a dull, meandering, plastic mess of pre-2002 CGI and performances as flat as the green screens behind them."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,30,"This is by any measure a dreadful movie, a chintzy, CG-encrusted eyesore that oozes stupidity and self-indulgence from every pore. Yet damned if Proyas doesn’t put it all out there with a lunatic conviction you can’t help but admire."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Like the lobby of a Donald Trump building, it looks ever so expensive and amazingly cheap at the same time."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,Imagine the worst costume epic imaginable. Imagine no more. It exists.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,Its virtues as throwback don't elide the foolhardly decision to imprint an ancient mythology on a contemporary superhero framework.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Gods of Egypt might have merited a so-bad-it’s-good schadenfreude fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes. Instead, it skids into dullness, thus negating the camp classic that it so often verges on becoming."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,A shoddy special-effects howler that makes a hash out of both Egyptian mythology and human logic.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Call it ""Clash of the Whitans,"" and call it a folly that doesn't have the energy or delirium to qualify as entertaining crap. It's just crap."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,"As the film totters to its predictable finale, the closing moments set up a sequel, a prospect far more terrifying than anything we've just seen."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,"This overstuffed, witless and bloated stillborn $140 million epic is unlikely to spawn the studio's intended franchise — unless, as is so often the case, international audiences come to the box-office rescue."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,Director Alex Proyas’ movie feels like a bad video game.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Avoid it like the plagues.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Some movies are so effing awful they're hilarious. Gods of Egypt falls short of that lofty goal. Not because it isn’t effing awful — it so is — but because it pretends to be in on the joke.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Gods of Egypt is an epic — an epic disaster.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,100,"As a fictional, big-budget, 3-D, epic interpretation of Moses’ journey, Exodus: Gods and Kings is spectacular."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,90,"What’s remarkable about Scott’s genuinely imposing Old Testament psychodrama is the degree to which he succeeds in conjuring a mighty and momentous spectacle — one that, for sheer astonishment, rivals any of the lavish visions of ancient times the director has given us — while turning his own skepticism into a potent source of moral and dramatic conflict."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,80,"As spectacular and surprising as you would expect from Scott. Its spiritual uncertainty – and lack of triumphalism – perhaps robs it of a truly satisfying, cathartic conclusion, but also makes for a truly modern, thoughtful biblical blockbuster."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,80,Scott operates on a suitably Biblical scale and grounds the spectacle with rock-solid turns from Bale and Edgerton.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,75,"It’s not a question of believing it, exactly. Director Ridley Scott has simply made us want to be there, to wish we really were there, and to accept his illusion as the most ready answer to that desire."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,75,"Is it possible to sit through a movie, mentally cataloging its absurdities, and still walk out dazzled? Because that pretty much sums up my experience watching Ridley Scott's eye-candy spectacle Exodus: Gods and Kings, an over-the-top Old Testament epic that's essentially Gladiator with God."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,75,"For all its stunning and stark wilderness settings (Spain and the Canary Islands), its stunning effects, technical proficiency and scriptural cleverness, Exodus is a chilly affair... It’s still an exciting, entertaining epic."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,70,"As uneven as Ridley Scott’s career; at times, it seems to be a journey through the director’s greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out; the bad news is all the awkward storytelling and botched character interactions we have to wade through to get to the good stuff. Once we do, though, Exodus is a hoot."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,67,"Exodus is an entertainment of the first order. I’m not so sure about the filmmaker’s decision to render the Metatron archangel as a 9-year-old boy, but what the hell? You get hit on the head with a boulder, who knows what you’ll see?"
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"Scott’s “Exodus” is dutiful, deeply earnest, and more than a little dull."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"How you respond to the totality of Exodus: Gods and Kings will, I suspect, relate directly to how you responded to Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" from 2010. Square, a little heavy on its feet, much of that film held me, even when its bigness trumped its goodness. Same with this one."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"In Exodus: Gods and Kings, Scott settles for sticking (mostly) to the Book, skipping the boring parts in order to dish out the razzle-dazzle. This is spectacular entertainment, practically a theme park ride, that could have used more spirituality and soul."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"Exodus is a biblical epic that comes at you at maximum velocity but stays stirringly, inspiringly human."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"Whilst the tone is off, and the talented cast wasted, Exodus is, at times highly entertaining, albeit unintentionally."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"For all of the care and imagination that have been lavished on the production, which was designed by Arthur Max and photographed by Dariusz Wolski, the film’s impact is best expressed by frequent aerial shots that are visually impressive and emotionally remote."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"As with the DeMille ventures, enjoyment here involves managing expectations and not taking things too seriously."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"This is bold and uncompromising stuff from Scott; a Biblical epic to shake your faith in the order of things, not reaffirm it."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"It is half turkey, half triumph."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"No movie with such a limp ending can be fully satisfying, and the beginning also falters.  But the long middle section is a rousing good show."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,59,"Even with exhilarating plague montages and stomach-dropping illusions of scale amid the many battles, the characteristically brilliant shots for which the famed director is known can’t compensate for the completely tone-deaf overall result—so far removed from the days in which the filmmaker brought us Alien."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,58,"When we last see a much older Moses en route to Canaan, we can at least be grateful that this film, unlike so many other movies these days, does not seem primed for a sequel."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"As for Bale, he seems to have lost his compass. His accent strays, his famous intensity wasted on clunky dialogue."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"At 2 1/2 hours, the movie is actually too short to adequately tell the full tale (The Ten Commandments is 70 minutes longer) but that doesn't prevent Scott from presenting multiple, seemingly endless scenes of people crossing deserts."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Exodus is ludicrous only by accident, which isn’t much fun and is the surest sign of what we might call a New Testament sensibility at work. But the movie isn’t successfully serious, either... To be fair, there is some good stuff here, too. Mr. Scott is a sinewy storyteller and a connoisseur of big effects."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,A handsome movie with a handsome leading man. Christian Bale is widely considered the finest actor of his generation. Yet here he’s adrift in the bulrushes. This might be the most indifferent performance of Bale’s career.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"the performances, even from some really good actors, are wooden, the huge CGI effects are a distraction and the best thing about the movie is the one thing that, other than the casting, will probably make the most people angry: God is a kid."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Swarms of flies, oozing pustules, alligator attacks and gaggles of frogs are vividly rendered in three dimensions in Exodus: Gods and Kings. And yet this biblical epic is still bland, overly long and otherwise forgettable."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Scott loses the humanity amid all the gods and kings. The setpieces, however, elevate the film around them."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"If nothing else, Exodus: Gods And Kings makes it easier to appreciate Darren Aronofsky’s ""Noah,"" which, for all of its flaws, was at least animated by a personal relationship to the Old Testament."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"For a story that's pro-poor and anti-wealth, every frame of it looks like it cost as much as human life itself — and that, more than any bludgeoned battle cries for freedom, is the pleasure of the film."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Exodus: Gods and Kings illustrates a typical contradiction of commercial entertainment: By playing it safe, the movie fails to enrich the material, and never captures the energy that has made its narrative so captivating for millennia."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,47,"This stodgy adaptation creaks with solemnity — not to mention reactionary casting choices — and apart from some nifty frog and locust infestations, even the special effects pale next to a wind-blown Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,42,"As an action spectacular, Exodus is on par with Scott's other forays into ancient times, ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven."" But as a believable human drama, much less a worthy exploration of Judaism's origins, it falls flat."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,42,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is a creaky, sometimes painfully boring Old Testament slog, and finds the visionary director unable to successfully wrangle a human story out of a tale of gods and kings."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,38,"A numbing and soulless spectacle of 3-D, computer-generated imagery run amok, Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings presents an enduring tale by pummeling us over the head with it."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,38,"While the pale skin tones (bronzer is selectively applied) and haphazard mix of American and British accents is distracting, it barely scratches the surface of Exodus’s ungainly artificiality."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,38,"It doesn't take long to realize that Ridley Scott's adaptation is only aiming for certain forms of credibility, and callously eschewing others."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,33,"This is that rare case where it feels like every choice Scott made was off, and the cumulative impact of all of these choices is one of the most crushing disappointments of the year in terms of who made the film and how little of it works."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,25,"This biblical action drama that feels excessive in every way imaginable, from running time (nearly 2 1/2  hours) to melodramatic acting to the conspicuous amount of computer generation."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,25,"An utterly clueless, relentlessly grim and rambling action epic guaranteed to displease devout Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, amuse atheists — and generally bore everyone."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,25,"On the plus side, Scott's plagues are cool. But it's a long slog to crocodile rocking, pestilence and Proactiv-proof sores."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,20,"I can’t fault Ridley Scott for wanting to stage a version of this saga, just as I can’t ignore the fact that my dad tells the same tale every spring, but much more engagingly, in half the time and drunk on Manischewitz."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,20,"This eye-rollingly bad movie is silly, sluggish and miscast."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,60,What raises Death Wish 4 above the usual blowout is a semi-engaging script and sure pacing by veteran action director J. Lee Thompson.
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,60,"Gail Morgan Hickman's complicated script manages a couple of nice twists, but it's too formulary to pursue the ambiguities it reveals. Most enjoyable is the clear thread of self-parody, which keeps the laughs and bullets coming thick and fast."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,60,"Death Wish 4 may be preposterous, but on the level of technique it's a solid textbook example of crisp exploitation picture craftsmanship. Thompson clearly takes pleasure in setting up every scene with maximum economy and impact, and his work is that of a professional without apologies."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,50,"Death Wish 4 is as efficient and predictable as Kersey himself, and inoffensive as long as you can root for a sociopathic hero."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,25,"No one was exactly clamoring for this one, and Bronson has vowed it will be the last Death Wish."
Death Wish 4: The Crackdown,5.4,6880310,25,"This time around, there's barely any plot, just excuses for Bronson to blow people away."
Species,5.8,60074103,80,"Species is an Alien ripoff, but that doesn't make it a bad movie--not when it contains a plausible premise, a great-looking female villain, a wonderful supporting cast of good guys, and genuine tension. Only a routine chase sequence in sewer tunnels limits the excitement at the end. In other words, we're talking about a solid, surprisingly intelligent action picture here."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,"A propulsive sci-fi actioner genetically engineered from spores of the Alien and Terminator series, Roger Donaldson's Species provides a gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,"Director Roger Donaldson has a lot of fun with his premise. The top-notch special effects, which use a lot of seamless computer animation, make the climax look very nice. The rest of the film is essentially one long chase sequence with a couple of nude scenes and maulings added to liven up the proceedings. No matter what genre you identify Species as, it's not top of the line, but there's also quite a bit of room beneath it."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,Despite the ridiculous premise and casting this is still a pacey little sci-thriller.
Species,5.8,60074103,70,"I can imagine a film in which a creature like Sil struggles with her dual nature, and tries to find self-knowledge. Like Frankenstein's monster, she would be an object of pity. But that would be way too subtle for Species, which just adds a slick front end to the basic horror vocabulary of things jumping out from behind stuff."
Species,5.8,60074103,63,"If Species sounds ridiculous, it is -- though as ridiculous science fiction films go, this one has its moments. As usual, these moments come early."
Species,5.8,60074103,63,"The direction by Roger Donaldson is facile and understated, as is, for the most part, the script by Dennis Feldman. Even the actors pitch in to play down the silliness of it all."
Species,5.8,60074103,60,"A shameless Alien rip-off (it even uses a similar typeface in its ads), it makes no sense whatsoever. But don't hold the movie's utter unoriginality and brainlessness against it. A few laughs, a few popcorn-jolting scares—what more do you want on a hot summer night?"
Species,5.8,60074103,60,"Alien meets Basic Instinct in this textbook illustration of what happens when millions of dollars' worth of technical expertise is brought to bear on a cheap, exploitative script."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"It doesn’t help that the special effects are second-rate; the squishy primal horror of Alien has been replaced by a kind of mechanized yuckiness. The team of B-movie scientists tracking the monster includes Ben Kingsley doing his over-deliberate American accent, Alfred Molina sporting a haircut that’s scarier than the creature, and Forest Whitaker as an empath so sensitive he can’t let anyone sneeze without making a dewy-eyed psychic pronouncement."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,Species carries the whole idea of the erotic thriller--that '80s yuppie genre that mixed sex and slaughter--past cliche into howling absurdity.
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"The director, Roger Donaldson, best known for the Kevin Costner thriller No Way Out, keeps the film moving. But there is only so much suspense he can generate from this stock story and familiar-looking special effects. Species may work best for viewers who don't like to be too scared by horror movies; it's reassuringly familiar."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"Director Roger Donaldson may have started out aiming for intentional thrills, but ends up with unintentional comedy as his characters do and say the darndest things."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"Like some state-of-the-art remake of Lifeforce, this is every bit as bad as Tobe Hooper's film, but nothing like as enjoyable. Worst is the transition in the final scenes from snatched glimpses of a woman in a rubber suit to some oddly alienating motion-control effects. Floating like the ghosting on a poorly tuned TV, these are far too clean and artificial to be believable or remotely scary. Deserves extinction."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"What else can I say about a movie in which even a brilliant artist like H.R. Giger repeats himself… except that besides a few random moments, Species just doesn't make the grade and also manages to waste a fine cast along the way."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,90,"But where most rugged he-man films feature a few action sequences scattered throughout, director Renny Harlin keeps the adventure stuff in this reputed $ 65 million production coming at an astonishing pace."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,80,"All of the performers are upstaged by the film's breathtaking backdrop, and by the fast and furious way Renny Harlin, the director, approaches action sequences."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,80,Action filmmaking at its best; a career high for director Harlin and arguably Stallone as well.
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,80,"Director Harlin's only large mistake is staging the several violent deaths too authentically. They momentarily mar the high-speed implausibility of a movie that, like his Die Hard 2, agreeably combines the edgy and the genial."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,78,It grabs you by the viscera in the opening prologue and for the next two hours rarely lets go.
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,75,Movies like this are machines for involving us and thrilling us. Cliffhanger is a fairly good machine.
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,75,"As directed by Renny Harlin (the director of Die Hard 2), Cliffhanger passes the principal tests of an action movie - it has truly awe-inspiring stunts and special effects and many of its suspense sequences will leave you with your heart in your mouth."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,75,"Cliffhanger offers us breathtaking mountain scenery, some occasionally gripping action sequences, and a lot of gags--mostly unintentional and mostly courtesy of Sylvester Stallone."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,67,"Despite the don't-look-down Olympian settings, Cliffhanger's spirit is brutal and earthbound."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"The dialogue is routine, frequently punctuated by cliches, and the character-building scenes do little more than waste time."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"On the other hand, the brutality and sadism it delivers at every opportunity, which we're supposed to take for granted as part of the ""fun,"" left me feeling that any civilization that can create such an entertainment may not deserve to survive."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"For all its technical sophistication, this movie is as blaring and unambiguous as a picture book for the very young."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,50,"He's slightly more articulate than usual, but the lines still fall from his lips like beaten boxers to the mat. Not that it much matters, given the constant mayhem."
Cliffhanger,6.4,84049211,40,"It's an eroticism of nastiness -- triple-X fare for dirty old men in raincoats. If you resist this sleazy gorefest, you'll be right to feel proud of yourself."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,100,"White House Down aims to be a low-brow slab of mindless summer fun. Most of the time, it comes pretty close to hitting the bull’s eye."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,80,"White House Down is still too gun-happy, and too long, but however you feel about the Oval Office, our country, or some of the movie's jingoism, young Emily is worth rescuing."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"Only in the last half-hour do the usual Emmerich absurdities pile up: I laughed outright at the character who, past 65 and diagnosed with a massive brain tumor that will kill him within months, cannot be stopped by a ferocious beating, being stabbed in the neck with a sharp implement, then being crushed against a wall by an SUV moving at a minimum of 30 mph."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"While White House Down isn’t going to score points for originality, seriousness, or subtlety (Emmerich likes his political messages blunt and loud), it is a lot of fun; if nothing else, Emmerich is a great widescreen showman who knows how to stage mayhem on a grand scale."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,You couldn’t ask for a more fun summer popcorn movie than White House Down.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"Of all the dumb megabudget ""Die Hard""–like action pictures of the last few years (including that other White House Goes Boom movie, ""Olympus Has Fallen""), this is both the most entertaining and the most inviting of viewers' input."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,What makes White House Down not just tolerable but frivolously entertaining is its slapstick soul; a scene where the presidential limousine does doughnuts on the South Lawn plays like an homage to the Keystone Kops.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"White House Down is a hoot and a half, a shameless popcorn entertainment that is preposterous and diverting in just about equal measure."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"An action thriller that doesn’t know when to quit. For the most part, though, it remains preposterously entertaining."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"Itself owing much to such lone-man-of-action hallmarks as “Die Hard” and “Speed,” this welcome throwback to an earlier, more generously entertaining era of summer blockbusters delivers a wide array of close-quarters combat and large-scale destruction, all grounded in an immensely appealing star turn by Channing Tatum and ace support from imperiled POTUS Jamie Foxx."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"White House Down is amply endowed with enough tension, humor, and calamitous action to ensure it a solid berth in the summer box-office sweepstakes. Channing Tatum comes into his own as a leading man in this picture, proving himself as a beefy yet agile action star and not just the pure beefcake of ""Magic Mike."""
White House Down,6.4,73103784,67,"Skip it, and you'll be depriving yourself of one of the summer's most satisfyingly stupid pleasures."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,67,"At best, White House Down is a sure-fire way to kill two hours, if not countless brain cells."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,65,"A buddy comedy disguised as a political thriller. It’s full of malarkey, but as a campaign of shock and awe, it’s hard to resist."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,"Intentionally or not, Roland Emmerich’s White House Down is the comedy hit of the summer. No other film equals its comic sophistication. Each nutty scenario is surpassed by the next, ludicrous story lines coalesce with expert orchestration, and absurd details return with perfect timing to build to a crescendo of hilarity."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,"While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios, the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,This bona-fide big-budget Hollywood flop at least has the good grace to laugh at itself as it rolls out the dingbat-daft action-movie cliches.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"The outcome may be pre-ordained, but Emmerich’s knack for a witty pop-culture reference, a pulse-pounding gun battle or a sneaky political undercurrent (the film has drawn fire in the US for being leftie propaganda) hasn’t deserted him."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,Lincoln meets Sudden Death: a corny but raucous throwback to when Planet Hollywood was hip. Gary Busey popping out of a rose bush wouldn’t feel out of place.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Longer than OHF and just as daft, WHD makes for a more entertaining watch before succumbing to the same bombastic overkill."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Even as the story accrues preposterousness, the action moves along crisply, and Tatum and Foxx hit a nice buddy-movie vibe."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"This is solidly a genre picture, and one that follows all the necessary conventions -- but it's also one that does it all very well. That means lots of big, dumb and loud action -- but it also means good, popcorny, summer fun."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"This piece of midsummer madness is undeniably silly and delusional, a dire political fable told as tongue-in-cheek pastiche."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"As demented and entertaining as promised, and a little less idiotic than feared."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Often, the hilarity is indisputably intentional. If you think you'll laugh and clap, try it; if you know you'll hate it, you're right."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Tatum muscles his way through the role with panache, while Foxx never gets a chance to break loose."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,58,"White House Down is nearly enough fun to be a bad movie that's a good time. But it always finds some way of being a drag, belching exposition and weak humor when action's all we need, then carrying the action to exhausting lengths."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,58,"White House Down is never more than a sliver away from gleeful self-parody. It’s pure patriotic kitsch, the cinematic equivalent of a black-velvet painting of a bald eagle clutching an American flag in its talons as it soars majestically over Mount Rushmore."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"The main flaw of White House Down is that it overstays its welcome, thanks in large part to a silly climax that seems to unfold in three laborious acts. At least, Tatum keeps his shirt off."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,It's probably not a good idea to examine the political content of a film in which the leader of the free world proves that the pen is mightier than the sword by stabbing someone in the neck with one.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"This sloppy mess also pales in comparison to the better-paced, taut ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" which represents 2013's better White House invasion story."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,Formula action films don’t come much more formulaic that this.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,This is getting old.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"White House Down is a corker, real competition for “Fast & Furious 6″ as the dumbest fun you’ll have at the movies this summer."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"Perhaps afraid that watching a symbol of liberty repeatedly go boom isn’t enough, Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt add family drama, an attack on Congress, a plane crash and the possible nuking of the Middle East. What isn’t tonally jarring ends up shatteringly inept."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,40,"White House Down never quite seems to decide what kind of movie it wants to be, although by firepower alone it qualifies as this summer’s most cartoonishly bombastic exercise in sensory overload (so far)."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,37,"The poster for this movie should read: Hello, Suckers!"
White House Down,6.4,73103784,30,"White House Down wants to riff on the stirring action crowd-pleasers of old. But instead of playing on those motifs, White House Down becomes a slave to them, turning into the very kind of rote, brainless, poorly choreographed and leaden action movie it wants to lighten up."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"Roland Emmerich makes love of country into a thing of unabashed hokum, which bleeds through every nook of this overstuffed jumble and leaves no character untouched."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"What played as rousingly dumb fun in ""Independence Day"" (1996) — all those pie-eyed nationalistic monologues, and U.S. landmarks reduced to rubble — now come off as callously insensitive, even with tongue firmly in cheek."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"[A] cartoonish, offensive, overblown, clanging, steaming piece of ... cinema."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,Baby Driver zooms onto the screen with an exhilarating combination of smarts and style.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"This is the song of the summer in movie form, a playful ode to car chases, Motown, diners, that moment when you find the exact tune that matches your mood, driving stick, crime capers, ’80s movies and love."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"It all works. All of it. The music, the performances, the twists and turns in the plot, the sheer energy and life force of the movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,[An] outrageously enjoyable petrolhead heist caper.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"Style is the substance of Edgar Wright's inventive heist flick, a fresh, masterful synching of music and getaway mayhem, as if La La Land's traffic jam was moving, armed and dangerous."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"As he proves yet again in his thrillingly syncopated heist movie Baby Driver, the 43-year-old U.K.-born Edgar Wright is just about the perfect 21st-century genre director. He has a fanboy’s scintillating palette — flesh-eating zombies, righteous vigilante cops, stoic bank robbers in sunglasses — without a fanboy’s lack of peripheral vision."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"An awe-inspiring piece of filmmaking from Edgar Wright that plays out as a musical through the lens of an action thriller. Sweet, funny and utterly original — you won’t see a film like it this year."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"The mechanisms at work in Baby Driver, while calibrated with hair’s-breadth precision, are nothing new. Here’s what is: the sheer glee with which the film prods around in its own clockwork to show you what spins what."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"No Hollywood suit and no diehard fan could have had the foresight to picture something like this, namely because nobody but Wright had any idea what this was supposed to be. This is something that’s been brewing inside his head for over two decades, and that unquestionable dedication, confidence, and passion fuels each and every scene of Baby Driver."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"With Wright in the driver’s seat, your standard getaway driver story is transformed into a giddy, adrenaline-filled joyride that’ll leave you gripping the edge of your seat and tapping your feet."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"Like Baby, Wright just wants to feel the music. He makes us feel it, too, one spectacular pleasure high after another."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"The director’s most ambitious work to date is a wildly successful romantic heist comedy, propelled from scene to scene with a lively soundtrack that elevates its slick chase scenes into a realm of musicality that develops its own satisfying beat."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,Sensationally entertaining.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Baby Driver is an almost perfect pastiche, a thoroughly enjoyable object. But sue me, I kind of miss the losers of the Cornetto Trilogy."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Wright has orchestrated every swerve and near smashup—and one glorious foot chase—with precision, a rarity in action filmmaking these days."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"It’s a seemingly straightforward “one last job” crime tale mashed up with a jukebox musical romance, part high-octane action flick and part music video, propelled by perfectly calibrated performances and a wicked sense of humor."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,This is movie craftsmanship and showmanship of a very high order.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Amid all the high-speed action, this “Baby” is also spiked with humor. In large part that's thanks to Spacey and Foxx, as well as Jon Hamm, who makes the bank robber Buddy, one of his better movie roles. Having such strong actors also brings a gravitas to the story."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Baby Driver, Wright’s first-ever solo screenplay, is a thrilling and original cinematic joyride that pays homage to heist masterpieces while creating a legacy of its own."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,89,"It’s that feeling of seeing something unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. It’s the experience of witnessing the fresh, the new. And if you love movies, there’s nothing like it."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Sometimes I just want a movie that kicks ass. And Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver delivers.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Baby Driver is the best time I’ve had at the movies in months, and, if the world is too much with you (as it is for many of us these days), you may feel the same. It’s a dazzling diversion, a series of cinematic highs that achieve the giddiness of not great art but great entertainment (and thus art through the back door)."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Now this is what I call a summer movie. Baby Driver has it all: thrills, laughs, sex, nonstop action, a killer soundtrack, a star-making performance from Ansel Elgort and a director – Edgar Wright – who can knock the wind out of you."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"It’s uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack’s beat."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Wright is savvy enough to realize that suspense and tension require characters that are more than human figures in a CGI playground. He does just enough with the men and women populating Baby Driver for us to get a sense of who they are.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Baby Driver feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It’s as much fun as you’re going to have in a movie theater this year."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Baby Driver literalizes Edgar Wright’s fascination with people’s emotional overreliance on pop culture as a cover for arrested development.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,85,"Even though the story isn't as impactful as its stylized packaging, Wright creates a delightful new film that is sure to satisfy his legions of fans."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,83,"Wright doesn’t simply apply technical precision and innovation to genre-smart storytelling — he also makes what must be exhausting work look like so much fun. And as a crime caper, heist movie, mob tale, puppy-love romance, jukebox-musical-of-sorts, Baby Driver is almost nothing but."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,83,"The concept of the car chase suffered in limbo for too long with inexperienced directors too often cutting corners instead of respecting why films like “The French Connection,” “Bullitt” and “Ronin” are still held in high regard today. Like all great students, Wright tips his hat to the teachers and refuses to phone in the camerawork on his stunts."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,82,"Best of all are the car chases, which Wright choreographs with the same blend of wit and technical finesse he brought to the pool-cue, “Don’t Stop Me Now” zombie rumble in Shaun of the Dead."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"The script is well-paced and packed with twists and turns that offers little in the way of respites to the beautiful mayhem. The characters, too, are wonderfully realised through the performances from the entire cast, each making a big impression no matter how long they're on screen."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"The result is a supercharged piece of fun unlike any motorized choreography since John Landis destroyed a fleet of cop cars in ""The Blues Brothers."""
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"A subtly innovative blend of cars, guns, music and old-school cool, it's also one of those increasingly rare creatures in Hollywood: an undeniably original movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"There’s much to enjoy in Baby Driver, including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique, qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"There’s a hint of artificiality to it. Maybe it’s an allegory, but the meaning hidden therein seems simply to be: go faster. Nothing wrong with that. It’s not as if Wright was shooting for something deeper and missed."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"Crime, romance, fast cars, hot tunes... slicker than your chrome hubcaps, Baby Driver is the summer’s coolest movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"Baby Driver is exhilarating, fantastically entertaining, and mildly frustrating, all at the same time."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"A crime-flick love story as Pop-conscious as Wright's earlier work but unironic about its romantic core, it will delight the director's fans but requires no film-geek certification."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"At its headiest, it’s like Singin’ in the Rain with a souped-up engine, but even if Baby is the Gene Kelly of the getaway car, watching Baby Driver always feels like watching someone else do the driving rather than being behind the wheel yourself."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Having hooked us with style, Wright knows he has to deliver on the story, and he does. His plotting is tight and fluid, wild and ultimately satisfying. It’s the ultimate cliche to compare a movie to a thrill ride, but sometimes the cliche applies."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"When all cylinders are pumping, Baby Driver is an enchanting experiment that puts the pedal to the metal. And even a few off notes can’t stop the beat of Wright’s fast and furious symphony."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"It's a thrill to watch it unfold, but the slick filmmaking combined with familiar tropes precludes most spontaneity."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Baby Driver is fast and furious and fun as hell, but its cinema of cool may melt down in the coming years, another artifact of reckless, headstrong youth."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"The movie is a little too postured.... Even Baby’s busy backstory threatens to make him a collection of quirky details. But all of that artifice is probably part of the point, best appreciated by generation Ear Bud and its preference for curated experiences."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Baby Driver doesn’t invite over-thinking. But as visceral, swaggering summer popcorn picture fun, it’s hard to beat. Impossible, as a matter of fact. Forget your comic books and sci-fi sequels. THIS is the movie of the summer."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Rarely do we see a filmmaker start so strong only to end with a whimper. All in all, though, Baby Driver is still worth seeking out, if only for that first hour. Inside those opening 60 minutes is the best action-comedy of the last ten years — full stop — featuring a breathtaking amalgamation of rip-roaring combat, a star-making performance by Ansel Elgort, and a string of clever bits."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"The good news is that, although Baby Driver is not much of a movie, it is an excellent music video — a club sandwich for the senses, lavishly layered with more than thirty songs."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Baby Driver’s superb set pieces and unpredictable song selections keep the story humming along, which is crucial since Wright’s plotting isn’t quite as deft."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Baby Driver proves why we should never doubt Edgar Wright's vision, because few filmmakers can back their ambition with such quality thrills."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Like all Edgar Wright movies, Baby Driver is a blast, featuring wall-to-wall music and a surfeit of inspired ideas. But it’s also something of a mess, blaring pop tunes of every sort as it lurches between rip-roaring car chases, colorful pre-caper banter, and a twee young-love subplot."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,69,"This movie is all about sensation, about grooving on the very specific but unquestionably catchy hook Wright has laid down for you."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,63,"As charming as Baby Driver strives to be, the appeal starts to curdle once Wright makes his fetishistic aims clear."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,80,"The Legend of Tarzan has a whole lot of fun, big-screen things going for it — adventure, romance, natural landscapes, digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome man-muscle. Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its old-fashioned escapades — it’s one long dash through the jungle by foot, train, boat and swinging vine — but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,80,"The Legend of Tarzan isn't half-bad; actually, it's pretty good. Beautifully made and smartly set at the beginning of Belgian King Leopold II's rapacious colonization of the Congo in the 1880s, this is certainly the best live-action Tarzan film in many a decade (which, admittedly, isn't saying much) and offers a well-judged balance of vigorous action and engaging-enough drama."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"Director David Yates, who did the last four “Harry Potter” films, delivers both big thrills at the climax and small, spooky ones when Tarzan and the others move through a world of beauty, terror and mystery."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"Unlike so many of the bloated, disappointing entries into the 2016 big budget sweepstakes, this is good escapist entertainment."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"You have to admire the sheer physical scope of this epic, even if there are no animals in it."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,68,"Waltz is the perfect villain in this setting: He's played this exact role before, as the smug, drawling, creepy aesthete who rarely stops smiling. But he's also capable of pivoting on a dime between real menace and garish, performative evil, between playing a subdued charmer, and the kind of movie-serial baddie who ties women to railroad tracks."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"As much as I enjoyed this bizarre, ambitious adventure and its careful popcorn kitsch, Tarzan’s story will always leave our ears ringing with something we hate, whether you choose Burroughs’s white-savior syndrome or Christoph Waltz’s shivery final speech: “The future belongs to me.”"
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"As it turns out, The Legend of Tarzan isn’t half-bad, and the film deftly put most of my fears to rest by creating animals and jungles that serve and enhance the story rather than detracting from it."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"You just wish — after two solid but oddly joyless hours — that Legend strained less to hit its marks, and swung a little more."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,63,"It's a heavy thematic load for a single movie to handle — especially this one, which nearly collapses from its burden. But it's hard to fault director David Yates, who captained the last four Harry Potter movies, for having ambition."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,63,"There’s always been something a bit ridiculous about the whole Tarzan premise, and while the talented cast and a solid director make for a serviceable and intermittently entertaining adventure, there’s very little about this film that screams, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,60,"The fights are quick and brutal and bloodless, with too much slo-mo and sped-up stuff, and some clever camera angles that get cut from before you can work out what you're looking at."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,60,"Skarsgård himself is fairly bland as Greystoke, delivering a po-faced Byronic spin on the character, all velvet coats and dreamy romantic stares at his belle while sitting barefooted in the boughs of trees. But at least the animals are memorable – best of all is a pack of scene-stopping silverback gorillas digitally created for the movie. This Tarzan isn’t quite the jungle VIP – but it’s got a little swing."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,58,It’s nice that The Legend Of Tarzan isn’t a nakedly mercenary franchise play that presumes dozens of sequels to come. (It’s also not a low-rent Casper Van Dien vehicle.) But it sure could use some money-grubbing set pieces to tie the genial silliness together.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The set pieces are fun, if not as spectacular as those in Jon Favreau's adaptation of Kipling's similar ""The Jungle Book."" And the plot moves at a nice pace."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"There’s also not much chemistry between Skarsgard and Robbie in a film that hints at the Greystokes’ great sex life but barely shows it. Instead, we get flashes of flesh that are hilariously dated in their obviousness."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"Its theme of white man as savior of black Africans is, to say the least, highly anachronistic in these days and times."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"While it looks great with its gorgeous computer-generated foliage and realistic animals, the story focuses too much on its stiff hero and a one-note villain rather than the big-picture ideas it raises in passing."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The Legend of Tarzan isn’t as singularly joyless as many of this summer’s other current offerings, but it also feels distinctly like a missed opportunity. Even when Skarsgård offers up the character’s famous jungle cry, it sounds more mournful than enthusiastic, and that sentiment seeps into the entire enterprise."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"For what it's worth, The Legend of Tarzan is several unpretentious cuts above the pompous, leaden ""Greystoke"" of over thirty years ago."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The result is a “Legend” that feels inoffensively modern, or at least less offensive than it could have been...But you can’t make a bold statement or exciting action picture when every frame is filled with fear — of offending someone, of upsetting animal rights activists, of giving the audience a Tarzan they won’t recognize, of failure."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,42,"Tarzan is too dull to offer consistent pulp excitement, too self-serious to let itself have fun, and too reliant on same-y CG spectacle to truly thrill."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,42,"Filmmakers simply can't make Tarzan like they used to. If someone tries, like director David Yates did with The Legend of Tarzan, he's just another superhero, swinging on vines rather than spider webs. Natives can't be restless. Lions won't be wrestled...Tarzan fans leave feeling Cheetah'd."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,Robbie lights up her scenes with the much more special effect of raw personality.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"The new Tarzan film, The Legend of Tarzan, plays as if a dog ate part of the script."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"As written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, The Legend of Tarzan alternates between a brazenly contemporary sensibility and quietly time-honored events. Unfortunately, almost all of the former are awkward while the latter still ring true."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"""Unfun"" isn't a real word, but boy, it sure describes The Legend of Tarzan."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"Not so much a ripping yarn, more of a dripping yarn, Yates’ reinterpretation of the Lord Of The Jungle is a big disappointment."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"Alexander Skarsgard is more abs than actor as the ape man, and Margot Robbie's Jane looks about as 19th-Century as an Aussie surfer girl. Together, they produce all the real-life passion of an Abercrombie & Fitch ad."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"The Legend of Tarzan ends up being a garbled, clunky production that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"As a brand, Burroughs’ hero has always been schlocky, and no amount of psychological depth or physical perfection can render him otherwise if the filmmakers can’t swing a convincing interaction between Tarzan and his animal allies. That dynamic — along with his full-throated yodel — has always been Tarzan’s trademark, but in this relatively lifeless incarnation, it simply doesn’t register."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,38,The film's action sequences are a jumble of movement and cuts that have no discernible relation to the actual motion of the characters.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,38,"It all might wash in a Johnny Weissmuller “Tarzan” movie from the 1940s. It no longer suffices today. Filmmakers, it’s time to pack up Greystoke Manor. Tarzan is dead."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,33,"I can respect the intent to craft The Legend of Tarzan as a new chapter for the hero, one which is aware of all the shortcomings of many Tarzan stories that have gone before. And yet the film minimizes its own best ideas and falls back on adventure film tropes, old and new, in a way that undermines its attempt to decontextualize Burroughs’ aging swinger."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,33,"Don’t be fooled by the lack of spandex: The Legend of Tarzan turns the Lord of the Apes into just another superhero, the newest movie about fiction’s greatest wild man memorable only for the dull irony of how housebroken it feels."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,30,"The Legend of Tarzan is too boring to be truly offensive. In spite of some impressive hand and brow acting, Skarsgard’s Tarzan is a frustrating blank and Margot Robbie’s Jane is a simple damsel in distress."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"Tarzan does little to adapt to modern times. Perhaps most punishingly of all for Skarsgard’s “True Blood” fans, it fails to ever put our hero in a skimpy loincloth."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"The Legend of Tarzan doles out big beats of action at regular intervals to keep you awake, like a drunkard clashing trashcan lids in an alley late at night. But your eyelids grow heavy anyway."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"In the end, what we have here is a Tarzan movie made by people who don’t understand the appeal of Tarzan. He’s about joy and abandon and the fantasy of living in harmony with creation. He’s not about the struggle in the Congo."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,20,"This ungainly and glum tale of the man famously known as Tarzan — who returns to the Congo, reconnecting with his past in the process — slavishly adheres to contemporary blockbuster convention, offering not a single spark of inspiration or real daring. A talented cast led by Alexander Skarsgård scowls through the film, held hostage by a solemn script and ghastly amounts of CG."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,10,"The Legend of Tarzan, for all its anticolonialist posturing and eminently attractive co-stars, has a dead soul."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,91,"Escape from Planet of the Apes is, in fact, a superior film in many ways to the first, but is lacking that film’s freshness and originality. Still: an undeniable high watermark for the franchise."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,91,"Escape From The Planet Of The Apes gets the series back on track, sending three apes back to the 20th century for a story that begins comically and ends in fear and loathing."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,90,"Escape from the Planet of the Apes is an excellent film, almost as good as the original Planet of the Apes. Arthur Jacobs’ production is marked by an outstanding script, using some of the original Pierre Boulle novel characters; excellent direction by Don Taylor; and superior performances from a cast headed by encoring Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,80,"Nobody is going to believe it, but I must say anyway that Don Taylor's Escape From the Planet of the Apes is one of the better new movies in town, and better in a genre—science-fiction—that at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,80,McDowell is as good as ever here – this time playing Cornelius – while Kim Hunter is hugely sympathetic as Zira.
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,60,"Former actor Don Taylor directs smoothly and efficiently and elicits fine performances from the cast, highlighted by the warm relationship between Zira, (a touching Kim Hunter) and Cornelius, knowingly played by Roddy McDowall, who returns in the role after being replaced in the first sequel because he was directing a movie (TAM-LIN) at the time."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,60,"With the potency of the central idea diminishing, Escape still manages the tricky move of carrying on a story that really should have ended with the last film, while setting up the series' mythology and paving the way for future chapters. But it's still a dilution."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,60,"The utterance of the three gentle chimpanzees in Escape from the Planet of the Apes tends to blow you out of the cinema seat, not so much because they can talk as because they all speak the same language."
Escape from the Planet of the Apes,6.3,12300000,40,It's a long way down from even the second in the series.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,100,"Transcendence is a bold, beautiful, sometimes confounding flight of futuristic speculation firmly rooted in the potential of today’s technology."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,70,An ambitious and provocative piece of work that is intriguingly balanced between being a warning and a celebration.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,70,"Transcendence is a dark, lurchingly entertaining pastiche of age-old worries, future-shock jolts, hot-button topics and old-fashioned genre thrills."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,67,"Moderately entertaining, periodically draggy, Transcendence is not as wacky-visionary as “The Matrix,” or nearly as lyrical as “Her.”"
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,67,"While never as dynamically involving as Christopher Nolan's ""Inception,"" for which longtime Nolan director of photography Pfister justifiably won an Oscar,  Transcendence still grapples with provocative existential concepts in similarly thoughtful terms."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,63,"Echoing the lessons learned from ""HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the message of Transcendence is that computers should not be allowed to become sentient."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,63,"Apart from Mychael Danna’s portentous orchestral and electronic score, Transcendence simply lacks oomph: Shots don’t overwhelm, scenes don’t pop and nothing on the screen gets under your skin."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,63,"The most galling thing about Transcendence, though, isn't its inability to get a handle on what, if anything, it wants to say about the enormous changes happening to the human race, it's the movie's ending, which seems calculated to reassure us that everything's going to be fine as long as the right people are in charge, especially if they're good looking."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,60,"A movie that’s of two minds. It’s well-grounded, but also over the top. It’s a man-vs.-machine epic and also an intimate drama. It’s quirky-smart yet sci-fi silly. And it winds up being half as good as it could be."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,58,A thoroughly mundane experience.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,Transcendence looks and sounds like a Christopher Nolan film that got attacked by malware.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Transcendence never quite succeeds at telling a story of scientific overreach. And it doesn’t really click as an action movie either. But as a human tragedy of man and monster, of beauty and beast, it has just enough genuine pathos that you wish it were better."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Watching it all unfold and slowly go off the rails, you can't help but wonder what Pfister's mentor, Nolan, might have done with the same material. My guess is he would have sent the script back for a Page One rewrite for starters."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Science fiction has an obligation to seduce the viewer into applying the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" With its plot holes and head-scratching incongruities, Transcendence fails in this arena thereby making the production as a whole feel bloated and unsatisfying."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"The story soon devolves into a far-fetched, futuristic snooze-fest that often defies its own logic. Characters' motivations are rarely clear, and allegiances shift with no explanation."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"There’s a lot of intelligence in Transcendence. Ironically, almost all of it feels artificial."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"An ambitious movie, but ultimately there’s too much “artificial” and not enough “intelligence.”"
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Transcendence is a movie without villains, thrills or, after Nolan fanboys show up, much of an audience."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"After an intriguing start, Transcendence — aka ""The Computer Wore Johnny Depp's Tennis Shoes"" — offers roughly the same level of excitement as listening to hold music during a call to tech support."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Clever ideas early on go rogue, or go missing, in the gallop toward an action-film climax that then, perversely, doesn’t materialize. The movie’s intelligence is artificial, its affect solemn."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Despite its looks, talent and pedigree, Transcendence never becomes the movie it could have been."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,"Pfister, who, like his mentor Nolan, adamantly continues to shoot on film (not digital), shows a sure hand at staging scenes, creating visuals and setting a tone -- if only all the diverse elements here fit comfortably under the same tent."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,50,Unquestionably the work of both a newbie director and a green screenwriter.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,42,"This humorless science-fiction cautionary tale feels like a relic from an earlier era, pulled out of a dusty old box of zip disks and 56k modems."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,42,"Wally Pfister, best known until now as the cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's big films, makes his directorial debut here, and as dumb as Paglen's script is, Pfister seems to have no feeling whatsoever for the staging of sequences or for any sort of dramatic narrative momentum."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,42,"While the core concepts of Transcendence and the questions they pose are inherently interesting, the manner in which the themes are explored feels extremely superficial."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence is nowhere near as elegant, witty, or insightful as ""Her."" Pfister and the screenwriter, Jack Paglen, grapple ponderously, sometimes oafishly, with the ethical and philosophical issues at stake in the film’s premise."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence, written by Jack Paglen, is just more business as usual, one of those ""control technology or it will control you"" sermons that nonetheless enlists the usual heap of technically advanced special effects."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence wants to use this future panic to comment meaningfully on our current interconnectedness and inorganic lifestyle, but it’s screaming too much to have that conversation."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"Transcendence suffers from terrible timing, arriving a few months after Spike Jonze charmed audiences with his semi-futuristic love story ""Her,"" which flipped a century’s worth of technophobia on its back."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"A bright idea, disappointingly dulled in the execution."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"While Transcendence has tons of money to spend on unpersuasive digital effects and dronelike music, it shows little interest in exploring the potentially tricky benefits of a computer-enhanced intellect; it’s not even in the enjoyable realm of starkly ridiculous Cold War thrillers like ""Colossus: The Forbin"" Project."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"You can feel this movie's attempts at Big Ideas about technology get weighed down by a dopey, nonsensical plot."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"There are intriguing, half-formed ideas afoot in Transcendence, but the script and Pfister’s heavy, humorless direction tend to reduce everything to simplistic standoffs between good and evil."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,40,"If you programmed an algorithm to figure out how The Lawnmower Man might be retold by Snake Plissken at the conclusion of Escape from L.A., you'd still wind up with a more recognizably human effort."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,38,"This thoughtful but windy and winded sci-fi thriller shortchanges the science – understandably - and the thrills. The directing debut of “Dark Knight” cinematographer Wally Pfister is a mopey affair with indifferent performances, heartless romance and dull action. It transcends nothing."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,38,The real trouble with Transcendence is that it just isn’t all that scary — at least not in the way that it wants to be.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,37,"Jack Paglen’s script casts artificial intelligence and its dangers as the central trouble for its ensemble cast, but Pfister chooses to explore it in essentially a two-hour “getting ready” montage."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,33,All I can cull is: don't mess with Mother Nature and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Fortune-cookie stuff. Erase All.
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"Transcendence is ""Her"" for dummies."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"Lethargic direction, bland visuals, credulity-straining plotting and tin-eared dialogue turn even pros like Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman into sleepwalking bores."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"A pointless nightmare of pretentious science fiction twaddle with no plot, no coherence and no heart."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,25,"Transcendence is the worst, most portentous, and certainly the silliest big-budget science fiction film since the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still."
Transcendence,6.3,23022309,20,"Ambitious to a fault, this cautionary fantasy about artificial intelligence has so much on its muddled mind, and so little sense of dramatic grounding, that it grows ever more preposterous before lurching to a climax that's utterly unfathomable."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,88,"What if Reagan’s America got a taste of her own interventionist foreign policies? Apocalypse, wow."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,75,"The film has some truly great right-wing anarchic moments, bur for the most part its politics are all too predictably – and only – militaristic, misogynist, racist, and xenophobic; for too much of its running time, it’s just a childishly simplistic masturbatory fantasy for right-wing hebephrenics that’s mostly safe enough to play the White House."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,75,"It packs plenty of rabble-rousing ammunition, but its sloppy execution is unlikely to win any merit badges for marksmanship."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,67,"As an action movie, Red Dawn is a repetitive headache, and anyone with Blue State sympathies will be appalled at its manipulations and exaggerations. But there's smart subtext beneath the big dumb explosions."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,Red Dawn is at once a mainstream shoot ‘em up action picture and an ideologically demented exercise in American paranoia.
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,"Director John Milius, the barbarian behind Conan, co-wrote this anti-gun-control, anti- Communist, survivalist script with Kevin Reynolds. Sick and silly as it is, the idea could have been intriguing, had it gone anywhere, which it didn't."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,"Another infantile right-wing fantasy from writer-director John Milius, this cinematic embodiment of the paranoid delusions of militarists, survivalists, and television evangelists is definitely a film for the Reagan era. Red Dawn is simply too
simplistic and inept to be taken seriously."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,80,"With few words and the odd squint, Cruise hard boils all of his charisma into a clenched fist, but is more than happy to let a dynamic Smulders take the lead in many scenes."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,80,"Overall, a superior sequel. Some people will never get over the height discrepancy but character-wise, Never Goes Back brings Reacher closer to the books for the type of thriller that rarely gets made these days."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"Somehow, Reacher gets under your skin with his mordant wit, razor-sharp intelligence, and existentialist intensity."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"This is a superior and assured action movie, a quality product that makes the case for a franchise."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"Cruise finds the core of Reacher in his eyes, with a haunted gaze that says this lone wolf is still on a mission and still a long way from home. That's the Reacher Lee Child created in his books. And Cruise does him proud."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"This Reacher outing has its imperfections and its obstacles to overcome, but the strength of the character and the briskness of the action make it acceptable if you are in the mood."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"With all the action movies that have come before, it's tough to make car chases and fist fights seem original and exciting, but fortunately, there's enough of a story to keep things interesting even when you might feel a sense of déjà vu."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"Never Go Back could have used a bit more personality in the bad guy department, and the middle section sags a bit before the inevitable (and satisfying) denouement. But everyone involved seems to understand exactly what kind of movie they’re trying to make, and they deliver on just about every promise made by the title Jack Reacher: Never Go Back."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,63,It all makes for competent but routine suspense.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,62,"It’s nothing special, but it’s nothing awful, either."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"It shouldn’t seem shocking, but the most interesting thing about this second Cruise-fired action film based on author Lee Child’s nomadic, ex-military hero is its action."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"If Zwick’s film improves on Christopher McQuarrie's inaugural, incoherent 2012 entry in the series, it's not through any special initiative on the film's part. But it's efficient, unfussy, and doesn't try to think any faster than it can run."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is always faintly diverting but never particularly engrossing, putting the venerable movie star through his paces without really asking much of him."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"There is no juicy high-concept baddie this time around, but there is a lot of enjoyable hokum and cheerful ridiculousness."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"The movie is lighter, more fun, and ultimately more satisfying than its weighty predecessor."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"There’s no mystery, and the action is thoroughly disposable, but what works this time around are the interactions between Reacher and Turner, mostly thanks to the efforts of Smulders, who brings an impassioned frustration to her character."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Tom Cruise may be an A-list action star, but the Jack Reacher films are beginning to feel like the B-movies of his career."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,The first scene in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back promises something interesting but delivers something considerably less. That’s a problem with the whole movie.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"The latest Reacher film is directed, with reasonable skill and no trace of personality, by Edward Zwick, based on a screenplay taken from the 18th novel. I wish I had more dynamic news to report, but contrary to Reacher's own violent tendencies, some things in life and the movies practically defy a strong reaction."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"When it works, it works. But if this character and this franchise are to survive, “Never Go Back” needs to be a promise Reacher makes — about ever playing a parent again."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a major step backward with an A-list actor in a C-grade military thriller.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"It’s a pity that Jack Reacher: Never Go Back fails to support Cruise and his co-stars, all of whom are acting as if their lives depended on it. There’s a great movie buried somewhere in here—a strange but beguiling family comedy and a meditation on nature vs. nurture, with a bit of shooting and punching thrown in—but the filmmakers never figure out how to excavate it."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"It’s two solid hours of disposable, forgettable action-thriller filmmaking with a competent Cruise performance in the middle."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Like its predecessor it’s an unremarkable placeholder until the next ""Mission: Impossible"" flick comes along."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"With anybody other than a superstar like Tom Cruise in the title role, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back would just be a routine potboiler. With superstar Tom Cruise in the title role, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is … a routine potboiler."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Tom Cruise is as muscly and bland as heroes come, restrained by the burden of two dead-weight companion pawns. Jack Reacher is a man who thrives on working alone, and this dull tale of backstabbing militant leeches proves that fact tenfold."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is harmlessly generic.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back isn’t a throwaway, and mainstream action/thriller fans should come out more than satisfied at the visceral nature of the film. But anyone hoping for more than a superficial on-the-run chase movie will probably wish Reacher had stayed home, instead of going back."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,"Cruise’s undeniable star power is all that keeps “Never Go Back” from feeling like it came off a studio assembly line, though you’ll still spend most of the movie wondering if you’ve been swindled into watching a movie about Ethan Hunt’s luddite twin brother."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"As a thriller, it’s lethargically paced, uninspiringly edited, and hardly raises your pulse even during life-or-death mano-a-mano."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"The result is a well-executed but stubbornly formulaic crime thriller that telegraphs most of its major surprises long before they ever happen. It's not a bad movie, mind you. It's just one that will strike viewers as exceedingly familiar, and as generic as that say-nothing title."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the second movie that Tom Cruise has starred in as this title character. Let’s hope it’s the last.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Never Go Back is boilerplate action-thriller, filmed with an anonymous style and scripted so that characters talk in catchphrases."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Sometimes the film’s frenetic pace works, as in a brutally efficient half-second fight in an airplane bathroom. But more often, it feels like cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Billy Weber are feuding."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"By-the-numbers plotting, seen-it-all-before action moves, banal locations and a largely anonymous cast alongside the star give this a low-rent feel."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Zwick barely manages to tickle our adrenaline, waiting till the climactic showdown amid a New Orleans Halloween parade to deliver a sequence that could legitimately register as memorable."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"But hey, at least Zwick and company carve out some time for Tom Cruise to run, with Reacher dashing across a busy avenue for about 18 seconds or so. It’ll make for a great supercut one day."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"Unfortunately, as with too many films being made with the international market in mind, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a jumble of overhyped action scenes, trite dialogue, painfully bad “character development”, and awful writing."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,The whole thing is just so sloppy and dumb and overflowing with clichés.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"You cannot always judge movies by their titles, but you sometimes get good advice. The sequel Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, supplies its own five-word review."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"The visual blandness of Edward Zwick’s style and the simplistic, easily solved case is better suited for television."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,25,"Of course, action movies don’t have to be believable or poignant. They just have to get your adrenaline pumping. But the movie lacks inspiration in that department, too, owing to action sequences you’ve seen before, familiar music and dialogue so predictable you could make a game out of guessing the next line."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,25,"Even as a star text, it’s shoddy."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,83,"Snitch is grittily streetwise, and until its last 20 minutes fairly credible compared to other movies ""inspired by"" true stories."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"Despite its apparent compromises to noble finger-wagging (initially) and requisite fist-pumping (eventually), Waugh has fashioned a sturdy character-first entertainment out of Snitch at a time of year when those are all too rare to behold."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"Pleasant because, instead of the usual hero-and-mayhem jive, Snitch is an honest exercise in workmanlike craft. This is to film what ceramic is to floors or Billy is to bookcase or what a third-line centre is to a winning hockey team – hardly great but good and solid and functional."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"In its focus on an ordinary family facing a nightmarish scenario, Snitch is a terrifying but relatable story."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,75,"It's an entertaining picture — pulp, coming from a place of righteous indignation."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,70,"There’s a lot of cartoonish potential in Snitch, but director Ric Roman Waugh (who previously made the excellent prison drama ""Felon,"" another exercise in somber desperation) seems intent on trying to sell the movie as a more serious enterprise. And amazingly, the gambit works."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,70,"Unusual for this sort of thing, Snitch is a film after which you remember the characters and actors more than the big action moments."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,67,Snitch toys with moral ambiguity and fatalism before losing its nerve and delivering the action-movie goods in a climax that hews closer to fantasy than the keenly observed realism of the film’s solid center.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"Snitch is protein-and-starch filmmaking at its utilitarian -- and belly-filling -- best. Johnson brings the steak; Bernthal the sizzle. The father-son drama is served up as sauce on the side. But as long as the beef isn’t too overcooked, who needs the A1?"
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"Snitch gets a decent amount of drama (and action, of course) out of the argument that there’s paying for a crime, and then there’s overpaying."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"Directed by veteran stuntman Ric Roman Waugh, Snitch is shot with a mix of nervous close-ups and weirdly vertiginous angles."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,Who would have guessed Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson would deliver the best work of his career playing a guy who squares off against a pack of small-time street thugs.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,63,"What gives it’s juice is the supporting cast. John Bernthal (“The Walking Dead”) is credibly wary as the ex-con John begs to get him in the door of the drug world. And the terrific Michael Kenneth Williams is the first dealer he meets, a guy who pulls a gun on him just to test him."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,"While not the balls-out action movie the marketing suggests, this Rock-powered family drama is not with its moments."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,"Snitch is a movie that cries out for the wiry B stars of yore: Robert Forster, a younger Tommy Lee Jones. And it would have occurred to a craftier screenwriter to make his hero’s walk on the criminal wild side a touch more tempting."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,Although Johnson performs admirably in the drama-heavy role — far better than many of his action-hero colleagues would manage — John Matthews is a character as boring as his name.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,60,"It's nice to have actors of Sarandon and Pepper's caliber onboard for the office-bound wheeler-dealer scenes, but mostly, it's the prospect of witnessing Johnson at the helm of an 18-wheeler as he rams his way through machine-gun fire that excites."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,55,Whatever lizard-brain fun might have been had in watching Johnson do battle against a drug cartel is weakened by the occasional hard tug at the social conscience. The film winds up divided against itself.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"Not the usual action movie. It's too odd for that. Based on a true story, it has the weirdness of real life, which is good. But also like real life, it has that funny way of not making much sense or being all that enjoyable."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,A glorified TV movie.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"For all its violence and road rage, Snitch doesn’t disintegrate into noisy popcorn nonsense."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"Someone please get director Ric Roman Waugh a tripod! Snitch might be a passable action-thriller but it's hard to say because every time an action scene comes along, the image shakes so badly it's impossible to keep anything in view or focus."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,The verdict on Snitch is that Johnson has attempted a career detour on a street marked Do Not Enter.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,50,"Unfortunately, Snitch is torn between being an ideological drama and a more traditional action film – and Johnson’s presence only contributes to the confusion."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,42,"The film tries to paint in shades of gray with vague criticisms of the war on drugs, but the absurdity of its he-man Everyman plot ends up turning its moral palette a muddy brown."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,Neither clever nor stupid enough to work.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,Good intentions are all but submerged in nonsense.
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,"This is the sort of movie that Charles Bronson would have made back in the day, and indeed a shot of Johnson standing in a sporting goods store, contemplating a wall of shotguns as he gets ready to get busy, could have come from any ""Death Wish."""
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,"All the talking would be fine, but the dialogue is preachy, the drama too earnest and the action kind of sluggish, though it's hard not to get a jolt when Johnson jumps behind the wheel."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,40,"Snitch is like watching an elephant on ice: inelegant, but you admire the effort."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,30,"Snitch wasn’t going to be good no matter what Johnson did; it is so poorly directed that even Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, playing a shrewish federal prosecutor, comes off as a hack straight off a soap opera."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,30,"Though Snitch loudly announces itself as a social-issues movie, its nominal outrage over the severity of our nation's sentencing laws for first-time drug offenders is quickly subsumed by a jacked-up narrative of a father going to extremes to save his son."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,25,"Snitch is just a big, dumb, ugly-looking waste of time, one that turns one of cinema's most charismatic heroes into a restless drone. As they say in the joint: snitches get stitches. But Snitch deserves to be put down for good."
Snitch,6.5,42930462,25,Snitch is the latest in a long line of films whose sole purpose is to flatten a major social problem into a pulp ideal for self-serious spectacle.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,88,Snow White and the Huntsman reinvents the legendary story in a film of astonishing beauty and imagination.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,80,"I resisted this derivative mishmash of classic fairytale and modern epic fantasy for as long as I could, but ultimately it swept me up into its geeky but manly embrace and carried me away on a white charger."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,78,"Ambitious, brutish, ruthlessly unromantic – has the right idea casting its heroine as a Joan of Arc-type crusader and its evil queen a dissertation (albeit first draft) on beauty as the most direct path to power for the disenfranchised female."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"Attempts to inject a little humor via the antics of the dwarves don't work, especially since one of the little people is killed early in the proceedings. No one's going to be singing ""Hi ho! Hi ho! It's off to work we go!"" after that happens."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"Yes, there are many splendid reasons to see Snow White and the Huntsman – enough, maybe, not to care that neither Snow White nor the Huntsman rank high among them."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"A surprisingly fine, fantastic movie it is."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"This is a violent film. It's rougher, in fact, than ""The Hunger Games."""
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,It is an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love - its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"An evil spell nearly does Snow White in, but it's lifted in the nick of time. The strangest spell afflicts Kristen Stewart; she can't seem to imbue Snow White with anything more than a semblance of feeling. That spell never lifts, but it doesn't make much difference in the end because the forces of good manage to work around it."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Though it is an ambitious - at times mesmerizing - application of the latest cinematic technology, the movie tries to recapture some of the menace of the stories that used to be told to scare children rather than console them."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Rare among the recent fairy tale adaptions (from ""Mirror Mirror"" to the dreadful ""Red Riding Hood"") the invigorating Snow White and the Huntsman actually breathes new life into an old story."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Never quite delivers on its promise -- a dark retelling of the fairy tale in which women hold the true power, good and evil -- but it certainly is an attractive misfire."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,The movie's revisionist tone is startlingly enough to carry you along.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,67,"If you've a mind to see a classic fairy tale rendered as an action movie, and if you want to see a sizeable handful of fine English actors have grand fun playing grizzled dwarves, there are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of Snow White and the Huntsman."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,"The nearly two preceding hours often feel like three, as the patchwork script keeps introducing characters and subplots and dropping them, all while rushing characters through eye-popping environments."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,One of those movies that makes for a fantastic trailer. Much beyond that can feel like repeat viewing.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,Snow White and the Huntsman is definitely a missed opportunity. Sanders was on to something in taking the Snow White tale to its most menacing extreme.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,Just feels like it was made from the pieces of every fantasy-action movie ever made.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"The CGI effects are so slick that they undercut the movie's shock value, and the action moves too quickly to instill a real sense of fear, but this is still visually impressive, with spectacular make-up, costumes, and cinematography."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"It's Theron who owns this film, imbuing her deliciously depraved Queen with furious pain and deep-seated fear."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"Why can't heroines just be heroines anymore, instead of micromanaged personalities who may as well have the words ""Role Model"" tattooed across their foreheads?"
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"It's hard to imagine who will thrill to this violent, gorgeous, and empty film."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"The rousing speeches and booming battle scenes are all well done as far as blockbuster spectacle goes, but you can't help but feel the filmmakers' resistance to the story's grimmer undercurrents."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"A strong visual style tussles with flaccid storytelling in this ambitious retelling of Grimm. It won't exactly have Walt Disney spinning in his secret ice chamber, but you may wish they spent more time worrying about what exactly the film is than who it's for."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"A visually inventive, deliciously dark fairytale reheat. The story's far from the stuff of legend, but Theron makes for a ferocious meanie, helping to flush away ""Mirror Mirror's"" sugary aftertaste."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,58,"Some of the fairy tale effects are marvelous; but the odyssey from darkness to light is unduly long and sloggy, and Stewart, with her contemporary edge, seems to be acting in the wrong era."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,58,A tastefully overbearing franchise fairy tale with a handful of ravishing touches.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"I spent several minutes not caring what was happening with the story but just observing the patchwork illusion of oversized props, short stunt doubles and computer grafting of big faces on small bodies. Nice work."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,A bold rethinking of a familiar old story and striking design elements are undercut by a draggy midsection and undeveloped characters in Snow White and the Huntsman.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"Handsome but hollow, Snow White & the Huntsman is easily among the stranger additions to a roster of rebooted fairy tales."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"As feminist fantasy, the film is non-committal, and as a reimagining of the fairy tale, it's at best expensive-looking without seeming wantonly so."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"For all this Snow White's visual ornamentation, there's no sense of narrative priority - the filmmakers can't see the Dark Forest for the trees."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,45,"What dooms Snow White and the Huntsman is ultimately not how over the top it is, but how dull it is."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,42,"There are complicated elements at work here, with threads of curdled vengeance, victim entitlement, and insanity bound together in ways it would take a much smarter film to unravel. Snow White And The Huntsman doesn't try, and the film just keeps getting dumber as it goes along."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,40,The result is tangled and overblown.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,38,"In Snow White and the Huntsman, this talented but woefully miscast actress (Stewart) is expected to rally an entire army of soldiers, even though she usually looks like she forgot the combination to her locker."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,30,"Snow White and the Huntsman, the first feature from British commercial director Rupert Sanders, has its work cut out for it if it wants to be a truly dull piece of junk - but it manages."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,25,"Suffers from a problem in its rhythm. It's not that its pace is too slow, but that it's too regular, and this lack of syncopation makes it feel slow."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,25,"Overlong, overcrowded, overstimulating and with an over-the-top performance by Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna, the movie is a virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,88,"The best movie Steven Seagal never made. Except that Statham, while just as marked for death, is harder to kill."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,83,Immensely exciting and funny.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,80,A poke in the adrenal gland -- obeys the first law of action movie-making by quickening the heart and dazzling the eye.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,80,A thoroughly satisfying mix of mayhem and mindless fun.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,75,"Kinetic, meaningless and fun."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,75,"There's plenty to like here, especially for connoisseurs of the action genre, and there's also plenty to make you wonder whether Besson and co-writer Robert Mark Kamen scribbled their screenplay on a batch of Marseilles cocktail napkins and then lost one or two."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,70,This is a film where there isn't the slightest doubt about the dramatic outcome. But the marketing will be a cliffhanger.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"Cut above this genre's usual industrial sludge, even when the chops and kicks are too fast to follow."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"Too much action brings the movie to a dead standstill. Why don't directors understand that? Why don't they know that wall-to-wall action makes a movie less interesting -- less like drama, more like a repetitive video game?"
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"This balls-to-the-walls action/adventure makes the average James Bond film look like something by Eric Rohmer. It’s high rent Steven Segal - fights, explosions, and more fights, but with a flair."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,63,"The plot doesn't rate as high as the quality of the bodies in fast, furious motion. What counts in The Transporter isn't the wafer-thin story about smugglers -- it's the way Martin kicks open a door, fends off a couple of axes and uses a perfectly ordinary sport shirt as a weapon."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,60,Entertaining but forgettable action flick.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,60,"What's most disappointing is the almost utter lack of humor --  In the mindless action sweepstakes, however, there's still enough here to place The Transporter above big-bang gibberish like XXX."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,60,Will Statham make it as an action hero? Hard to say. His personality makes Vin Diesel look positively debonair.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,58,"A slick, sexy little package with fast cars, big explosions, dazzling locations in the south of France, a trip-hop score, and about as much plot to fill a thimble."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Sadly, the last 40-odd minutes are essentially one fight, pushed to the point of absurdity."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Sreams its devotion to style over substance with slick action sequences, fast cars and breathtaking stunts."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Another big, dumb action movie in the vein of ""XXX,"" The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"Muddles through as a film so uninterested in character, it doesn't bother assigning names to them."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,50,"If anything, The Transporter isn't ludicrous enough; only one scene (a hand-to-hand showdown in the middle of an oil slick) reaches the inspired, delirious comic heights of the best Hong Kong movies."
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,40,So second-hand and disposable is it in every respect.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,40,American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,40,It's like the worst movie Jean-Claude Van Damme never made.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,33,It takes perverse genius to make an action film this stupid.
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,20,"Kills time between car chases and martial-arts bouts with random scuba-diving footage apparently culled from producer–co-writer Luc Besson's ""The Big Blue."""
The Transporter,6.8,25296447,20,"That the movie becomes silly isn't necessarily a problem, but it also becomes tiresome, degenerating into a series of martial arts interludes -- everyone unaccountably leaves his guns at home."
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,67,"Sharp-eyed viewers will spot director Corman, Martin Scorsese, Sylvester Stallone, Joe Dante, and Paul Bartel in bit parts while Mary Woronov takes an incredibly long time to maneuver her van through a multi-car pileup. Sure, it's a ripoff. Sure it's brainless. Cannonball is still a definitive drive-in car chase flick that's gonna make you want to tromp the gas pedal and burn rubber on the way home."
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,40,Far from Bartel's best exploitation work but worth a look for low-budget cult fanatics.
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,40,"Cannonball lacks its predecessor's dramatic tension, and by the middle of the film Bartel's disregard for narrative in favour of a series of jokes leaves no dramatic resolution."
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,30,Cannoball will please those who won’t rest until they see every car in creation destroyed and aflame.
Cannonball!,5.5,3270000,25,"It tries for the greatest realism in its obligatory shots of gas tanks exploding, and yet includes such absurdities as a local news helicopter that tracks all of the competitors all the way from LA to New York. To be sure, without the traffic copter the story would have been impossible to follow - but then why follow the story anyway? In the meantime, can we possibly hold our breath for ""Gumball Rally?"" I'll bet I can."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"This is the kind of pure entertainment that, in its fullness and generosity, feels almost classic."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"May show both director and star working at their professional peaks, but I don't think it's as good as that underappreciated masterwork ""A.I."" It's not as resonant and daring, not as full of magic and marvel. Spielberg stretches himself technically here but not emotionally."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,A heart-pounding experience that makes you think and contains a gallery of characters that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"It affirms that, even in the 2000s, movies do not have to be brain-dead to be exciting. When the season is over, Minority Report will more than likely stand out as the best picture to grace multiplex screens during the Summer of 2002."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"This film is such a virtuoso high-wire act, daring so much, achieving it with such grace and skill. Minority Report reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"Stripped of all bravado, Cruise delivers a raw and probably detractor-proof performance. Spielberg does what he did right in creating a novel milieu for ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"" but this time the writing is fresher and anything but unwieldy."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,91,"A happy surprise: a timely antidote to the comic-book mindlessness of ""Spider-Man"" and repetitive space fantasy of ""Star Wars,"" and an encouraging bid from the top of the A-list to once again reach very high and spit in the face of the gutless formula filmmaking that rules Hollywood."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,Few directors are capable of marrying ideas and entertainmentone is often sacrificed for the otherbut Spielberg peppers one gripping action setpiece after another with trenchant details about a near-future robbed of the most basic freedoms and privacy.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,It's a dark and dazzling spectacle.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"Where Minority Report succeeds is by dishing up a little bit of everything  to see no one leaves the theater disgruntled. There are helpings of science fiction marvel, theres some interminable tension and a real human story underneath it all. The specials effects are damn impressive to boot."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"Terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi, incomparably better than ""A.I."" and as dark a movie as the director has made since ""Schindler's List."""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"This is a fiendishly complicated whodunit -- or, to be more precise, a who-done-what-to-whom-and-when -- told within the confines of thoughtful, speculative science-fiction."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,The film moves swiftly and unerringly to its conclusion. Spielberg remains under Stanley Kubrick's directorial spell.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"The most compelling question dangling at its end is, ""Didn't Steven Spielberg used to know how to bring a movie to an end?"""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,88,"Spielberg takes assured control. In his hands, Minority Report is a classy, chilly quasi-Hitchcockian affair."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,88,"The first 20 minutes are masterful, as Cruise hunts down a killer-to-be; the last 20 are mediocre, as screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen untangle the mystery they've grafted onto Dick's story. In between lies a conventional but expertly realized cop-on-the-run drama."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,83,"Spielberg's dark side may not be where everyone wants to live, but it's somehow encouraging to know that he has one."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"May be a shade too serious and contemplative to completely enchant the thrill-seeking masses, while simultaneously seeming too mainstream-minded and genre-bound to be entirely embraced by highbrows."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"It's not the crowning achievement in Steven Spielberg's oeuvre, but Minority Report stands on its own sturdy sci-fi legs, and there's no sign of that little imp Haley Joel Osment, to boot, thankfully."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"Taut entertainment that juggles brainy ideas about perception, predetermination and free will - and drops things in a messy third act where the vintage noir gets bathed in a bit too much Spielbergian glow."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"Cruise will never be a master thespian, but there's no one better at putting across the charisma of control, and the opening sequence of ''Report'' is an astonishingly fluid demonstration of his gifts."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,78,"Its most vivid scenes -- a visit with an insane ophthalmologist, a showdown at Anderton's supposed crime scene -- have the kind of anything-goes creativity that set ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" apart from the crowd last year."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"The mechanical beauty and android possibilities of the future excite the filmmaker, and that's where Minority Report becomes an alluring postcard from the edge. But it's an edge over which Spielberg never seems to want to step."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"Whose idea was it to turn Minority Report into a mushy declaration of humanism? It ends up as less of a warning about an Orwellian police state than a protest that Pre-Cogs are people, too. It's Dick-less."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"Though he can still deliver an amazing scare, Mr. Spielberg's interest now leans more toward exposition rather than the anticipatory. He is explaining the fun away."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,One of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"It's not the kind of work that wins awards, but without Cruise's intensity almost willing our interest in Spielberg's unrelentingly dark world, Minority Report wouldn't have nearly as much life as it does."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,More humdrum than horrible. It isn't futuristic film noir; it's just everyday film beige.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"We'll never know what might have been, as eye candy and food for thought replace real thrills in the cool but cold Minority Report."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"Miscast, misguided, and often nonsensical, Minority Report is nevertheless the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since ""Jurassic Park."""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"Give Steven Spielberg some dinosaurs or a cute, funny alien and he'll spin populist sci-fi till the Arcturan cows come home. Give him a philosophical story about technology changing what it means to live in this world and he'll craft a hodgepodge of shallow and unexplored ideas."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,80,"Sound silly? It is. Very. But it's also highly enjoyable, incredibly slick and a damn sight more entertaining than numerous other bombastic actioners. Bogosian makes for a splendidly deranged villain."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,80,This is Seagal's best movie since Out for Justice.
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"I mention all of these tiny logical quibbles because I was amused by them. I was also amused by the film. It isn't as good as the original ""Under Siege,"" but it moves quickly, has great stunts and special effects, and is a lot of fun."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"Seagal is a solid, whispering presence, but he is particularly well served by a special-effects team that provides him with one exciting visual adventure after another. Along with ""Species,"" this is a perfect summer action film experience."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,A solidly enjoyable formula thriller.
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"This sequel is much better than the original ""Under Siege""...The real coup here is the discovery that when you eliminate dialogue, and thus eliminate Seagal's efforts to act in that rather high voice of his, the movie takes on a surprising gravity. When Seagal doesn't talk, he verges on the dignified. It's kind of scary."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,75,"Under Siege 2 isn't going to convince anyone that Seagal is Brando, though he often sounds a bit like him. But, taken strictly as an action sequel, the film is a lively show. It's a formula follow-up with formula dialogue and formula action but the director, Geoff Murphy, does extremely well within the sequel's narrow limits."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,70,It's fists and feet that do the talking in Under Siege 2 and they prove eloquent enough.
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,70,"Bogosian provides some much-needed comic relief to the slogging tale. He turns in solid work, as does Everett McGill as his head strongman, but they and others are saddled with pedestrian dialogue and motivation."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,63,"We'll bet you our measly paycheck that UNDER SIEGE 3 is set on an airplane -- although, given the precipitous downward trajectory of Seagal's career, a moped or a pair of in-line skates isn't out of the question."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,"Although Under Siege 2 isn't credible for a single moment, its director, Geoff Murphy, has done a smoothly efficient job of coordinating the action sequences."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,"Murphy, who started directing movies in his native Australia, does a good job of locomoting Under Siege 2 at a lively, muscular clip."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,"I have come to the conclusion that it's impossible for a Steven Segal movie to be anything better than mediocre, and this particular travesty may be his worst yet. The title Under Siege is supposed to represent the situation faced by Segal's character, but it's equally appropriate in describing the experience of the poor viewer who sits through this film."
Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,5.5,50024083,50,It is so bad and illogical that even devoted loyalists should find their faith tested. The subtitle Dark Territory doesn't even begin to describe how inchoate and blemished this storytelling is.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is everything we go to the movies for, as Gunn is able to build an intricate intergalactic world full of multiple races, lush scenery, and maximum escapism through action, romance, comedy, and interstellar drama."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Surrender, earthlings. It’s the Guardians’ world and you’ll be happy to live in it."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"It manages the trick of being both an unironic sci-fi action-adventure flick and a zippy parody of one. It’s exciting, funny, self-aware, beautiful to watch and even, for a flickering instant or two, almost touching."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is the most charming Marvel movie so far. The primary ensemble (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel) is perhaps the most winning group of characters they've introduced in any of these movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,Director James Gunn’s first foray into big-budget movie making succeeds despite focusing on characters largely unknown to mainstream audiences and provides some of the most genuinely affecting moments of any Marvel film to date.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,A perfectly irreverent counterpoint to movies that take their superheroes a bit too seriously.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,The film's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,[A] blend of classic sci-fi fare and current pop-culture irony is what rockets “Guardians” into the stratosphere.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,90,"Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy ""Guardians"" is irreverent in a way that can bring the first ""Star Wars"" to mind."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,90,"It's easy to get carried away with movies like this, which lend themselves to fanboy hype. It's not a perfect movie. But it is one that is hugely enjoyable, bears repeated viewings and will be as funny in 10 years (or 50) as it is now. And that's pretty swell."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,89,Marvel’s rambunctious entry into the space opera genre—and the cornerstone of its “Cosmic Marvel” roster of characters and storylines—so perfectly embodies what the preceding months of hype and hope foretold that even its weak points (and it has its share) feel almost like unavoidable imperfections—broken eggs for a pretty satisfying omelet.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"""Guardians” stands apart because it’s somehow truer to a comic book’s essence than any Marvel or DC-derived picture you can name. Which is to say it’s pulpy, kind of cheesy and giddily exaggerated (and aware of it) in a way that, say, the “Thors,” the “Captain Americas” and Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are not."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. It's insanely, shamelessly silly – just one reason to love it."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"Gunn makes this huge entertainment accessible to the converted and the neophyte alike, and he has only has one goal: To send you out of the theater with a fat smile on your face. Mission accomplished."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"It’s filled with a kind of giddy energy that leaps off the screen. It’s corny, it’s dopey, it’s sincere, it’s romantic, it’s thrilling and it leaves one anticipating the next adventure of these heroic goofballs."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,83,"Gunn’s careful to keep the focus on the central five, but certainly proves himself capable of the bigger canvas. The film really pops visually, with an admirably bright color palette (DP Ben Davis doing excellent work), and though there are occasionally some geography issues, the action is mostly satisfying."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"The film, directed and co-written by James Gunn, is joyfully irreverent. Gunn lends his underachiever superheroes a geeky, comic camaraderie, and he brings a spry touch to the wacky intergalactic adventure."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"It is fast, it is fun."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"To see an expensive, big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence, it’s also fair to call it a marvel."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Gunn, a B-movie enthusiast who got his start at Troma, has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"As much as Guardians largely thrives through its lovably scuzzy style, it cannot avoid the immense tractor-beam pull of The Big Marvel Studios Final Act."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Overall this is giddy, ridiculous fun, a witty, wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a film."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Mad, marvellous and all kinds of sci-fi magical, Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel’s riskiest but most surprising success yet."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Guardians of the Galaxy is undoubtedly a flashy space opera, but if you are on board with that, it's a resounding success that takes a seat at Marvel's top table and suggests there could still be life after The Avengers."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"The fun of it – and Guardians of the Galaxy specialises in fun, served by the sugar-sprinkled ice-cream-scoopload – is in seeing this odd quintet bluster through space battles and alien brawls that would have defeated anyone smarter and better-equipped. Just as the team makes do with the junk they find around them, the film feels like a mound of gems culled from decades of pop-culture scavenging."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Overall, the writers have crafted a well-articulated universe with distinct settings and relatable, compelling characters devoted to a thrilling quest for redemption."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,78,"Guardians of the Galaxy is an outlier: a space opera in a largely earthbound movie cycle (excepting the occasional red-eye to another dimension in the Thor pictures), candy-colored and bopping where the other Marvel movies are muted and imposing, and the funniest one to date, without a doubt."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"What works best in Guardians is, in fact, the camaraderie of the team itself and the heart applied to their slowly gelling sense of family."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The gadgetry and fight scenes are nicely rendered. The aeronautical battles, though, fall well short of state-of-the-art. Maybe they're collateral damage to the film's goofy style."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Too loud, too long and too busy but – here’s the good part – also wonderfully silly."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The film’s fast, amusing, good-looking and not overlong, which is all sensible non-geeks ask of such movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"With its introduction of wonderfully memorable characters and blend of humor, action and catchy tunes, Guardians is perfectly pitched escapist fun."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"A fun and relatively fresh space Western. Think “Firefly” pitched at 15-year-olds, with a lot of overt ""Star Wars"" nods. And super-“irreverent” dialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The motley crew’s repartee makes for comedy that’s surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,The film owes its relative buoyancy above all to Chris Pratt as the wisecracking space rogue at the helm.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Guardians of the Galaxy is fun but forgettable, or perhaps Gunn crams so much onto the screen that memory is crowded out. Definitely worth a second look, just to figure out what in the name of Buckaroo Banzai is going on."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The vibe, if not the specifics, is highly reminiscent of ""The Last Starfighter,"" ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" and others. The fact that the movie's ""present"" is defined as being 1988 and the soundtrack is peppered with '70s tunes cements the retro feeling."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Guardians boasts not one, but two Han Solo proxies — not to mention an ass-kicking Princess Leia surrogate, a villain with a very Sithian fashion sense, and the flora answer to Chewbacca. Also, one of the Han Solo types is a talking raccoon."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Laugh-out-loud funny and production-designed to death, Guardians of the Galaxy pops off the screen."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Though the special effects win the day, Guardians of the Galaxy holds court with a sense of humor that transcends its more familiar ingredients."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"The film’s scruffy, smartass band of brothers, along with Gunn’s light directorial touch, make for an invigorating breather after too many summer weekends of hammer-wielding superheroic solemnity."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself — because it seems capable of being so much more."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"A likable lightweight, though it's heavy enough on cosmic combat and dazzling effects."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"It’s a high-spirited, swashbuckling lark driven by cartoonish special effects and an ingenious double-layered nostalgia that allows it to become a virtual mixtape of ‘70s hits that predate its intended audience: “Hooked on a Feeling,” “The Piña Colada Song,” “Fooled Around and Fell in Love,” etc."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"Unlike the stiff-jawed heroics of the other Marvel films, this feels a little looser and lighter, with Pratt as charming, amoral accidental leader Peter Quill, an earthling among the stars who, as he will tell you, is also known as the roving brigand “Starlord.”"
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"Director James Gunn’s presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant — as does Chris Pratt’s winning performance as the most blissfully spaced-out space crusader this side of Buckaroo Banzai."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,63,"For every scene that soars into the dizzying heights of the pop sublime, there's another that crashes back down into the mundane troughs of studio-mandated formula."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,60,"The movie practically satirises itself as it goes along, glossing over its own absurdity in the process."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,It’s a bit of a botch.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,"Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,"Gunn has to juggle so many plot elements — so many booming galactic battles, so many whisker-close brushes with death — that it's little wonder he loses his grip on the thing. He inserts occasional moments of wonder but doesn't bother to smooth over the seams."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,25,"Guardians of the Galaxy brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.”"
The Croods,7.2,187168425,78,A spirited and eye-popping stealth charmer.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"Considering the fact that a young girl is picking her nose on the movie poster, The Croods is surprisingly evolved."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"This Chris Sanders fellow knows how to craft a heart-warming animation, and if not for a few minor problems this would have had a legitimate shot at the best animated movie of 2013."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"Familiar family dynamics are amusingly exaggerated in the Paleolithic setting, where the most basic necessities require everyone's full-time attention."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,75,"The first pleasant surprise of spring, a gorgeous kids’ cartoon with heart and wit, if not exactly a firm grasp of paleontology."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,70,"As family viewing, it's pleasant enough: primitive, yes, but in a digitally sophisticated way that's boisterous, funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,67,"Although The Croods has lazy patches throughout, the conclusion is exciting and, lo and behold, surprising."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,67,"The film itself doesn’t practice what it preaches: From the typically blocky DreamWorks CGI to the emphasis on bruising slapstick over verbal wit, The Croods takes the low road at every opportunity, giving lip service to enlightenment while following a Flintstonian instinct to keep punching the clock at the quarry."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"Just good, goofy fun, for a generation too young to have met Bamm-Bamm."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"More than anything, the striking spectacle of primordial flora and one-of-a-kind fauna makes it easy for audiences to get pleasantly lost in the adventure."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"While paying lip service to the spirit of invention and adventure, the movie doesn’t do much for the evolution of children’s animated entertainment."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"The movie is well-edited and lean, a fast-paced, action-filled bit of froth that manages to be diverting and surprisingly fun."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"Some of the exotic landscape the group trailblazes looks imported from “Avatar” — happily, bringing that immersively dimensionalized, eye-catching quality along with it."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,63,"At least there's Cage, who has become an astute voice actor, finding some odd, clever, energetic line readings consistently fresher than The Croods itself."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The Croods isn’t particularly smart, but it has just enough wit to keep us engaged and just enough speed to keep us from feeling restless."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The movie is at its most interesting and amusing when riffing on how cavemen might have reacted to new experiences and ideas, like fire and shoes. Whether the kiddies will appreciate that is unclear, but they’ll certainly like the voice work done by Emma Stone as Eep."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The Croods are not meant to be beauties — they are, after all, a family of Neanderthals. But is the animation meant to be ugly, too?"
The Croods,7.2,187168425,60,"The jokes only make up for the pedestrian plot for so long. There was a time when animated fare with generic stories sufficed. But now we expect more from them, because they have, pardon the pun, evolved. The Croods, like its title family, hasn’t."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,58,A handful of adrenalizing sequences of animated anarchy can't save this story from feeling overly primitive.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,58,"Though it's impressive in many technical and surface ways, The Croods lets us down on the essentials of character and story, and no amount of late-stage father/daughter bonding or vertiginous 3D cliffside tumbling can make up for that."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"It’s ""Identity Thief"" with flying piranhas, or Plains, Trains & Automobiles on foot."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"Good stuff comes when bad stuff happens; that's when some of the movie animation prowess kicks into high gear. But too many of the ""solutions"" the guys concoct are so impossibly complex or just downright ridiculous — puppetry comes to mind — that like the continents, it's a little too easy to drift away."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"Although state-of-the-art in its rendering of textures, movement and stereography, The Croods, adopts a relatively primitive approach to storytelling with its Flintstonian construction of stock, ill-fitting narrative elements."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,50,"Sanders and DeMicco’s script doesn’t have the robust plotting, consistent wit or flavorful character development of the best family animation. And some of the voice actors have too little to work with."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,"Aside from a few witty Looney Tunes–esque sight gags, such as one hilarious image of a woolly mammoth being swallowed up by the tectonically shifting earth, the stereoscopic visuals are a busy, personality-free digital blur."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,"The Croods does a lot of things well -- even if it does none of them extraordinarily. The end result is a solidly middle-of-the-road bit of animation -- but the kind that is easily forgotten as soon as something more evolved, and original, comes along."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,"It's amiable enough, but it makes ""The Flintstones"" look like it was scripted by Karl Popper."
The Croods,7.2,187168425,40,But for the most part it’s Neanderthal compared to the Pixar stable.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,38,The film takes more than a few pages from the James Cameron playbook.
The Croods,7.2,187168425,25,I’d like to take back all those times I said Nicolas Cage was one of the most annoying actors on film. It turns out he’s equally terrible when he’s only on the soundtrack. And yet Cage is the least of the problems with The Croods.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,75,"Theron proves the master of operatic hissy fits, Blunt lets the pain show beneath the glacial cool, Chastain brings her usual Juilliard-schooled commitment to the occasion, and Hemsworth is Hemsworthian, if oft-times incomprehensible, delivering his lines in a gorse-y whorl of vowels and consonants."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,67,"It’s all pretty silly, but it compensates for a lack of emotional weight with star power."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,60,"It’s a welcome surprise: sharper and funnier than its doom-laden predecessor, with a fantasy setting immersive enough to distract from the narrative’s various chips and cracks."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,60,"With a wraparound narrative that never really strikes a balance between past and present, all that axe-flinging, ice-casting action makes a modest impact."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,"Winter's War isn't tedious. Amiably bad movies seldom are. Theron and Blunt look fabulous doing silly, screechy things in Colleen Atwood's costumes. Chastain makes Sara a formidable match in battle and bed with Eric, who becomes less important as these wonder women converge."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,"In spite of all of its myriad shortfalls, this film succeeds as well as it does because it does not shy away from this truth, and because it gives us a romances that feel so true between people we would like to see succeed."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,It’s the movie equivalent of a cake that’s all frosting.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,55,"If all else fails, at least it’s a movie smart enough to know that, frankly, you can’t beat Charlize Theron, covered in gold, shooting lethal spiky tentacles out of her midriff."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"By cramming far too much material into 114 minutes, The Huntsman: Winter’s War feels rushed and incomplete. It doesn’t help that the screenplay is at times awful, forcing accomplished actors to recite excruciatingly bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"Unlike the smarter ""Maleficent,"" a revisionist Sleeping Beauty created by the same producers, what The Huntsman series lacks is any intriguing psychology."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"Every time Charlize Theron is on screen, the movie gets crazy campy, and therefore at least somewhat interesting."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,The mishmash of filmmaking makes it clear this was a movie made by committee — and clearly that committee was composed of folks who were not all on the same page when it came to spinning what could have been a much more engaging piece of fantasy storytelling.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"While the funny, action-packed sequences are the best parts, they are indicative of the film’s main problems: an inability to focus and an overly complicated plot."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,Pretty uninspired material for a dream-teaming of actresses who currently rate among the edgiest of them all.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"From scene to scene, there are some beautiful images in the fantasy world where this is set, but frustratingly, it never adds up to something that comes to life. This feels like terrific production design and costuming in search of a story worth telling."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"If judged by fluid effects work, Atwood’s stunning costumes, and the fun of watching Theron and Blunt reach new heights of arch camp, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is a triumph. By any other measure, though, it’s a far more qualified prospect"
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"It’s passably entertaining, and like the last one breathtakingly crafted, especially Colleen Atwood’s microscopically detailed costumes."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,42,"There’s very little in The Huntsman: Winter's War itself that is actively bad. Compared to some of its blockbuster rivals, it’s reasonably watchable, never offensive, and mostly coherent."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,It’s all too much without ever turning into much at all.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"This unintentionally fractured ends up one big mess. It's a pretty mess, mind you -- which is fitting in a way, given the sordid affair that birthed it -- but a mess all the same."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"The actors are all game, but the job’s beneath them – Hemsworth, a pro, and a real champ at faking enthusiasm for this dud; Theron, still doing camp but this time with no tempering complexity or empathy; Blunt, stuck playing a frost-bitten Mommie Dearest."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"The film borrows plenty, but it brings nothing new."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,There’s almost nothing in this movie that hasn’t been seen elsewhere before. And done a whole lot better.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"Visual inventiveness and spectacular casting can’t quite salvage a muddled fantasy epic that, if it were a magic mirror, would be held together with gaffer tape."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"In many ways this is an adult Frozen with Gothic sensibilities by way of The Lord Of The Rings, making for a derivative pastiche of the past two decades' cinematic fantasy offerings."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"All told, ‘Winter’s War’ is not the fairest sequel, but it’s not so terrible that it deserves to be taken out to the forest and finished off."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,The Huntsman is a flabby mess — yet another sequel with no reason to exist.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"It’s a dunderheaded follow-up, for sure, but it’s at least buoyed by Chris Hemsworth’s charisma and the few times where Winter’s War embraces complete camp."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"If you liked “Frozen” but wish it had been angrier, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is for you."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"The overriding despair of Winter's War's imagery calls into question who, exactly, the film is for."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,33,"The film's narrative is both plodding and predictable, and after the third or fourth battle sequence that leans so heavily on loud, thudding noises and swirling leather topcoats that it's impossible to see who is actually hitting who (and, moreover, why), audiences may be in danger of remembering just which ""reimagined"" fairy tale they're watching on screen."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"There’s only one reason to see The Huntsman: Winter’s War: Gowns! Insane, off-the-hook gowns."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"A convoluted narrative yields not a single, palpable moment of drama."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,The film absolutely delivers on the scenery-chewing front. And yet the movie is still hollow and joyless.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"The sheer abundance of on-screen ornamentation isn’t quite enough to make The Huntsman: Winter’s War a beautiful film.... Still, it’s one that has been exhaustively designed by many hands — which only further shows up its inelegant patchwork in the writing department."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,This incoherent screenplay seems to have been written by a roomful of the gorilla-like trolls who show up in the movie at one point.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,A resoundingly unlovable movie that almost resists being watched.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,"Nothing can match seeing Theron and Blunt try to out-camp each other, providing the only glimmer of entertainment in a film dedicated to being ponderous. No one sings ""Let It Go,"" but my advice to audiences is to do just that before mistakenly buying a ticket."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,"The mirror effects are still striking, Theron, Blunt, Hemsworth and Chastain still fairy-tale beautiful. But The Huntsman: Winter’s War, is the very picture of a movie that should have never been made. It never, for one second, gives us a reason to think otherwise."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,20,It really is a nuclear war of dullness.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,10,"Its badness is not extreme, but exemplary: It’s everything wrong with Hollywood today stuffed into a little less than two hours."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,88,"After Earth is ultimately too thin of a story to support all of its grandiose embellishments, but so what? It's better to try to pack every moment with beauty and feeling than to shrug and smirk. The film takes the characters and their feelings seriously, and lets its actors give strong, simple performances."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"That there are no surprises (jumps, yes, surprises, no) should surprise no one – Will Smith movies must uplift the human spirit and reaffirm our best instincts while reassuring us that our ticket money has been well invested."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"In truth, despite more corn than Mel Gibson grows on his farm in ""Signs"" (another Shyamalan effort), After Earth is worth a look."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"Won't change your world, but it's attractive and Smith the Elder, lowering his voice to subterranean James Earl Jones levels, delivers a shrewd minimalist performance. His son may get there yet."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,60,"Jaden Smith takes centre stage in a futuristic rites of passager that plays like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. Although ""Oblivion"" narrowly remains this summer’s better ruined-Earth actioner."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,58,"The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,58,"Shyamalan’s sensibility may not be enough to turn After Earth into a great (or even very good) film, but it does yield interesting — and at times strikingly realized — results."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"Though it's meant to be pulse-pounding, After Earth is a lethargic slog."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"There’s nothing more to this movie than the set-up. Even though Cypher is slowly bleeding to death, and Kitai is running out of oxygen capsules that allow him to breathe in the toxic air, there’s no sense of urgency, either. At least Shyamalan, sensing the thinness of the material, doesn’t stretch things out."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"M. Night Shyamalan has directed movies that are surprising, hokey, suspenseful, sentimental, clever, touching or cheesy. But until After Earth, he hadn’t made any that are dull from end to end."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"The film progresses to the point where it feels less like father and son, and more like a young boy listening to an inspirational audiobook."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,42,"It’s impossible to take this movie seriously, certainly not as seriously as it takes itself."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,42,"The plot is simplicity itself, and Jaden's quirk-free character and bland performance don't add anything. It's actually a little sad that M. Night Shyamalan has descended to this sort of vanity-project work-for-hire, but at least he didn't insist on some absurd twist ending."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"Despite the Smith family’s association with Scientology, which unmistakably informs this tale’s belief system (“Fear is a Choice”), as well as its shaky attempts at mythic patterning, it is in no way the laughable shambles that John Travolta’s infamous ""Battlefield Earth"" was."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"Prepare to cringe and snicker whenever the characters are talking, but gasp when Shyamalan just shows amazing stuff."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"In his defense, the kid is saddled with a task that even a more experienced actor might have trouble pulling off: He must carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders, given little more to act opposite than a succession of green-screen predators. Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots, Jaden can’t turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"What undoes the film is its rather rancid parent-child sentimentality (a Shyamalan staple, admittedly) and a charisma-free performance from the younger Smith that suggests the apple has fallen very far from the tree."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The jolts are of the jump-out-from-behind-the-door variety; you can see them coming from a long way off, too. Shyamalan seems to no longer have the confidence to let audiences figure things out or the patience to allow them to."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,This would be a difficult film even for the charismatic Papa Smith to carry. That he spends nearly the entire movie in a chair doesn't help matters.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The disappointingly generic film, which strands a father and son on Earth a thousand years after a planet-wide evacuation, will leave genre audiences pining for the more Terra-centric conceits of ""Oblivion,"" not to mention countless other future-set films that find novelty in making familiar surroundings threatening."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The film is repetitive and not as suspenseful at it tries to be. Often gorgeous, sometimes fascinating, it is ultimately unwieldy and unsurprising. It fails as a Smith-family project. Jaden Smith, who was fine in ""The Karate Kid,"" is flat here."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,38,The art of storytelling is both of distinct narrative interest and personal issue in the latest payload of calcified nonsense from one of modern cinema's oddest would-be auteurs.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,38,"An undemanding, childish adventure picture."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,35,"A disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition, After Earth doesn't play to the strengths of any of its major participants."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,33,"Fans of either Smith will be sorely disappointed. The elder never before appeared this listless on screen, and the younger misplaced his unforced rapport with the camera that made the Karate Kid reboot so impressive. Only Shyamalan delivers what moviegoers expect from him, and that's a shame."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,Were Shyamalan and Smith deliberately invoking the terror — now omnipresent in urban African-American communities — of lethal asthma attacks in children? I’m not sure how I feel about something so real and so wrenching in the context of a Grade D (unfit for human habitation) sci-fi picture like After Earth.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,For the most part it is an uninteresting slog alleviated only by the occasional unintended laugh and moments of visual beauty. Mr. Shyamalan generally torpedoes his movies with overweening self-seriousness.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,"Running, or stumbling, only 90 minutes, After Earth may lack the neck-swiveling awfulness of Shyamalan’s ""The Last Airbender,"" but it quickly sinks in its logorrheic solemnity. The movie makes ""Oblivion"" seem as jolly a romp as ""Spaceballs,"" and gives neither Shyamalan nor Smith much to smile about."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,"Jaden is fine at running, jumping, fearful trembling, and affecting steely resolution. He doesn't yet have his father's charisma; perhaps to help him out, dad opted not to bring that charisma to the set."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,30,"Shyamalan is clearly a director-for-hire here, his disinterest palpable from first frame to last. Nowhere in evidence is the gifted ""Sixth Sense"" director who once brought intricately crafted setpieces and cinematic sleight-of-hand to even the least of his own movies."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"The sad truth about After Earth is that not only is it difficult to find things it does well, but there are numerous examples of outright incompetence dotting the landscape."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"You can’t blame Will Smith for wanting to give his son a leg up in the business. Maybe one day Jaden will have his father’s career — and his ability to carry a movie. For now, it’s a little premature to ask him to bear the weight of this soggy, waterlogged “Earth” on his skinny shoulders."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"The young Smith has energy, but not the acting chops. And he's no miracle worker. The burden of carrying this dull, lifeless movie is just too much. And it's hell on an audience. It's not a good sign when you sit there thinking – Make. It. Stop."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,Surprise — this bad dream is for real.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"Quite simply, this is one of the worst films of 2013."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"Jaden is not ready for his solo spotlight, and the film is the same action over and over. Another bad movie from Shyamalan."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,25,"Basically, this is Smith and his real-life son, Jaden (both affecting ridiculous mid-Atlantic accents) talking the audience to death for something like 90 minutes before the closing credits."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,20,"He's done it again. M Night Shyamalan has done it again. Again. Done it. Again. He has given us another film for which the only appropriate expression is stammering, gibbering wonder that anyone can keep making such uncompromisingly terrible movies with such stamina and dedication."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,20,"The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified.  Everything is spelled out, underlined in red."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,12,"After Earth stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can’t even be considered a rough draft, this is a movie almost daring an audience to emotionally detach throughout. For shame!"
After Earth,4.8,60522097,0,"Summer 2013 has its first bomb, and sadly, it’s landed right on Will Smith."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,88,"This movie doesn't get huffy, it gets laughs."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,80,A highly entertaining and heartfelt action comedy that ought to steal more laughs than any other film this holiday season.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,80,A smoothly engineered crowd pleaser.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,78,"To a one, they nail the humor, all right, but they also, quite crucially, humanize the high concept."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"As far as sophisticated caper flicks go, Tower Heist is oceans away from George Clooney's crew. Compared to other recent comedies, it's pretty light on the laughs."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"It keeps things light and entertaining. And for $8 admission, that's never a bad investment."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"Smoothly made and smart enough. It's not going for too much, but I laughed a lot."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"For what it is - recessionary wish-fulfillment escapism, with a lot of highly skilled familiar faces in its amply qualified cast - it's fun."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,75,"A winning ""Robin Hood and his Merry Doormen"" comedy about getting even. A cast of comedy specialists each deliver their comic specialties to perfection, delivering double-takes and one liners so well that you don't notice how clunky the actual caper in this caper comedy is."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,"Tower Heist is overstuffed with actors, and yet Ratner manages to give each of them one or two good moments."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,"You can't help leaving the film with the following thought: Man, it's good to see Murphy being funny again."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,"More than the marquee names, the second bananas keep the movie bobbing along: Broderick's pharmaceutically vague hangdog act is perfect (""If you need me, I'll be living in this box""), while Peña turns out to be a fine comedian, an enthusiastically yipping dumb puppy here."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,70,A shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"Tower Heist is as over-inflated as those Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons that are featured in the movie's climax. Also similarly, it's entertaining in its own predictable way."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"There's not much to say about a jerry-built caper comedy, except that this one has timeliness on it side, and some first-rate clowns."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,An improbably satisfying action comedy.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"Devoting more time to the setup than to the follow-through, Tower Heist doesn't really build suspense so much as it builds impatience - for the thing to be over."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,63,"The movie is broad and clumsy, and the dialogue cannot be described as witty, but a kind of grandeur creeps into the screenplay by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,Fun if uneven stuff from Ratner. A welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy and an even-more-welcome turn by the ever-excellent Alan Alda.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,"Tower Heist might not be a classic (it's not), but at least for a little while it will make you laugh instead of cry about the current state of affairs, which is more than you can say about a lot of things."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,Highly recommended if you want to watch an assortment of rich movie stars feel your pain.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,"Boasts an unusually strong cast of actors, who boost the slick screenplay into a satisfying popcorn picture."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,60,"Tower Heist is funny in the way of so many Hollywood comedies, meaning that individual scenes are often crisply written and played, but the whole doesn't add up to anything."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"If this film turns out to be a big success, malls everywhere may want to hire more security."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"Doesn't demand much of the audience, sure, but it doesn't provide much, either.  It's as if an all-star gang of would-be crooks got together to rip off...moviegoers."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"In the end, Tower Heist isn't a black Ocean's Eleven or a bold leap forward for feature-film distribution, just a passable piece of commercial entertainment that falls closer to product than art."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,58,"Tower Heist is the cinematic version of a Trump property: overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"The combined efforts of this fine ensemble cast make Tower Heist go down easier than it otherwise might, but the film's potential as a buddy comedy is sadly wasted."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"Tower Heist feigns being an ""Ocean's 11"" for schmucks, but plays like a retread of ""48 Hours."""
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,Tower Heist could and should have been much more. Mr. Ratner goes for the safe bet and the easy score.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"The type of film with which Mr. Ratner has claimed to be infatuated is itself like a caper - it requires precise execution. Tower Heist is more like that 10-story Snoopy, as he drunkenly bobs along Central Park West."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,Twice as funny as I thought it would be but not half as funny as it could have been.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,The caper is a dud - so stupid and implausible from beginning to end that it's impossible to take it seriously for even the briefest of moments.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,The best thing about this mildly diverting but instantly forgettable comedy is that it seems to have awakened something in Murphy that had laid dormant for much of the past two decades.
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"Back when it was planned as an African-American ""Ocean's Eleven,"" this project might have been edgy, but the script has been whitewashed into a generic caper comedy with pretensions of timeliness."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,50,"During the heist itself, the suspense is palpable, if only because Christophe Beck's funky score blares its horns so insistently, one can't help but feel anxious. But the laughs don't follow."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,40,"A set piece involving a skyscraper and a sports car proves he can induce sweaty palms, but one nail-biting moment and some much-misssed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,40,"Toss everything you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender, press ""Pulse,"" and pray: such appears to be the method behind Tower Heist."
Tower Heist,6.2,78046570,25,"Defiantly graceless, Brett Ratner deals in loudness, haplessness, obviousness, and, certainly, crudeness, reminding you of his directorial presence with such inclusions as a scolded kid who tells his disciplinarian to ""suck it."""
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"A hugely entertaining and more lavishly mounted follow-up to 2000's ""Shanghai Noon,"" the high-concept East-meets-Western that first teamed top-billed duo, pic rides even taller in the saddle as a fleet and funny crowd-pleaser."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"With Shanghai Knights, he (Chan) has come through with one of his best. This time, it's personable."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"Turns out to be that rarest of Hollywood creatures: a sequel that one-ups the originalThese two smart, happy movie stars prove that silliness doesnt have to be moronic."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,Far from great but greatly entertaining.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"What Chan represents -- the humor and charm and the sheer physical beauty of seeing him in action -- as well as the lazy, ping-pong repartee he achieves with Wilson, is the essence of the casual, deceptively artless art of movies."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,80,"Coasts heavily on Chan and Wilson's charm, which would be a big problem if those prodigiously gifted stars weren't taking on roles that fit like two pairs of comfortable slippers."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,Bounds from one gag to another like an eager puppy.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"The unlikely cowboys play off each other's strengths like the best doubles team in tennis.
The exquisiteness of this match is that Chan and Wilson are both reactive comedy actors."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,That his dialogue is often deliberately anachronistic is part of the joke -- and Wilson's sly delivery is often funnier than the lines themselves.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,This is an action-comedy sequel so indefatigably preposterous and farklemt -- as they say in certain Upper West Side saloons -- that it actually improves on the original.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"There are three action sequences here so delightful, so hilariously deploying an old tool for a new use, that they prompt smiles long after I saw the film."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"The star interplay and anachronisms recapture some of the surreal spirit of the Crosby-Hope Road movies, and the end-credit outtakes are funny enough to sustain that getting-hoary device for at least one more picture."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,"Actually a pretty entertaining movie, in a kick-you-in-the-pants kind of way. A relative rarity -- a solid no-brow comedy."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,75,A hoot.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,70,"Despite his advancing years, Chan delivers some fleet slapstick; like his hero Buster Keaton he works intuitively with levers, pulleys, ladders, and umbrellas."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,67,"This is a movie where you can just sit back and revel in it, warts and all."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,67,"For what it's worth, the film also goes out of its way to be a lavish visual re-creation of the 1880s."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,63,"It's a gimcrack assemblage of gags, action scenes, favorite moments from the first hit and diorama-like views of high and low Victorian culture."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,63,Uproarious imbecility.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,63,"Pretty mediocre entertainment, and probably better suited for home viewing than a trip to the multiplex."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,60,"The adventure-book pace and topsy-turvy English setting evoke the feel of Stephen Sommers's ""Mummy"" films."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,60,"Loving Jackie Chan has always been easy, which is why it would be nice if he could find better material in which to bask in his long-sought American stardom or, alternately, ease into bad movies as effortlessly as his co-star."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,60,"Only promised a few good fights, a lot of chuckles, and an easy way to kill a couple of hours. In today's Hollywood that's hard enough to deliver."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,50,So appallingly slipshod in all the usual departments is this sequel to the engaging martial-arts comedy Western ''Shanghai Noon'' that you're tempted to cite its makers for contempt.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,50,"Chan and Wilson's easy camaraderie remains eminently watchable, but the rough edges from last time out are missed."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,50,"Why would the writers bother with narrative when the story is just something that kills time, and brain cells, between feats and fists of fury?"
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,"Most of the film's humor derives from smug anachronisms (the Brit-pop soundtrack, Wang and Roy's use of modern slang) and jokes about bad English food, teeth and weather that were old when Victoria was a girl."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,I would also like to state for a fact that fight scenes in absence of all other drama arent interesting to watch.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,"If youre the type of moviegoer who finds the idea of 19th-century characters using phrases such as ""Be cool"" and ""You must work out"" in their conversations, this is the film for you."
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,40,It's too bad Chan's imagination and delicacy were wasted in this movie.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,30,Grating.
Shanghai Knights,6.2,60476872,25,Desperately unfunny action comedy.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,The best kind of summer blockbuster -- the kind that makes you immediately crave a sequel.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"It's a rich, impressive comic-book fantasy -- easily the summer's best ""blockbuster."""
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"The film's strength and its entertainment lie in John Myhre's production design, its generally appealing cast...and, perhaps most importantly, a canny degree of self-parody."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"For diehard fans, X-Men is full of in jokes and sly references -- For everybody else, there's the thrill of the unknown."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,88,"Balances brains, brawn and heart in ideal proportions. The actors - some first-rate, all enjoyable - never get overshadowed by the special effects, which dazzle us without gory excess."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,85,"One of this year's most dazzling entertainments, not to mention one of the best comic-book movies ever made."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,83,"Singer deftly crafts a sleek, unusually tight film that balances comic-book adventure, pulp opera and the fear of being different."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"When it comes to stoopid fun, X-Men could be the summer movie to beat."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"Exciting mainly because anything can happen and does, the movie drags a bit as it approaches a climax set atop the Statue of Liberty."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"While X-Men doesn't take your breath away wire-to-wire the way ""The Matrix"" did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"A distinctively absorbing entertainment, offering just enough popcorn thrills for mass audiences and just enough chewiness for hardcore sci-fi fans."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"The most enjoyable piece of pop fantasy of the summer; sleek, elegant, exciting and wildly, outrageously imaginative."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,A solid action story with inventive battles (one on the Statue of Liberty) and satisfyingly gooey special effects.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,Spectacular special effects and sets.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"Doesn't match up against the new millennium martial artistry of ""The Matrix,"" nor do the special effects - but he knows how to establish characters and relationships."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,This feast of fantasy is worth it.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,X-Men flies to the rescue with superheroes who have real substance.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"Loaded with fine performances, traffics in audacious images and generally comports itself with a great deal more grace and gravitas than most movies with roots in fantastic themes."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,70,Nearly the perfect balance between straight-faced pulp action and amused wonder at the outlandish world of comic books.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,67,The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to view itself as a modern moral fable of sorts.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,"Recedes to a string of mere action exploits. These are proficiently executed but, for all their visual authority, not much more than routine."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,"I started out liking this movie, while waiting for something really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,A mixed bag with the promise of a better sequel.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,60,Plays like a so-so middle chapter of an epic series rather than a fitting kickoff.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,60,"Stylish, exciting and an occasionally poignant sci-fi adventure spectacle."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"The mood is awfully dark for an escapist fantasy, though, and the high-tech mayhem gets repetitious."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,A very odd cinematic creature.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"Missing are well-choreographed action scenes, likable characters and involving plot twists."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"Clumsy when it should be light on its feet, the movie takes itself even more seriously than the comic book and its fans do, which is a superheroic achievement."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"When the film version isn't assaulting you with gizmos, it's an awkward, depersonalized piece of hackwork."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,38,Superhero comic book movie with a script so feeble it might have been written with crayons.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,20,"An ambitious, frustrating drag."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,10,"Isn't juvenile, it isn't even infantile. It's prenatal!"
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,100,"An intense, powerful film."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,89,"The most costly and the most popular film in South Korean history is also one of the most gripping and epic war films ever made, and certainly the only one I can think of the portrays the Korean war from the viewpoint of both sides of the conflict."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,88,"Belongs to that brand of sweeping, conflict-era drama epitomized by ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Gone with the Wind"" and TV miniseries ""North and South."""
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,80,A complex film about the minefield of loyalty and betrayal.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,75,An anti-war spectacle that uses the story of brothers divided by the 1950 civil war as a metaphor for the wounds of the split.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,75,"Always entertains, just like ''Pearl Harbor'' and the rest of the best of Hollywood's dumb war movies."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,"While it comes on like a flag-waver, it actually delivers something more nuanced. Its underlying skepticism about the Korean War seems to have jibed with the current national mood: The picture was, deservedly, a huge hit."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,"With killing as an end in itself, combatants lose sight of what they were supposed to be taking up arms for in the first place. It's a terrible lesson, and one that Tae Guk Gi teaches with unexpected confidence."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,"The cloying score aside, this is a searing depiction of war in all its savagery, waste, and folly, with artfully choreographed sequences that surpass the conventions of the genre."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,70,You may find some of the story developments melodramatic -- I did -- but the film itself is quite powerful.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,63,"Shamelessly contrived and manipulative, Tae Guk Gi packs a visceral wallop."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,63,It's hard to remain unmoved by Kang's deeply heartfelt homage to his nation's past.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,63,The film is never as powerful or convincing as it should be.
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,60,"In the rare moments when a rifle, grenade, howitzer, bayonet, dagger, fist, land mine, or flamethrower isn't being deployed, the film pushes its melodramatic plotline with soap operatic shamelessness."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,60,"Far more ambivalent and ambiguous film than Mr. Spielberg's. Both North and South are portrayed as brutal, abusive regimes that use their citizens as so much cannon fodder."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,60,"It's easy to view the story of these brothers as a larger metaphor for the relationship between the two Koreas, which gives the film an added resonance that your typical Hollywood war movie wouldn't possess."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,50,"Kang remains a superb technician, but somewhere the movie forgot to pack any genuine emotion along with its ordnance and K rations."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,50,"After a sentimental opening sequence, he (Kang) scarcely lets the film pause to breathe, which dulls its effectiveness."
Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo,8.1,1111061,25,Almost entirely devoted to combat violence and sentimental interludes.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,63,"Lame, but in a good way."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,60,"Lambert is as uncharismatic as ever, while Van Peebles is as frightening as a wrestler in mock angry mood, and just as ridiculous. To Morahan's credit, however, he smoothly continues the series' tradition of flashy images, showy sfx, aerial landscape shots and driving rock tunes."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,50,"Although Christopher Lambert repeats his film role as the immortal action hero, he is less dynamic than he was in Highlander or even Highlander 2, The Quickening. He is also far less charismatic and interesting to watch than Adrian Paul of the European television serial. Moreover, in this film, Lambert inexplicably whispers his lines, while the special effects are deafening."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,40,Those immortals keep noting that there can be only one. Perhaps they mean there should have been only one.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,38,Highlander: The Final Dimension is no more compelling than the average pile of bricks.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,25,An incoherent mess.
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,25,"An unbelievably trashy meltdown of the tartan warrior franchise, Highlander III checks in as a breakneck, roller-coaster genre ride that’s brainless fodder for undiscriminating auds."
Highlander III: The Sorcerer,4.4,13829734,25,"Highlander 3 has an edge over its prequels in that it's so shoddily directed that it's probably a great deal of fun to watch after a couple of six-packs. Actually, that's probably the only time it might be fun to watch, and I'm not going to be the guy to put that theory to the test for you."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,70,"Live and Let Die borrowed from blaxploitation; The Man with the Golden Gun took a couple of kicks at kung fu, though in a distinctly half-hearted fashion."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,63,"Rarely does The Man with the Golden Gun take anything seriously. Mary Goodnight is as clumsy as they come. Pepper and Nick Nack are cartoonish. There are more jokes-per-minute than in any other Bond film. Even John Barry's score is less earnest than usual, and the opening song is ridiculous."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,60,Whilst this takes itself a little too lightly it has a lot going for it.
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,60,"Enjoyment requires denying the increasingly problematic truth about Bond: As heroes go, 007 represents a bygone notion of the privileged white man taking what’s his and leaving destruction in his wake."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,50,"Roger Moore already seems winded in his second outing as Bond. And the film's comedic approach to martial arts justly rankles true 007 afficionados. Compensation comes in the form of Christopher Lee's delicious take on evil as Scaramanga and Herve Villechaize's verve as Nick Nack, Scaramanga's dwarf manservant."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Mr. Moore functions like a vast garden ornament. Pedantic, sluggish on the uptake, incapable of even swaggering, he's also clumsy at innuendo. If you enjoyed the early Bond films as much as I did, you'd better skip this one."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond is blandness personified. It is left to Christopher Lee, playing a kind of Westernised, Dracula-esque Fu Manchu, to lend some semblance of style and suavity as Scaramanga, the man with a hideout in Red China and a hankering after the status of gentleman."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,Roger Moore is a pastry chef's idea of James Bond; but Christopher Lee as the archetype of the evil antagonist makes this 007 outing just about bearable.
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Screenwriters Maibaum and Mankiewicz attempted to downplay the gadgetry this time around, but their attempts at adding more humor hinder plot development. The film's pace lags until the climactic finale."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,Roger Moore's second outing as 007 does not do the subject matter justice. Or the character. Or any paying member of the audience.
Beverly Hills Cop,7.3,234760478,83,"Murphy exudes the kind of cheeky, cocky charm that has been missing from the screen since Cagney was a pup, snarling his way out of the ghetto. But as befits a manchild of the soft-spoken '80s, there is an insinuating sweetness about the heart that is always visible on the sleeve of Murphy's habitual sweatshirt."
Beverly Hills Cop,7.3,234760478,80,"Beverly Hills Cop finds Eddie Murphy doing what he does best: playing the shrewdest, hippest, fastest-talking underdog in a rich man's world."
Beverly Hills Cop,7.3,234760478,80,"Eddie Murphy looks like the latest victim of the Star Magic Syndrome, in which it is assumed that a movie will be a hit simply because it stars an enormously talented person. Thus it is not necessary to give much thought to what he does or says, or to the story he finds himself occupying."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Though Aliens is unable to eschew some obvious sci-fi conventions and those of other genres as well, it brings a fresh and lively spirit to this tired cinematic clime. Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Aliens is one of the most intensely shocking films to open in ages: Even if you think you've got the stamina for cinematic suspense, you may find yourself out in the lobby, midway, catching your breath. This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"A nonstop, high-tech, souped-up war movie, with gung ho marines blasting special-effects creatures, and a genuinely convincing, exciting action heroine."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"For this movie stands to be something its predecessor was not, a megahit. And it deserves to be, for it is a remarkable accomplishment: a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,Truly great cinema- manages to dodge that 'dodgy sequel' curse with ease.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,I'm giving the movie a high rating for its skill and professionalism and because it does the job it says it will do. I am also advising you not to eat before you go to see it.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"But of all the film's choices, the best was Weaver. She's its white-hot core, given fine, irascible dialogue to come blazing out of that patrician mouth, and the chance to look, for a moment, like a space-dusted Sleeping Beauty in her hyper-sleep casket."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,90,Director James Cameron dumps the decorative effects of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien in favor of some daring narrative strategies and a tight thematic focus.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,James Cameron's vault into the big time after scoring with the exploitation actioner The Terminator makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills - emphasis is decidedly on the plural aspect of the title.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,"The startling thing about ""Aliens"" is how obsessed it is with women as child bearers. It's  the theme that allows the movie to have all the trappings of a typical science fiction/action movie while creating a primal emotive connection for the audience."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,"Under the direction of James (''The Terminator'') Cameron, [the special effects team has] put together a flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Cameron isn't as concerned with scares or atmosphere, the staples of traditional horror films, as he is with setting up difficult situations for his characters to get out of, leaving audiences deliciously on edge."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Cruder than the original, Aliens is a distinctly greedy mega-production."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn`t want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,80,"The stylish and engrossing reinterpretation of the mythological king's early years lacks character development, but makes up for it with swashbuckling, sword-fighting, beast-slaying fun."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,75,"With Legend of the Sword, the filmmaker isn’t remaking or adapting anything. This is his version of Arthur’s origin story and, if nothing else, it’s kinetic and attention-grabbing."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,75,"In its finest moments, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is swift and clever and exhilarating. At its low points, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword plays like a cheesy B-movie, with ridiculous monsters and unintentionally laugh-inducing moments."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,70,"King Arthur wants desperately to please, and it mostly succeeds."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,67,"Ritchie’s ‘King Arthur’ is a pleasing big budget spectacle, oddly aligned to the filmmaker’s thematic interests and startlingly compatible with his signature razzle-dazzle style. In fact, the soggiest moments in the movie are the ones that adhere the closest to that ambitious multi-film strategy, lessening the fun, and emptying its impact."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,63,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a fun, if sacrilegious, first step in a franchise creation — one that observes the first commandment of storytelling: Thou shalt not be boring."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,60,"Put your fingers in your ears when the talking starts, and you might enjoy the view."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,60,"Ritchie’s film is at all times over the top, crashing around its digital landscapes in all manner of beserkness, sometimes whooshing along, sometimes stuck in the odd narrative doldrum. But it is often surprisingly entertaining, and whatever clunkers he has delivered in the past, Ritchie again shows that a film-maker of his craft and energy commands attention."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"Sure, it doesn’t always work — mainly due to some bad writing, shoddy visual effects, and tonal oddities —  but when King Arthur: Legend of the Sword finds its stride, it’s a neat little tincture of Snatchian attitude and fantasy lore that is a good bit of early summer fun."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"Ritchie is so adept that the film is compulsively watchable, but it’s watchable in the same way as a massive train wreck or the slow-motion demolition of a high-rise."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"The franchise-hungry tentpole-itis of the present studio model has produced oh-so-many dumb rehashes of classic myths and fairy tales, but this is the first that is always funny on purpose."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,King Arthur could have been a rollicking blast. Instead it’s just another wannabe blockbuster with too much flash and not enough soul.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,55,"There are quick cuts and CG imagery and bro-ing out in nearly equal proportions; I found some of this excess to be heady and exciting, but by the end of the film’s running time, it all became a bit tiresome, to say nothing of tiring."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Some might find it stimulating. Others will find it bonkers. Watching Jude Law do a slow-motion howl, for example, is certainly … something."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword isn't a movie as much as a feature length montage of bastardized lore and rejected Game of Thrones pitches.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Arthur and Vortigern mix it up amid a lot of shenanigans, detours and filler, some bad, some good and all of it disposable."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Unfortunately, “Arthur” is rarely at its best, bogged down in countless CGI sequences of battlefields or monsters."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"There are some fun bits in the film. Law is kind of funny, in and over-the-top, does-he-mean-to-be-like-this way. Hunnam is game for playing Arthur. But Ritchie, in his attempt to ensure there’s never a dull moment, makes it all exhausting."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"King Arthur is neither Guy Ritchie’s worst film nor his best, but it might well be his most frustrating. A compendium of all the things that make the British director so occasionally exciting and so often irritating, this new, hyper-stylized take on the Arthurian legends veers between genius and idiocy."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,Legend of the Sword’s overemphasis on the supernatural and the visually spectacular mortally wounds an often-rollicking adventure.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"In all honesty, the rat-a-tat repartee and tasty touches of Classic pre-Madonna Ritchie don’t excuse a bastardization that takes forever to get on its feet, that lacks the requisite love story (Ritchie and his “boys will be boys” pictures), that presents too much of Angle-land as a burnt-out pit quarry, that revels in anachronisms."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Commercial considerations strangle the vitality from the movie, but Ritchie does his best to bring a bit of impish wit to the proceedings."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"From one moment to the next, it's possible to on some level enjoy the shaking up of tired conventions in a swordplay fantasy such as this and then to be dismayed by the lowbrow vulgarity of what's ended up onscreen. The film gives with one hand and takes away with the other, which can be frustrating in what's meant to be an entertainment."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,A bloated action movie with occasional breaks in the monotony. It’s Perfectly Fine™; entirely competent but unexceptional in just about every way.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,45,"The most frustrating thing about Ritchie's take on King Arthur is that it has all the necessary elements to be a great version of the story, but rather than giving them to the audience as such, they are put into a blender and thoroughly mixed."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,42,"Part “Game of Thrones,” part “Snatch,” and almost all bad, Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is one of those generic blockbusters that has nothing to say and no idea how to say it."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Somehow hectic and lumbering, diverting and dispiriting all at once, this mud-toned medieval pulp largely cleaves to the spirit of Ritchie’s “Sherlock Holmes” series, reducing a fabled figure of British lore to two hours of tough-guy swagger and head-pounding digital thwackery."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"It's all more wearying than fun. Except for Law, whose courtly sangfroid can elevate even the dumbest roles."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,The story never drags – it’s too frenetically paced for that – but it’s still kind of a drag.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Although it flickers to life at times, King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword devolves into a jumbled affair, weighed down by confusing supernatural elements and a lazy reliance on visual effects."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"This is a tonal misfire, its characters cut down by a blitzkrieg of whip pans, CGI and thunderous percussion. And with Ritchie again rummaging in his increasingly threadbare bag of tricks, the result is a movie more jaundiced than jaunty."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Ultimately, “King Arthur” is just a loud, obnoxious parade of flashy set pieces, as one visually busy, belligerent action scene after another marches by, each making less sense than the last, but all intended to overwhelm."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Excitement is fleeting, dialogue rambles and Jude Law’s tyrant-approved throne slouch pretty much sums the film’s overall attitude – a hearty “meh,” worthy of no diamond-studded crown."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Ritchie’s film...is so misshapen and inert, your imagination and memory never come close to being sparked by it. Just sticking with the plot soaks up every ounce of concentration you have."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,The result is an oxymoron: a frenetic slog. That’s unfortunately what happens to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” lumbers on for more than two hours, weighed down with oversized elephants, excessively populated action sequences, and weirdly sudden occurrence of slow motion, as if the film is yawning."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,"Optimism is nowhere to be found in Ritchie's movie itself. It is a grim and stupid thing, from one of the world's most successful mediocre filmmakers, and if Shakespeare's King Lear were blogging today, he'd supply the blurb quote: ""Nothing will come of nothing."""
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,37,"King Arthur has a vulnerable heart beating somewhere under all the grimy, sweaty muscles lovingly displayed for the camera. It’s just buried too often under narrative chaos, and the inexplicable ideal that if a story runs at double speed and triple energy, the gaping holes in the story will outpace anyone’s notice."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,33,What we really get is a film made of utter nonsense that’s even less interested in its characters than it is in telling a story.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,30,This latest retelling of the ancient Arthurian myth is a stinker for the ages.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,30,"King Arthur is guilty of many blockbuster sins critics have taken it upon themselves to call out over the last decade. And yet, seeing a version of them this derivative and dumb, with neither CGI grandeur nor a sense of fun on its side, is like a splash of cold water in the face, a reminder of how bad things can be when nobody cares."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"Ritchie aspires to be a great British director, but his working his way through British icons — Sherlock Holmes wasn’t even safe — does no one any good. He just reduces them to his own vernacular, his own level, and he ends up revealing nothing about them and everything about his own narrow vision."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"An epic bore that believes if you make a movie long and loud and repetitive enough, audiences will conclude it's saying something profound. Wrong."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is stupid enough to send you back to the one movie that did the saga right by ripping it to shreds, 1975’s “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”"
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"For all the attempts to update King Arthur to be cool and sexy, neither the character nor the film around him musters any spark."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,63,"Director Rob Cohen shoots believable action sequences, too. Nobody jumps the gap between skyscrapers or falls 40 feet, then gets up and runs away."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,60,"Rebooting novelist James Patterson's famous Alex Cross character for the big screen, Tyler Perry aims at new cinematic territory and scores a bullseye as the Detroit detective embroiled in a hunt for a mega-evil killer that turns personal."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Alex Cross isn't meant to be analyzed too deeply. The title character probably sums up the best strategy for appreciating the film's modest pleasures when he says, ""Don't overthink it; I'm just looking for a bad guy."""
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"There is one thing interesting about Alex Cross, and if you miss this, you've missed the whole movie. It's not the story - it's worse than mediocre. It's not the lead actor - nothing wrong with Tyler Perry, but as an action star he's no Vin Diesel. And it's not the dialogue, which has a clunker every other scene. It's the direction. Notice the direction. Alex Cross is a good example of what a seriously talented director can do with a heaping pile of garbage."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Alex Cross is filled with accidental comedy, and while it's a mess in any traditional movie sense, it's has its moments of preposterous fun that come in the form of a nonsensical plot and a fabulously competent, scenery-gnawing villain."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"There's nothing in Alex Cross that argues another installment is warranted, but much will depend on whether Tyler Perry's audience crosses over and continues to follow him in this new, very different role."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Where Freeman was warm but enigmatic, Perry is warm but empty."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"The sharpest five minutes in Alex Cross, by a considerable margin, belong to Giancarlo Esposito."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,A disjointed thriller with two many characters rattling around.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,50,"Perry must have felt it was high time for him to try his hand at playing a darker role. But starring in this badly directed, suspense-free film with its unintentionally laughable dialogue does Perry no favors."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"Miscast and underwritten, Alex Cross does not reinvent Tyler Perry, or James Patterson's character, or anything, really. The only appeal here is the sick kick of watching a franchise blow itself to bloody stumps."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"The resulting film, despite its occasional outbursts of action and tension, is less an action film than a psychological thriller, although even there it fumbles the ball."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"It neglects, for one thing, to make any sense."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,It's a strange sort of film that casts Gallic tough guy Jean Reno as a clean-fingernailed mogul while employing cross-dressing comic Tyler Perry as a guy capable of hand-to-hand combat with someone called The Butcher of Sligo.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"Though they lack chemistry as a team, it's gratifying to see both Perry and Burns stretching in ways they haven't before."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"You almost feel sorry for Tyler Perry, stepping out of his own universe for the first time to try to expand his range and finding himself in something as thoroughly dismal as Alex Cross."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,40,"Aside from these curious role reversals, though, Alex Cross is a mess. Drawing on every conceivable '80s B-movie action cliché and treating its beleaguered female characters like pieces of meat (literally, in one scene of butchery), director Rob Cohen squanders a surprisingly recognizable cast on a half-baked plot adapted from James Patterson's series of novels."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,38,"Nothing works. Or some of it works, but that doesn't matter because what's working is so deeply, painfully boring."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,38,"Perry shifts into full-on badass mode... well, the best that can be said is that he's sincere. For all that, he's still less embarrassing than Lost's Matthew Fox, likewise cast against type as the film's sadistic villain."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,33,"There's not a moment in Alex Cross that doesn't function splendidly as comedy. Which means that for all his cool-cat preening and heroic soul-searching, Tyler Perry must have felt right at home."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,30,What a whorish film this is: Even the serial killer lectures the detective.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,30,"It's a courageous but misguided move on Perry's part; he has none of Freeman's soulful, nuanced subtlety, and watching him display the gamut of emotions called for in Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson's script is like watching the Hulk attempt Swan Lake."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,30,"In the face of such junk, the idea that Fox would proudly put himself on a punishing regime of severe diet and exercise to get prisoner-skinny-yet-crazy-muscled for the job of make-believe is vanity at best, obscenity at worst."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,"Instead of playing the role in drag, the erstwhile Madea simply is a drag."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,Alex Cross is slipshod cinema hoping to capitalize on a star out of his orbit here.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,Formulaic serial-killer crapola.
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,25,"In drag or out of it, the soft-spoken star has rarely been less convincing than when locking and loading from his home arsenal or dangling from a decaying Detroit edifice."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"A grim, dispiritingly stupid waste of time, energy, money and talent."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"The best of the Alex Cross mess suggests that as an actor, he has the talent to move beyond the world of Madea should he want to. He just needs to look for much better material."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"The cross-dressing ""Madea"" star seems out of his depth playing the hard-boiled detective made famous by Morgan Freeman in ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls."" Even action helmer Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious,"" ""XXX"") seems to be off his game here."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,20,"The movie is stunningly perfunctory, soul-crushingly oblivious to its own lack of originality, and, to be blunt, just plain dumb."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,16,"Alex Cross is more boring than your average weeknight procedural, except much longer, dumber and more violent."
Alex Cross,5.1,25888412,16,"Expositional and often self-serious to the point of genuine awkwardness, the dialogue is never as haltingly unconvincing as when it's attempting to give some approximation of Alex Cross's essential looseness and good humor."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,80,Kawajiri's doom-laden action epic is a heady brew indeed.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,80,Dark fantasy triumphs in this gorgeously animated surrealist adventure.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,75,"A genre pastiche that's fun to watch, although it's also frustrating."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,75,"Beautiful, witty and provocative, this is one genre film that ought to appeal to fans and non-fans alike."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,75,"The animation is rich and densely detailed, the characters well defined."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,70,"If you appreciate fine animation and edgy material, this blood's for you."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,67,"As usual with anime features, just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids; heads roll and blood spurts, so know that going in, mom and dad. For the older crowd, though, it's gory and gorgeous bliss."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,67,"Exciting, gory, funny and, like much of anime, a bit cheesy."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,63,Confusing storytelling and bad dialogue.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,60,"Handsome, well-executed film that nonetheless feels a bit long at 111 minutes. Those who are already anime fans will certainly find it stimulating; but this may not be the one to convert the uninitiated."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,60,"Doesn't quite scale the heights it could and should, often because of its inappropriate humor, which could be blamed on cultural mistranslation."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,50,"It's a must-see for horror buffs and anime fans; and while it lacks the haunting thematic underpinnings of ""Blood The Last Vampire,"" -- it's a more satisfying movie-going experience."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,50,"A baroque, bloody fantasy-adventure that stubbornly remains less than the sum of its parts."
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,7.7,151086,50,"The film looks nifty, but the flat and unemotional English-language dialogue lessens its impact."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,83,"If you accept that Rambo is not the same kind of movie as First Blood and watch it on its own merits, it’s a badass action movie."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,75,"It may be a dishonest, xenophobic, exploitative act of historical revisionism, but it's effective, and Jack Cardiff's cinematography lends Rambo's comic-book adventures an epic sweep."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,75,"The body count is rising, Sly's pecs are blowing up, and Rambo himself is becoming more of a brand-name than a character, a mascot for masochism and murderous self-assertion."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,60,"The charade on the screen, which is not pulled off, is to accept that the underdog Rambo character, albeit with the help of an attractive machine-gun wielding Vietnamese girl (Julia Nickson), can waste hordes of Vietcong and Red Army contingents enroute to hauling POWs to a Thai air base in a smoking Russian chopper with only a facial scar (from a branding iron-knifepoint) marring his tough figure."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,60,"Here is a film fully xenophobic, abhorrent film, touting guileless version of military honour, but with Jack Cardiff’s furtive camerawork and some excellent editing, it sucks you in to its disturbing heroic sweep."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,Rambo is an inane sequel to a fairly good melodrama; another example of an attempt to repeat an earlier success that goes wildly out of scale.
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,"To anyone who doesn't share the camera's adoration, this sort of behavior becomes so comic that Rambo turns into something of a camp classic."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,"The picture seems deliberately trite, blunt, and manipulative, as if the producers didn't trust their audience to respond to anything else."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,40,"All in all, it's a pretty offensive movie, especially to the Americans who fought in Vietnam."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,75,"There are a lot of moments to remember in The Golden Child, but the one I will treasure the longest happens when Eddie Murphy gets behind the wheel of a beat-up station wagon and is led by a sacred parakeet to the lair of the devil."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,60,A non-movie that seems to wash over audiences without making any kind of impression. Except for those it does impress.
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"After his triumphant Beverly Hills Cop, Eddie Murphy could have done anything. Why, then, did he choose to head for the mysterious Orient to make a film as rich in mumbo jumbo as The Golden Child? Mr. Murphy's comic skepticism in the face of all this is the film's greatest asset. But it is worn thin by the awareness that not even he seems able to take the adventure seriously, and by the preposterousness and inconsistency of what surrounds him."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"As in Big Trouble, there is much playing around with oriental mythic nonsense: underground caverns, magic daggers, even a trip to Tibet. But where the movie really misses a trick is its inability to reproduce the balletic splendours of martial arts. The surprise is Murphy, who relies more on his undoubted charm than on the stream of wisecracks he usually delivers."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"A strange hybrid of Far Eastern mysticism, treacly sentimentality, diluted reworkings of Eddie Murphy’s patented confrontation scenes across racial and cultural boundaries, and dragged-in ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) special effects monsters, film makes no sense on any level."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,40,"The action sequences are cloddishly orchestrated. And for the most part, the movie simply doesn't make sense."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,40,"A weirdly out-of-scale movie that constantly juxtaposes the trivial and the cosmic, less to comic effect than to a mounting sense of muddle and uncertainty."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,38,"Toying with themes too serious for it and stars too big for it, this fantasy is incalculably less than the sum of it's parts."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,25,"Eddie Murphy's latest is a flabby disappointment. The jokes die, the action curdles. Much of it falls as flat as smashed tinsel."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,75,"Eraser is more or less what you expect, two hours of mindless nonstop high-tech action, with preposterous situations, a body count in the dozens, and Arnold introducing a new trademark line of dialogue (it's supposed to be ""Trust me,"" but I think ""You're luggage"" will win on points)."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,75,"Eraser may lack the chameleon wizardry of the the ""Terminator"" duo, or the imperious mechanics of ""True Lies"", but the bang-for-the-buck ratio is high enough to appease even the thinnest wallet."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,75,And the guy is really good at his job: He knows how to combine impossibly macho action plus attractive self-amusement into a reliable rhythm of ooof! and wink-wink.
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"You're not watching anything original, you're just reexperiencing elements you've seen in a jillion other spectacles (including ""Die Hard,"" ""True Lies"" and even ""Mission: Impossible""), only with more heat, more crash, more burn."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"A few of the set pieces are fussy or overly extended, but the rest is tolerable bone-crunching diversion."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"The hero's feats are implausible even by action standards, but screenwriters Tony Puryear and Walon Green have concocted one of the summer's most spectacular action sequences."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"It takes the usual chases, explosions, and shoot-outs, and places them in plot that involves all sorts of computerized and electronic gadgetry. Often, as is the case here, not much attention is paid to whether the ""science"" is technologically feasible, but if something looks and sounds neat, why not use it?"
Eraser,6.1,101295562,70,"However, despite having all the tried-and-true elements set firmly in place, Ah-nold's latest doesn't quite measure up to the action star's finest work, even if it should prove to be a mildly pleasing diversion for fans."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,63,"It's the typical elements that make Eraser no more than a solid bit of fluff: This is one of those movies where good guys don't miss, and bad guys can't shoot to save their lives."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,63,"What director Charles Russell (""The Mask"") and co-writers Walon Green (""RoboCop 2"") and Tony Puryear do right is supply the kind of non-stop action and laconic one-liners we live for in Arnold movies."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Eraser means to show off the star's standard persona against a backdrop of lavish special effects, which is certainly a formula that's worked before. But this is no ""Terminator,"" since its tricks are so much more arbitrary and over-the-top."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Compared with high-powered action specialists like James Cameron, director Charles Russell seems content to accomplish just one thing per shot, getting the essentials on the screen but creating no special dynamic or look."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Eraser does have a few big-ticket stunts that hold the attention, but director Charles Russell, fresh from ""The Mask,"" isn't able to infuse them with the intensity and believability that James Cameron brought to comparable sequences in ""True Lies."""
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"Derivative and utterly implausible, ERASER is big-budget action filmmaking at its dullest."
Eraser,6.1,101295562,50,"The picture is effectively made, but viewers will want to erase the horrific violence that erupts in scene after scene, leading to an unusually mean-spirited finale."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"In place of a rousing adventure, Blackthorn is a haunting ode."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Blackthorn imagines a scenario for Butch's later years and gives us a different kind of Western - somber, reflective and set in the elevated plains and salt flats of Bolivia."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Watching Shepard work his pony down a snaking mountain pass, playing a mandolin and singing the blues, or seeing him sitting, stone-still, beneath a railroad water tank, waiting for something to happen - these are scenes to be cherished, from an actor who has found the soul of the character he's playing."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Blackthorn is less interested in realism than in elegy, and in bringing this American folk hero in line with the Latin American places and people with whom he ended his days. Given a choice between the legend and the facts, Gil and Barros make up a new legend - and then gild it with light."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"With Paul Newman gone, you couldn't ask for a better senior-citizen representation of Butch Cassidy than Shepard. In his best performance since ""The Right Stuff'' turned him into a reluctant movie star, Shepard makes Blackthorn worth seeing."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,75,"Blackthorn could use more depth and less of a sense of weary inevitability, but it never lacks for the arid, vista-prone beauty of a classic Western, or for a sense of lived-in wear and tear that remains convincing even though it's more stylized than realistic."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,"There is that allure of the Old West that is hard to resist, and there's plenty of grist in the story worth milling and mulling."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,This modest oater should tickle western fans.
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,"The actor (Shepard) delivers a beautifully understated, world-weary turn that largely makes up for the slow-paced film's longueurs, and which in a better film could be described as iconic."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,70,"Shepard delivers in spades, his character weary but just crackpot enough to survive."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,67,"The film has a Leone eye (courtesy of cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchía) coupled with a drowsy, doomy pace which, emboldened by the salt-licked Bolivian settings and the finely calibrated acting from all, makes for a phantasmagoric trip down a strangely different memory lane."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"Shepard is the whole show here, as weathered and elemental as the harsh Bolivian locations; the movie's best scenes are those that pit him against Stephen Rea as a former Pinkerton man who tracked the outlaws for years and can't believe Cassidy is still drawing breath."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"It's a trenchant modern western and fans of the genre should embrace it for more reasons than just the presence of the epic Sam Shepard who, by the way, owns this Butch Cassidy."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"Director Mateo Gill's autumnal movie has elements of other late-era Westerns in its blood, but it isn't easily pigeonholed. There are shootouts and standoffs, as well as great scenes like one between the grizzled, perfectly cast Shepard and Rea discussing the cost of criminality and the changing morals of old men."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,60,"Gil's alternative history gets one thing bang-on right: If Butch were to live into his senior days, he'd absolutely have to be played by Shepard. Wrinkled, leathery and densely carpeted in a salt-and-pepper beard, the 67-year-old playwright and actor still exudes intellectual mischief and hard-stare sex appeal; his self-styled ruggedness is a perfect match for an infamous gringo living incognito."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,58,The result is a handsome but deeply fractured tale.
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,50,"The first-time director is Mateo Gil, known for the screenplays of ""Open Your Eyes,"" ""The Sea Inside"" and ""Agora."" Ironic, that the film's weakness is its screenplay."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,50,"The movie plods along self-consciously, and when the big twist occurs (you'll most likely see it coming), it complicates the plot, but not Butch, who remains a paragon. That's the problem with Blackthorn: it goes all mushy when contemplating its grizzled, out-of-time hero."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,38,"Blackthorn feels less like a proper sequel to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" which it purports to be, than a coattail rider."
Blackthorn,6.6,200558,38,"Blackthorn's last-man-standing circumstances, far from a cautionary tale about the cost of the gunslinger life, are glorified as the height of macho nobility."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,91,"It's a crackerjack B movie worthy of comparison to such stylishly low-down, smart-meets-dumb, hyper-violent entertainments as the 1997 Kurt Russell thriller ""Breakdown,"" Clint Eastwood's infamous police bloodbath ""The Gauntlet,"" John Carpenter's original ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" and Arnold's own overlooked 1986 outing ""Raw Deal."""
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,88,"One of its most refreshing aspects is its acceptance of both western and action-film conventions on their own terms, refusing to regard itself as operating outside of or superior to the genre."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,80,"There's savvy in Schwarzenegger's understanding of his appeal. Always foreign yet weirdly Americanized in our dreams, the big guy is a craggy monument in need of a countryside. He's back in the place that deserves him."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,75,"The Last Stand marks the American debut of the Korean director Jee-woon Kim, who delivers a half-dozen quality kills that will leave audiences squirming and then laughing at the sheer audacity of it all."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,75,"Dig just a shade beneath the surface, trade in the text for the subtext, and a more interesting picture emerges – a little richer, sadder, almost poignant. Arnie is back again, yet now, as a storied immigrant nearing the end of his tale, he's become an odd sight to behold."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,75,"It's a struggle at times, mostly because the action-movie clichés haven't been weeded out of the script, but the film is cheerfully, irresistibly destructive - an old-fashioned, ""Rio Bravo"" shoot-'em-up with the hicktown spirit of ""Tremors,"" though it isn't as good as either."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"It's an enjoyably old-fashioned shoot-out, if you can shake off the current headlines and sink in to a fantasy of hyper-violence that plays like an NRA vision of America the Beautiful."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"If that sounds like Schwarzenegger might actually be called on to act this time, you're right. And to his credit, this is the loosest the guy's been in ages. His amiable banter rarely feels forced, and even the obligatory jokes about his age feel genuine."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"The movie comes up with a couple of tender moments that could pass for human, and a mano-a-mano climax in which the superhero of yore, the glint in his eye dulled but not extinguished, functions as a weirdly touching tyrannosaurus."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"Johnny Knoxville offers comic relief as the goofball proprietor of a back-road gun museum, which conveniently allows for an odd assortment of weapons to be used in the climactic battle. It's that kind of movie."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,70,"Kim finally lets loose, and the imaginatively choreographed mayhem that ensues - culminating in two fast cars chasing each other across a pesky cornfield - can be a wonder to behold."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,67,"Despite his acknowledged age, creaking bones, and reduced nerve, Schwarzenegger still delivers quite a performance in this fun, straight-ahead action film."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,63,"The film, directed by South Korean Jee-woon Kim, hits all the necessary action beats and effectively blends in the humor."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,Kim Jee-woon's riff on the western is an entertaining frolic back-loaded with gore and guffaws. Arnie's back!
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,Arnie's toe-dip back into the action-cinema pool is a daft bit of fluff rather than a bruising mission statement. Get through the plot and you'll be rewarded with 30 minutes of whirligig mayhem.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,"Is it a coincidence that classic action is making its comeback at the same time Schwarzenegger is making his own? Hey, he warned us he'd be back."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,60,"The director does pull off a pretty magnificent cornfield car chase - two sleek vehicles cut through a thick, shaggy carpet of maize like souped-up harvesters, the movie's way of saying that the simple country life needn't be devoid of thrills. But Jee-woon takes too long to wrap things up, fumbling repeatedly on his way to an ending."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,58,"The bloodshed speaks volumes enough, though, even if it takes some time getting to the mayhem proper."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,58,The Last Stand delivers -- up to a point. Keep those expectations reasonable and try not to be disappointed.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"If only Kim had a sense of humor to match his visual wit.  Instead, we get rusted gags and rubbery acting."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"Kim doesn't sweat interweaving his story threads in any tightly controlled way. Just when the need-for-speed stuff really starts to gain traction, he'll shift for a surprisingly lengthy stretch to comic relief with the deputies and local wacko Johnny Knoxville."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"Sure, violence in movies isn't violence in real life. And when you combine it with intelligent dialogue and pointed social commentary (a la ""Django Unchained""), it can be cathartic. But The Last Stand, absent either of these things, just seems to want to gin up a lot of high-fiving for a lot of shooting, and right now is the least palatable time I can think of for that."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"Almost certainly, The Last Stand will not be Schwarzenegger's last. For better or for worse (and this is somewhere right in the middle), he is back."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"The idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a small town sheriff is ludicrous, but then that's the whole point of his new movie: It's dumb fun, emphasis on the dumb."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,50,"[The Director] is especially good at integrating his New Mexico locations into the action, from a key combat scene on a bridge to a car chase that unfolds, with limited visibility, in a cornfield...Kim's handling of his first English-speaking cast isn't quite as assured, although everyone more or less gets by"
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,So to call this a good movie is really a stretch; it's more like 38 percent of a good movie. But it probably has just enough dumb fun and pointless violence and car chases to seem like a highly viable option for large numbers of people this weekend.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,"The script is a mess, built on lazy clichés, stilted jokes and easy payoffs. What the movie does have, though, is enthusiasm."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,"The South Korean director Kim Jee-woon fails to dazzle with the endless speeding-car sequences, but that 60-second flourish during a lengthy firefight is almost worth the tedium."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,40,Not the worst but is very far from the best film the star has made in his career.
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,38,"It's a junky, crowd-pleasing movie of sidekicks – Guzman and Knoxville – bad acting, over the top shootouts, and catch phrases."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,38,"While the cast includes Luis Guzman (as a buffoonish deputy) and Johnny Knoxville (as a local gun nut), there's no sense that these are real people in a real town, and Schwarzenegger's Sheriff Owens has the weakest backstory of all."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,25,"The movie equivalent of an idiot who, to avoid scorn, starts acting like an even bigger idiot, so as to get in on the joke, too...It takes everything and nothing seriously, depending on what the filmmakers think they can get away with at any given moment, and the result, while not painful to watch, is ridiculous."
The Last Stand,6.4,12050299,25,That's the thing about this corpse pileup of an action movie. It persistently tries to drag the audience down to its mindless level.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,Director James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd (both of whom co-wrote the script) demonstrate their storytelling virtuosity.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,"A blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,"Getting the extraordinary physical specimen of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead was a stroke of genius and a stroke of fortune. Each of his pecs is the size of a bull’s flank. It is a tremendous black-comic performance and, without Schwarzenegger, the movie is of course unthinkable."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,"From the slam-bang direction to the relentless pace to the not-a-word-wasted dialogue and even the driving synth score, everything else about The Terminator just works."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind since The Road Warrior.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,91,It's a rousing science fiction story that proves an on-screen adrenaline rush.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,An amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,"When Terminator is not taking itself seriously -- and sometimes even when it is -- it's lots of fun. And filmmakers James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd don't drown us in blood, though it's not for the squeamish."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,"An efficient, cold-blooded sci-fi splatter movie that never makes the mistake of forgetting that on some level it is deeply ridiculous."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,"Those nightmares we’ve all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,88,"It's rather confusing. But in the context of this wildly imaginative movie, it's all, rather exciting, too."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,88,"Schwarzenegger is presented as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength--the image is more geological than human--and Cameron plays his crushing weightiness against the strangely light, almost graceful violence of the gunplay directed against him. The results have the air of a demented ballet."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,80,A B-movie with flair.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,88,"It's a pretty good ride even if it blatantly steals some of its best stunts from ""American Graffiti"" and ""Grease."""
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,75,"I found it more pleasurable as a time waster than either ""Mission: Impossible."""
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,63,This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,63,"The story is unbelievable and phenomenally silly, not a good combination."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,60,"This new version is mindless hot-rodding fun, especially for those with a weakness for vintage cars hurtling down city streets, a group whose members include -- sigh -- me."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,60,"This retread has been bloated far beyond its B-movie origins, beefed up with more characters and an all-star cast, stripped of any real suspense and loaded down with music cuts and one-liners aimed at pleasing a crowd of rowdy male teenagers."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,"The car stunts are ridiculous, all lightning-fast editing and computer enhancement -- by the time action is this far removed from reality, who cares?"
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,A time-waster with some enjoyably empty zip.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,So mired in his own ludicrous equation for contemporary action pictures that it's constantly stuck in first gear.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,"This film, a remake of a hapless 1974 cheapie of the same title, can't even get the big chase right."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,Interesting and idiotic elements almost exactly balance each other.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,42,"I'll tell you what's gone in 60 seconds, all right: my attention."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,"There were moments when I thought Gone in 60 Seconds might be a passably entertaining movie.  I figure those moments, strung end-to-end, would total 30 or 40 seconds."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,"It's barely a movie at all, more like a thousand car commercials spliced together in an hour."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,A 119-minute trailer.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,Written in 60 Seconds would be a more appropriate title.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,Doesn't just look and sound like a car commercial. It is a car commercial.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,38,It has a tendency to run ragged and spends an unhealthy amount of time idling pointlessly at intersections.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,38,"Eventually, the senses jam and a mental lube job is in order."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,"Proves a theory first advanced in the movie ""Repo Man"": The more you drive, the stupider you get."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,"A mindless, cliche-riddled action-cartoon, a blur of metal and fire and screeching tires, with bad dialogue, cardboard characters and a volume set so high, it makes the Indianapolis 500 sound like chamber music."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,How did a dignified pro like Duvall get stuck in this fender-bender?
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,Perfectly dreadful in every respect.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,100,"Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the finest movies yet from Marvel Studios, and a big departure in tone and storytelling from most of the films they've made so far.  It is a strong indicator that the more willing the studio is to experiment, the more exciting the payoffs can be."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,91,"Johnston and company are aware that introducing a hero means more than showing off his suit and gadgets or building up the universe he will eventually encapsulate. Before any of that, we must care about who he/she is."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,91,It gives you all that you could ask for when you buy a ticket to a thrill ride.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The movie surges ahead, moving nimbly through a series of action set-pieces that owe more to films like ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"" than they do to, say, ""The Green Hornet."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,Adding goofy uncertainty to shoulders as wide as the East River makes for a disarming hero in one of the spiffiest WWII action yarns ever to march out of Hollywood.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The best kind of comic-book movie. It's stylish and spectacular, yet it's rooted in history and human emotions. It's smart yet it's funny. It's wise yet it kicks ass when it has to. Just like the U.S. of A."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The most stylish comics-derived entertainment of the year...It's paced and designed for people who won't shrivel up and die if two or three characters take 45 seconds between combat sequences to have a conversation about world domination, or a dame."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Joe Johnston - returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort, ""The Rocketeer"" (1991) - creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting, and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Captain America isn't a masterpiece, but it's a solidly crafted, elegant adventure movie that held my attention from start to finish and sent me out into the street energized instead of enervated."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"This muscular, red-blooded adventure has a decent heart and the stuff of Saturday afternoon serials running through its veins."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Captain America is exactly what the third week of July needed: a curiously fun, surprisingly imaginative and unashamedly old-fashioned yarn of skulduggery and adventure."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"What really distinguishes Captain from the other superhero movies of 2011 (and quite frankly, the majority of the others released in the last several years) is a romance that feels like an integral - not incidental - component of the plot."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"What distinguishes Cap is his humble backstory, which involves neither hairy gods nor hot-dogging test pilots but a kid from Brooklyn who just wants to fight for freedom."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"While the story is preposterous and most of the cast standard-issue, it's hard not to like a comic-book movie that features both Busby Berkeley-style dance numbers and high-tech vaporizing weaponry."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"For the most part, it manages to balance laughs, genuinely rousing moments, and a fully packed agenda into something fleet enough to keep running under the weight of its rich ambitions."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Captain America might hold the most promise, not just of saving the world, but of saving comic book movies from themselves."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Succeeds where ""Thor"" didn't and the ""Incredible Hulk"" hasn't, twice. Unlike those drags, director Joe Johnston keeps things relatively simple and pleasantly stupid."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,It goes without saying it's preposterous. But it has the texture and takes the care to be a full-blown film.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Stolidly corny, old-fashioned pulp fun."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"The fourth comic book movie of the summer is the best comic book movie of the summer. Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump in the throat nostalgia."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Until the computer-generated effects bog it down and mess up its rhythms, Captain America: The First Avenger, has a measured, classical pace and a lot of good, old-fashioned craftsmanship."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"On its own, Captain America is a modestly engaging little-big movie in the median range: well below the first ""Iron Man,"" somewhat above ""X-Men: First Class."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Captain America is first and foremost an origins story. Almost half of the film's running time elapses before Rogers gets any kind of power at all, and though its elements are awfully familiar, it's the most involving part of the film because it takes advantage of Evans' performance."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Has a winningly pulpy, jaunty, earnest spirit."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Sticking to its simplistic, patriotic origins, where a muscular red, white and blue GI slugging Adolf Hitler in the jaw is all that's required, Captain America trafficks in red-blooded heroes, dastardly villains, classy dames and war-weary military officers."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Captain America falls into the prevalent pitfalls of origin stories. So much time and effort is expended explaining how the protagonist gains his super-powers (and exploring his initial usage of them) that there's not enough opportunity to develop a compelling storyline beyond his ""baptism."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"From its antagonists to its art direction, everything about Johnston's movie has a been-there, seen-that familiarity. Yet Evans' clean-cut idealism and objectives make old-fashioned patriotism look fresh."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,This is what the ongoing onslaught of comic book movies lacks: stars. Real stars. Robert Downey Jr. is the exception when he should be the rule. It's possible we take these movies for granted because the marketing tells us we should.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Here's the funny thing: Despite all the Captain America rah-rah in costume and indestructible shield, the movie is at its best when the story sticks with skinny Steve."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Tommy Lee Jones provides wisecracking levity as Rogers's commanding officer, Hayley Atwell supplies the aforementioned buxom chest and accompanying tough-girl grit as Rogers's British love interest, and Johnson directs with flair, his set pieces defined by both muscularity and clarity."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"The movie cleverly spins a meta-fictional ""origin"" myth for Captain America: explaining that he was in fact a propagandist comic-book superhero before becoming a real one. The final scene of the film, and Captain America's very last line, are rather brilliant – though admittedly less brilliant if their sole purpose is to set up sequels."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Captain America: The First Avenger is all utility. It has everything you might want from a movie of this kind — bangs, baddies, nonsensical backstories — except for the most important element of all: surprise."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Respect is due to Joe Johnston and his screenwriters for not only fashioning a nifty, highly entertaining slice of pulpy comic-book action, but for making this most divisive of costumed crusaders universally relatable."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Charming, handsome and full of pep – all 70 year-old Cap lacks is a knockout blow. Still, Johnston should be saluted for old-fashioned heart in a cynical age, while Marvel should be confined to barracks for cynical marketing."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"The old-fashioned vibe, in fact, does more than just distinguish the story of skinny runt turned supersoldier Steve Rogers (Evans) from every other comic-book movie out there, though its fetishization of retro-techno gizmos and getups-call it leatherbucklepunk-immensely adds to the fun."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"In the end, the action sequences are just overblown and dollar-squandering, with no particular payoff in the entertainment department. The supporting actors - particularly Jones, Tucci and Luke - are the thing to watch here; they do all they can to keep the movie's gears running smoothly."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,The final conflict is so protracted as to comfortably accommodate a bathroom break. Don't worry. You won't miss anything you haven't seen before.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"Is there any doubt Evans' Captain America will do exactly what the character created 70 years ago by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby did in the comics – kick Nazi butt? The real surprise will come next year, when we get to see how the super-square Captain adapts to 21st-century life."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"Evans – always a reliably dynamic and vivacious screen presence – can't do much to bring the character to life. As far as superheroes go, Cap remains a bit of a stiff."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"As Marvel heroes go, Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,40,"Once Captain America goes off to war in his endearingly silly suit, however, the movie starts to lose its vibe."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,40,"(A) hokey, hacky, two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging, complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,20,Captain America is simply awful. It is another hour and a half of prologue to the film people are apparently waiting for - The Avengers.
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,88,"For its first hour is as exciting an action picture as the Die Hard films. The tension and humor level tail off a bit toward the conclusion, but Steven Seagal and Chicago director Andy Davis clearly declare themselves as top-flight talent."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,75,"The formula is obvious: Die Hard Goes to Sea. I walked into the screening in a cynical frame of mind, but then a funny thing happened. The movie started working for me."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,75,"Under Siege is an immensely slick, if also old-fashioned and formulaic, entertainment. Steven Seagal fans and action buffs should eat up this taut suspenser, which is set entirely on board a battleship."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,70,"In the brutally efficient Under Siege, Seagal, with his soft-spoken nihilist charm, attempts to move beyond limb-snapping exploitation and into epically scaled mainstream thrillers. He succeeds — but only because this sort of slick action bash doesn’t require a star with much personality. At this point, personality might only get in the way."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,67,"Everything about the movie is overscaled, overbrutal, overbroad, full of holes. Yet there's something cheerful and wacky about it; it's a light-hearted blood bath."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,63,"This no-brainer is fine if all you're after a bit of escapism, but don't look for anything deeper than that."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"As wild as the premise is, Under Siege is almost guiltily enjoyable."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"An entertaining splasher film, Under Siege pits Casey Ryback (Seagal) against psycho terrorists Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones) and Krill (Gary Busey). As with most action films, viewers guessing the ending won't disappoint themselves, though the setting is certainly different from the usual urban decay of Seagal dramas. Everything is played out on the Missouri, which is actually the cleverly reconstructed USS Alabama. Would that such cleverness had been applied to the script, which has holes big enough to drive a submarine through."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"Davis handles the pacy action sequences confidently, with dark, claustrophobic interiors enhancing the suspense; so it's all the more disappointing when corny dialogue and barely-sketched characters let things down."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,60,"During its opening scenes, Under Siege threatens to achieve something like Die Hard's blend of wit, ingenuity and action, with Jones and Busey making highly entertaining, creepy-funny villains. Once the stolid Seagal takes over, however, we settle into a predictable high-tech groove of explosions, gunplay and gore."
Under Siege,6.5,83363139,50,"Ultimately, Under Siege isn't much because, basically, with Seagal as the star there's no real human center. But Davis, playing to Seagal's strengths, has woven a carefully crafted confection around the star, who has enough moves to hold it all together."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,70,"3 Ninjas Kick Back clearly was made with an eye on the international movie market. Set mostly in Japan and adding a female ninja to the three boys, this high-spirited adventure succeeds in conveying the positive and fun elements of both Japanese and American cultures."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,70,"Writer Mark Saltzman and director Charles T. Kanganis do a fine job of keeping things happening and moving in an easy yet highly kinetic fashion. Although aimed at children, this smart-looking TriStar release is actually more inventive and better-paced than many a comedy for adults."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,67,"Filled with martial-arts action, bathroom humor, and slapstick, 3 Ninjas Kick Back even has a politically correct kicker: The champion ninja is a girl."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,63,"Who was this movie made for? Not for me, that's sure, but I have a hunch younger kids will find it satisfying."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,50,"You don't have to be aligned with the forces of evil to despise this infantile, obnoxious sequel to 1992's surprisingly enjoyable 3 NINJAS."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,50,Although it is as harmless as its predecessor - and harmless should not be mistaken for a compliment - there is only one sad conclusion to be drawn from this kind of profiteering kiddie fodder: We owe our children better than this.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,40,A hectic free-for-all with no point at all.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,38,Junk food laced with testosterone.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,30,A veritable clinic in irritation. Just thinking about it irritates me deeply.
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,25,"Going from subplot to subplot illustrates the apathy that exists on every level of the filmmaking, from the screenplay to the fight choreography."
3 Ninjas Kick Back,4.5,11784000,25,"The movie brings no new material to the screen and banks on the fact that its underage audience has an unschooled memory. Don't insult your kids with this choppy, unimaginative film product."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,75,"Kid II is an enlightening experience. It teaches you a little about courage, mercy, and the zen of movie-cycle maintenance."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,70,"The plotline is classic Western morality-play stuff, with the goodies and baddies clearly delineated, but the set pieces are well constructed, and the whole thing is beautifully staged and shot."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,63,"There are scattered pleasures throughout the film due to its two lead performances, which are the equal of the work done in the original. It's just that with a few exceptions, the characters Miyagi and Daniel are forced into conflict with aren't worthy of their time."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,60,"Even as sequels go in this era of movie mega-series, The Karate Kid Part II peters out faster than most."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,50,"Macchio, for his part, is an obviously intelligent actor with terrific instincts. Still, this movie leaves a bit to be desired: much of the movie seems recycled, and there is precious little subtlety in the villains' characterizations. The film is also about 15 minutes too long, with far too many convenient plot devices."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,50,"Script delivers any number of wise old Eastern homilies. Anyone over the age of 18 is liable to start fidgeting when Macchio dominates the action, but then viewers beyond that advanced age are irrelevant with this film."
The Karate Kid Part II,6.0,115103979,50,"Karate Kid II doesn't give us any emotional movement in Daniel's character, or Miyagi's, or their relationship, either -- it just recapitulates them. The only character who changes in the story, in fact, is Sato, whom you couldn't care a fried fig about."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,100,"Despite its occasional shortcomings, From Russia with Love is still a terrific Bond entry. There's true chemistry between Connery's 007 and Armendariz's Kerim Bey, and it is all the more remarkable when considering that the Mexican actor was in great pain and living his final days while the shooting took place. His character's eventual fate is among the few in the Bonds to have a real emotional impact."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,91,"From Russia With Love has two of the sexiest images I’ve ever seen: the opening credits with the names projected on belly dancers’ writhing, whirling bodies, and the scene where a bare-chested, towel-clad Bond enters his bedroom and finds Tatiana Romanova in his bed. Images like that aren’t cute. They’re primordial."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"For my money, still the best Bond, with a screwball plotline that keeps the locales changing and the surprises coming—even when reason dictates that the picture should be over. Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw make a creepy pair, and Daniela Bianchi embodies the essence of centerfold sex, circa 1964."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"It may seem grainy and fusty compared to the all-action tongue-in-cheek spectaculars that came later, but it's the Bond closest to my heart."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"There's no point in trying to tell you all the mad, naughty things that take place — the meetings with mysterious people, the encounters with beautiful girls, the bomb explosions, the chases, the violent encounter of Bond with a helicopter, a motor boat race. Nor is there any point in trying to locate the various characters in the plot, all of whom are deliciously fantastic and delightfully well played."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,90,"An intentional heehaw at whodunits, an uproarious parody that may become a classic of caricature...Sophisticated? Well, not really. But fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed. And though the film will scarcely eradicate the sex and violence that encumber contemporary movies, it may at least persuade producers that sick subjects may be profitably proffered with a healthy laugh."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,89,"This film began the fine tradition of deviating from Ian Fleming's novels, which gave us the suave, sophisticated Bond over Fleming's monosyllabic misogynist."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,88,"From Russia with Love is among the most tightly-plotted of all the Bond films, and, as a result, is one of the shortest. It moves briskly, blending intrigue, romance, and action into an immensely satisfying whole."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,A cracking cold war story.
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,"Written with enough self-consciously campy humor to defuse the paranoid ideologies running rampant here, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is also acted with tongues held firmly in cheek."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,"From Russia with Love is a preposterous, skillful slab of hardhitting, sexy hokum. After a slowish start, it is directed by Terence Young at zingy pace."
From Russia with Love,7.4,24796765,80,"Despite being recognised as one of the better 007 films (and one laudably devoid of what would later become the formulaic Bond ending), number two in the series actually proves marginally less memorable than many of the others."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,88,"Clash of the Titans is a grand and glorious romantic adventure, filled with grave heroes, beautiful heroines, fearsome monsters, and awe-inspiring duels to the death. It is a lot of fun."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,75,"These fantastical He-Man epics were common in the early ’80s (Legend, Conan the Barbarian, and The Beastmaster were all variations of the same theme), and while Clash of the Titans remains one of the genre’s homelier entries, there’s no faulting a film this lovingly and aptly arcane."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,70,"The effects might not hold up, but the performances by the likes of Smith, Olivier and other classically trained British actors, as well as Ursula Andress, elevate this to something more than a throwaway fantasy adventure from the early '80s."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,60,"Clash of the Titans is profligate in its use of talented people who are not particularly at home in this sort of film, though they all pay serious attention to their work."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,50,"Despite its general failure, some scenes from Clash of the Titans remain memorable. Chief among them is the duel with Medusa, a scene that ripples with tension."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,50,"Titans forces all aspects of the movie except the spectacle into the background, and historical accuracy isn't much of a concern. It does feature a better-than-average cast, however, aside from uncharismatic star Harry Hamlin."
Clash of the Titans,6.9,41092328,50,"Clash of the Titans is an unbearable bore that will probably put to sleep the few adults stuck taking the kids to it. Desmond Davis directs with a tired hand, not helped much by the lackadaisical writing."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,75,"The Gauntlet is classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny. It tells a cheerfully preposterous story with great energy and a lot of style, and nobody seems more at home in this sort of action movie than Eastwood."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,70,"The well paced script is an effective mixture of worldliness and naïveté: despite the couple's graphic sparring scenes, in which Eastwood more than meets his match, their relationship remains curiously innocent; a kind of fugitive romanticism pervades."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,70,"Vicious and hypocritical as it is, The Gauntlet remains an entertaining sort of disreputable show, considerably more proficient and interesting than junk melodramas in a dogged vein."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,63,"It is a movie without a single thought in its head, but its action sequences are so ferociously staged that it's impossible not to pay attention most of the time."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,63,"In a major role reversal, Clint Eastwood stars in The Gauntlet as a person who might be on the receiving end of the violence epitomized in his famed Dirty Harry film series."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,60,"It's telling that the film is still only truly memorable for the closing five minute bulletfest, which turns Clint's bus into the only thing with more holes in it than the screenplay."
The Gauntlet,6.4,35400000,60,"The violence is bloody, nonstop, and as pointless as the script."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,88,"A first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,88,It's a popcorn-movie deluxe.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,78,"The Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies, a ridiculously overblown summer testosterone blowout right down to the Wagnerian strains of the soundtrack and its stunningly high body count. It's also a hell of a lot of fun."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"The borrowings from other movies, going all the way back to the car chase in 1968's Bullitt, are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"Although not as expertly-crafted as ""Die Hard"" or ""Speed,"" The Rock is exhausting in its own right -- and that's just one of several convincing reasons to see this film."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"A raucous, in-your-face, commando-style action thriller that makes provocative use of Alcatraz as a lunatic's lair and San Francisco as a sitting duck."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"Bay has two great assets in Connery and Cage. The special effects give The Rock a James Bondian feel so Connery's wry, world-weary devil-may-careishness looks right at home here."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie Mission: Impossible should have been."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"High-octane nonsense but gives both the actors and the audience all that's needed to make this diverting--car chases, wisecracks, narrow escapes, explosions."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"Seldom is it clearer that a film is nothing more than high-gloss jokey escapism, or that when visual cliches are this relentless they become weirdly fascinating in their own right."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"This is a pure popcorn picture that benefits heavily from its trio of highly skilled, charismatic leading thesps, an unusual setting that provides plenty of visual stimulation, and a confrontational standoff that actually stems from a legitimately provocative premise."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,67,Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage inject tasty bits of personality into their roles.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,63,"Connery and Cage are a compelling team and redeem the film from ruin despite the mechanical plot, an excessive body count and a miraculous recovery (you'll know it when you see it)."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,63,[Cage] cracks wise throughout the third act and is almost entertaining enough to make this absurdly energetic movie recommendable.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"Cage proves his versatility as the reluctant hero (designed by way of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character), bringing his comic timing and droll face into perfect pitch. His first scene with Connery is giddy fun. He steals the entire picture."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"Slick and forceful, largely unconcerned with character, eager for any opportunity to pump up the volume both literally and metaphorically, The Rock is the kind of efficient entertainment that is hard to take pleasure in."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"The presence of Connery is pure balm, purring those Celtic tones like smoky single-malt Scotch."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,The Rock is just typical big American dumb fun.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"If it's not the most awful thing I've ever seen, it's close enough to make me wince."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"A violence-intoxicated, far-fetched, morally corrupt drama."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"It's an action junkie's angry fix -- 130 minutes of sound and fury, signifying nothing but big bucks and boundless contempt for viewer intelligence."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"If, at odd moments, The Rock is better than tolerable, it is usually because of its stars."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,30,"Can a mild-mannered toxicologist and an eccentric Alcatraz veteran stop him before it's too late? Learning the answer means sitting through more than two hours of violence, vulgarity, and all-around excess, served up with high-tech trimmings by director Michael Bay."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"If I were nine years old, I would see the monsters-versus-robots adventure Pacific Rim 50 times. Because I'm in my forties and have two kids and two jobs, I'll have to be content with seeing it a couple more times in theaters and re-watching it on video."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"Pacific Rim gives big, dumb and loud an exemplary name and summer audiences something to cheer."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"There’s no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry in this epic battle between massive lizard-like monsters and 25-story-high robots operated by humans."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"At first, watching Pacific Rim feels like rediscovering a favourite childhood cartoon – but del Toro has flooded the project with such affection and artistry that, rather than smiling nostalgically, you find yourself enchanted all over again."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,90,"This is a noisy, chaotic, technology-crazed 21st-century action film, but also one made with tremendous excitement, vigor and heart, along with a myriad of wonderful details."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,90,"Guillermo del Toro is more than a filmmaker, he's a fantasy visionary with an outsized imagination and a fanatical specificity, a creator of out-of-this world universes carefully conceived down to the smallest detail. His particular gifts and passions are on display in the long-awaited Pacific Rim and the results are spectacular."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,88,"Pacific Rim is, hands down, the blockbuster event of the summer — a titanic sci-fi action fantasy that has been invested, against all expectations, with a heart, a brain, and something approximating a soul."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,"Every monster-movie archetype is here, from nerdy scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) to hard-stare leaders (Idris Elba) with a penchant for 11th-hour inspirational speeches. (Watching the former Stringer Bell bellow about “canceling the apocalypse!” is one of those great, giddy pleasures you didn’t know you needed.)"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,"A huge, CGI-heavy popcorner that still feels personal. Come for the epic monster-on-mecha showdowns, stay for the likeable humans."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,It is one of the better dumbass sci-fi action movies to come down the pike in quite some time.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,Pacific Rim is big and dumb in a smart way.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Director Guillermo del Toro knows that the charm in the clash of scale - or armor-plated titans isn't necessarily tied to the low budgets and laughable production design of those guilty-pleasure TV shows. And with Pacific Rim, he cracks the code."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Of all this year’s loud, over-long summer action movies that, in various ways, simulate the experience of having a tin bucket placed over your head and being struck repeatedly with a stick, it must be said that Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim is by far the most entertaining."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"What pulls us over the rough spots is the mind meld between del Toro the artist and the child inside him. They both want to astonish us. Geeks everywhere, salute."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Pacific Rim shares much with the Mexican filmmaker's ""Hellboy"" franchise - jokey and comic book-y, full of muscular tableaus with huge squads of people coming and going (and running for their lives)."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Idris Elba exudes the requisite militaristic authority as Raleigh's commanding officer, and Rinko Kikuchi is his determined partner in mecha mayhem."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"There's not a single original moment to be found in Pacific Rim's 130-minute running time, but that doesn't much matter because the familiar beats are conveyed with maximum expertise intended to provide a visceral experience."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"It's closer to the hammering ""Transformers"" aesthetic than expected. Yet the weirdness around the edges saves it from impersonality."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Yet for all its expensive grandeur, almost too epic even for the vast canvases of IMAX, Pacific Rim is unmistakably a Del Toro creation."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"It is a ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like a gigantic version of that “Rock ’Em, Sock ’Em Robots” game from the 1960s, combined with the cheesy wonderfulness (or should it be wonderful cheesiness?) of black-and-white Japanese monster movies from the 1950s."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"Coming out of Pacific Rim I felt energized rather than enervated, excited to describe certain nifty details of the film’s wacked-out imaginary world to friends, maybe even ready to … sit through certain parts again?"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"Pacific Rim, with its carefree blend of silliness and solemnity, is clearly the product of an ingenious and playful pop sensibility."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"It’s not the best movie of the summer, not by a long shot, but if there’s such a thing as smarter dumb fun, this is probably it."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"To kill time between action set-pieces, del Toro has done an above-average job of avoiding tedium via some flavorsome casting, passably interesting plot contrivances and, above all, by maintaining strong forward momentum. Unlike so many similar crash-bang action spectaculars, this one feels lean and muscular rather than bloated or padded; the combat is almost always coherent and dramatically pointed rather than just splashed on the screen for its own sake."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,There’s no denying Pacific Rim is the best film of its kind. It remains to be seen whether the film’s epic clawing and clanking satisfies a pent-up demand equal to its ambitions.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,"In a sense, Pacific Rim winds up being not enough of a Guillermo del Toro movie. It's more like a mash-up of ""Real Steel"" and the ""Transformers"" pictures. Which is a shame, because the idea is undeniably cool."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,"Too in love with itself to ever totally go off the rails, Pacific Rim doesn't qualify as the first full-on dud of del Toro's career, but it's hard not to get the sense that something's missing."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"A big, lumbering, rock ’em, sock ’em mash-up of metallic heft and hyperbole, a noisy, overproduced disaster flick that sucks its characters and the audience down a vortex of garish visual effects and risibly cartoonish action. And you know what? It’s not bad!"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"It’s the cinematic equivalent of a kid playing with his toys and smashing action figures together, except del Toro does it with more grace and imagination than most. There are long sequences in this movie that merit that most overused of terms, “awesome.”"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"The movie is an eyeful, especially in 3-D, but even with humans at the helms of the machines, it’s a hollow exercise in homage."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"Del Toro’s robots have weight and mass, and their epic, Hong Kong-smashing fights with the four and six-legged, clawed and horned monsters are visually coherent, unlike the messy blur of the “Transformers” movies. There’s a light, humorous feel to “Pacific Rim” because the science is silly and logic takes a flying leap."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"Guillermo del Toro doesn't rise above the obligations of staging a film of this sort as a multi-level video game, a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"Pacific Rim never amounts to more than the sum of its setpieces, but it delivers on the promise of its premise."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"If Del Toro is pitching for an audience of 12-year-old boys (and we do mean boys: this is old-school macho), he’s done a bang-up job. Still, there are times when Pacific Rim could be the work of any jobbing Hollywood director – the warmth and idiosyncracy that characterises Del Toro’s finest work, from Pan’s Labyrinth to Hellboy 2, is absent."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,Pacific Rim's wafer-thin psychodrama and plot-generator dialogue provides little for the human component to get their teeth into.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"Del Toro is giving scope to a boyhood lust for mayhem, the multi-million-dollar equivalent of kicking over sandcastles and torturing insects. There is something infectiously juvenile in that."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered — long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"The Kaijus make zombies look like wusses, so at least the fights in this film are battles royal. But overload sets in early, and it all turns into battle boring."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"Pacific Rim made me marvel at the technology of movies, but never the magic of them."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"""Could be worse"" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of Pacific Rim, but my head is still ringing, and hurting, from long stretches of this aliens vs. robots extravaganza that are no better than the worst brain-pounders of the genre."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,You get 45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"All performances remain irrelevant in the face of such expensive, explosive combat and destruction, and there the film excels: You will feel blown back into your seat, starting 40 seconds into the story."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,42,"If your basic movie needs demand a little bit more -- logical premises; interesting, marginally original characters; dialogue that doesn’t reek of throaty, aspirational monologue after monologue -- Pacific Rim will leave you feeling hollow and wanting."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,40,"Although assembled with consummate care and obsessive attention to visual detail, Pacific Rim manages only fitful engagement and little in the way of real wonderment, suspense or terror."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,38,The story's appeal is lost in all the fights between the monsters and robots.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,25,If this is the best we can do in terms of movies - if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences - maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,25,"An hour and 20 minutes into this two-hour-and-11-minute endurance test, a hungry Kaiju attacks the city of Hong Kong and eats the neon signs of every Cantonese restaurant in Victoria Harbor. It’s sort of worth waiting around for."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,20,"Laudable as its world-building is, the film drags not just in its interminable middle hour, but also during the redundant monster-on-mechawarrior smackdowns."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,63,"Leisurely and overly familiar pic should appeal to young teen girls, but won't be breaking any B.O. bricks with its bare hands."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,This film feels like a desperate attempt to squeeze a few last bucks out of what was once a very obliging cash cow.
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"The fourth film in the series, the newest installment has a new director, Chris Cain, and a female Kid, Hilary Swank, but otherwise it reprises the formula established by John G. Avildsen in 1984: A troubled teen conquers self-doubt and the local bullies with the help of an enigmatic karate teacher."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"If this installment is just slightly less laborious than Karate Kid II or III, it's not from Mark Lee's surprise-free script or Christopher Cain's placid direction, but because young Swank really might be a find. Early on, she's such a convincingly testy teen that parents may flinch, but she does seem to blossom before your eyes."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"Overlong and utterly predictable, The Next Karate Kid offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,"Clearly, three sequels haven’t improved Miyagi’s English, but there is something bitchin’ about seeing a babe give a bully a good thwack. Not that girls will go see this or boys will care."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,50,Almost a guilty pleasure. But not quite.
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,42,"There's really nothing new here (as if anyone expected there would be), but it's a decent enough entry into the Karate Kid series, if you don't mind having seen it all done before, and better."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,40,"The Next Karate Kid is harmless as children's entertainment, but for 104 very long minutes, there isn't a recognizable human being in sight."
The Next Karate Kid,4.4,8914777,40,It should be obvious to anyone at this point in time that Kid is getting a little long in the tooth. As Miyagi might say: Those who keep milking same idea . . . end up killing cash cow.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all—or, anyway, more than enough to transport moviegoers back to the dazzling, thrill-sated matinee idyls of old. It is surely the best two hours of pure entertainment anyone is going to find in the summer of '81."

Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be. What is it? An adventure film that plays like an old-time 12-part serial that you see all at once, instead of Saturday-to-Saturday. It's a modern ""Thief of Baghdad."" It's the kind of movie that first got you excited about movies when you were a kid."

Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,68,"Assassin’s Creed’s creators have the courage to always take themselves seriously, even when they’re working with material that sounds fundamentally silly. There’s no great leap of faith in Assassin’s Creed, but a surprising amount of the time, it at least finds steady footing."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,67,"Declaring Assassin’s Creed to be the best video game movie ever made is the kind of backhanded compliment that sounds like hyperbole, but the description fits the bill on both counts. Regardless of what you call this peculiar, arrestingly uninviting nonsense, the fact of the matter is that it’s the only blockbuster of 2016 that left me desperate for a sequel."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,63,"By showing signs of intelligent life in a universe of diseased, digital drivel, Assassin's Creed stands above the herd of movies based on video games by default."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,63,"It also has great momentum, good set pieces, and so much frothy nihilism it’s just plain fun."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Assassin's Creed will be polarizing, but it's fascinating as an entry in Kurzel's oeuvre. It is singularly his film — both in style and the obsession with hubris, power and violence."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"The frenetic action is Assassin’s Creed’s saving grace. Inventively choreographed and beautifully executed, its game-inspired brand of wushu-meets-parkour delivers some genuinely awe-inducing feats."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Assassin’s Creed makes you actively work for its pleasures, and it’s heartening to see a film of this scale that’s strange and ambitious and doesn’t spoon-feed viewers every little detail."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"The relentless gloom can feel oppressive, but there’s plenty of ambition here, especially in the layered storytelling and woozy sense of time and place, with plenty of soaring aerial shots that nod quietly to the all-seeing eye of a computer game."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Valiant, but flawed. Some of the set-pieces are superb, but there isn’t enough meat on the bones to turn this into a classic."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"Obtuse, narratively incoherent, and ultimately frustrating, it stands as another example of how hard it is to make a good mainstream movie out of a popular computer game."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"The effect is less video-game-turned-movie than zombie movie minus zombies: stilted, static, s-l-o-o-o-w. The ending couldn’t set up a sequel more clearly if “To be continued” appeared on a title card. Don’t count on it. Game on? Game over."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,The picture has an undeniable rough stylishness...but in terms of coherence of storytelling it leaves the audience choking on all that swirling dust.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"What saves this head-scratching, relentlessly portentous movie is what also saves the games: the action is on point."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,It’s incrementally more fun than it is silly.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"Assassin’s Creed is nearly wall-to-wall violence, but Kurzel reveals an eye for widescreen composition that, paired with Christopher Tellefsen’s efficient, hyperactive editing, gives the film the tenor of a sophisticated graphic novel."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,Assassin’s Creed bears a jumbled narrative and self-serious approach that ends up feeling far too assaultive on the senses without any genuine pay-off.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,42,"The movie is at least interestingly confusing until about the halfway mark, when monotony sets in for good."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,42,It’s all window-dressing for an ending that reveals this alternately goofy and self-serious big-budget Hollywood product to be little more than a two-hour prelude to a potential future franchise.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,40,"Assassin’s Creed is leaps and bounds ahead of kitchen-sink-hurling flapdoodle like X-Men Apocalypse – it’s only the second-worst Fassbender star vehicle of 2016 – but it never allows him a sober moment, as that film did in a hushed Polish forest, where his talent, as opposed to his biceps, gets a stern workout."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,40,"In Assassin’s Creed, Michael Fassbender is like the ultimate special effect. Just by showing up, he confers respectability on two hours of semi-coherent overly art-directed video-game sludge."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,Never before have such acting heavyweights been so misused on screen.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,"Unlike the actual video game, Assassin's Creed isn't ridiculous and fun, but rather ridiculous and turgid."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,"Quest or no quest, cool locations or green screen soundstages, shirtless Fassbender or Fassbender in an assassin’s hoodie, “Assassin’s” never breaks the creed of Hollywood filmed video games — “Action packed, but dull.”"
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,Any fans hoping that Assassin's Creed would break the long streak of poor video game adaptations are bound to be disappointed by this nearly incomprehensible mess.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"Another entry in a long line of good video games adapted into terrible movies, Assassin’s Creed is ragingly stupid. That its incoherent plotline is treated with the utmost reverence by skilled thespians only brings its idiocy into sharper relief."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"For an ostensible action movie, the cast spends an awful lot of time standing around and looking lost. I can only guess that they were following their director’s lead."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"The acting offers little relief. Fassbender gives a super serious performance in a movie that needed his natural sense of humor. Playing his Abstergo doctor, Cotillard's accent is so bizarre and disconcerting, it's impossible to believe she’s the same actress who’s been so amazing in everything else she's done. As for Jeremy Irons, who plays her scientist father, it's hard to imagine this is anything more than a payday."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"Assassin’s Creed is resolutely stone-faced, ditching the humdrum quips that are par for the course in today's blockbusters. But this is almost two hours of convoluted hokum that might have benefited from a few self-deflating jabs."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,The Assassin's Creed movie is about all the parts you might skip in the games.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,The plot is that most dreadful of mixes: both laughably silly and needlessly complicated.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,Assassin’s Creed the movie is fairly innocuous. It’s also cheerless and dumb.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"Here’s a film that turns Michael Fassbender into a puppet, and oh, those strings hold him down."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"It's just a mediocre action movie, poorly edited and larded with a terrible musical score, based on a video game. Nothing new there."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"As might be obvious, I’m not a gamer, so perhaps all of this will be thrilling for fans who’ve played it. The rest of us, I imagine, may come out of this film invigorated with a creed of our own: Avoid movies based on video games."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,20,"Assassin’s Creed is a dour, lifeless film that leaves those familiar with the material perplexed, and those ignorant of it downright clueless."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,20,It’s rare to see a film quite so lacking in animus. It exists only to gouge money out of gamers. They might well want to stick to the game.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,12,The film ends up with both blurry action that often looks digitally faked and a fractious plot that’s stuck over-explaining itself.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,10,"I suppose you could say the film made me slightly more likely to play one of the games, but only because I’d do just about anything before I saw this movie again."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,90,A cunning and hilarious update of the giant-insect movies of the 1950s.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,80,"This is postmodern folk art, a tricky transaction in which the work isn't just a story, it's a genre survey, a homage, a meditation, a parody and, oh yeah, while it's at it, still a pretty good story."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Has laughs, thrills, wit and scary monsters, and is one of those goofy movies like ""Critters"" that kids itself and gets away with it."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"The cheesier it got, the more I liked it."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Eight Legged Freaks is a B-movie-and-proud-of-it thrill ride, probably the best of its kind since ""Tremors."" It does just what a good creature feature is supposed to do: It entertains with laughs, gasps, gooey spectacle and a bemused sense of fun."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"The movie's combination of unabashedly fun carnage, cool special effects, and tongue-in-cheek dialogue keeps the ball rolling (albeit at reduced speed), until the last of the titular terrors has bit the dust."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Doesn't try to be anything it's not. It's happy being a funny, shoot-'em-up, run-for-your-life, green-guts monster movie. And as green-guts monster movies go, it's a beaut."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,75,"Has a smart mix of things going for it, including a self-effacing sense of humor."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,70,It's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,70,So why does Eight Legged Freaks make one laugh out loud even though there is nothing revolutionary about its approach to the giant bug genre? -- the movie is so unapologetic in its crassness that it disarms even the fussiest connoisseur of throwaway disaster flicks.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,70,"Indeed, for all its jokiness, this isn't the film for anyone who suffers from even the mildest fear of ugly, scuttling, jumping creatures with spindly, furry legs that have a habit of hiding in your shoes."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,Starts like a house afire and then suffers an imagination burnout.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,"If you go to Eight Legged Freaks expecting anything but a campy, cheesy romp, then you have wandered into the wrong theater. This movie is for those who like smart (often self-referential) humor and cheap thrills."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,"Even at its most enjoyable, Eight Legged Freaks is disappointing -- it grazes your funny bone instead of tickling it like crazy."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,63,"This update of 1950s drive-in sci-fiers finds the right balance between icky, funny and scary, with sheer energy compensating for a script that could have used more parodic panache."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,60,"Silly, good-natured and thoroughly unpretentious, this giant-spider movie has nothing more on its mind than providing the kind of brainless thrills once delivered by movies like Tarantula (1955), Earth vs. the Spider (1958) and The Giant Spider Invasion (1975)."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,60,The people behind Eight Legged Freaks were absolutely correct not to make it too loopy or too dark. But they ought to have made it too something. Real fun is never this tame.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,58,An occasionally charming mix of campy fun and dodgy computer-generated effects.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"So if you're in the mood for a scary flick, the kind where people can't resist going into the huge hole in the wall where the family Pekinese just disappeared to the sounds of being masticated, this is the one."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,This movie stunk so much you’d think that there were barking spiders in the theater.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Like many of the worst pop-referential parodies of the post-''Scream'' era, this one stalls on laughs once the big joke has been established."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Neither particularly funny nor especially scary. But it's so cheerfully silly, you may just have fun with it anyway."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,Isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price.
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Winds up a lot closer to the movies it's taking off from than it cares to admit: cheap, unimaginative and predictable. It's the horror movie equivalent of one of those ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches that drags on interminably, though nobody in it seems to have any idea of just what the joke is."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"Awkward, obvious and sporadically -- very sporadically -- amusing."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,50,"The few isolated funny moments, particularly a witty visual gag involving a pop-up tent with legs, provide only a short break from the screen-flooding onslaught of CGI creatures and screaming extras."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,40,"Amid numerous identical skirmishes with leapfrogging arachnids, trace elements of black comedy and intentional camp are discernible but utterly extraneous."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,40,"The actual movie is the cinematic equivalent of cheap Chinese egg rolls: all flour and cabbage shreds, maybe half a nibble of pork."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,30,"Limps along, spinning not a silken web but an extremely derivative, tattered one not likely to snare anybody's interest."
Eight Legged Freaks,5.4,17322606,30,"Action freaks may enjoy the chasing and chomping, but there's no hint of human interest or moviemaking imagination."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,70,"Konchalovsky handles the slam-bang action with robust efficiency, but what makes this shoot-'em-up nonsense surprisingly watchable is Randy Feldman's rapid-fire dialogue, which constantly undercuts the macho posturings while parodying Stallone's screen image...even though the spectacularly empty finale eschews character-based comedy in favour of Bond-style megabuck explosions and gadgetry."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,60,"Stallone and Russell play well off each other, and with Palance lurking in the background, this buddy-breakout never loses its way."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,60,"The plot is a recycled mess, the dialog is awful, and the character motivation is nil, but thanks to Konchalovsky (and a strong performance by Russell), Tango and Cash is not only bearable, it's likable. Responsible for some of the finest films of the 80s, the Soviet-born director brings an insane, kinetic energy to the film that makes for effective action sequences and potent satire. A very smart ""dumb"" movie."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,60,"Tango and Cash is loaded with sweating, straining, smashing and grunting, with bulging-bicep shots and sadistic special effects. Watery electrocution sequences are a particular favorite, since these mean wet clothes, shooting sparks, writhing bodies and other current staples of high style. Images like these are so all-important in Tango and Cash that the idea of storytelling has virtually been annihilated."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"The ostensible humor here is of the macho one-liner variety, and much of it falls flat. There is just too much Ratso and Cowboy for us to believe in Butch and Sundance."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"As written by Randy Feldman and produced by the Batman team of Jon Peters and Peter Guber, Tango & Cash clearly wasn't meant to be interesting. It was meant to be Lethal Weapon-that is, a high-tech, ultra- violent, brain-dead buddy cop movie. In Konchalovsky's hands, however, Tango & Cash is more than interesting. It is, in fact, really weird."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"Tango & Cash is a mindless buddy cop pic, loaded with nonstop action that's played mostly for laughs and delivers too few of them. Inane and formulaic, the film relies heavily on whatever chemistry it can generate between Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, who repeatedly trade wisecracks while facing life-or-death situations."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"The jokes seem lame and the rivalry fraudulent, as the two boys play with their big guns."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,50,"Russell is an inoffensive Mel Gibson clone here. But Stallone is an unlovable lummox, preposterous because he takes himself so seriously. Even when he attempts to laugh at himself, his quips fall like clods on coffins. His bravery is braggadocio. Let's hope this will be the last of Tango."
Tango & Cash,6.4,63408614,40,"However gaudy its credits, it is one more--and one of the worst written--in an endless line of clenched-up, crashed-out, buddy-buddy L.A. cop star vehicles. A waste of talent and energy on all levels."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,90,The film is a strictly no-bull proposition.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,80,"The movie remains engaging, with a couple of sequences verging on stunning."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,80,"By turns morally compelling and racially paternalistic, this provocative drama may be the first halfway truthful war movie to hit multiplexes since ""Three Kings."""
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Fuqua takes a genre picture and, by diverting the story onto an unconventional path, generates a sense of urgency. Tears of the Sun is not a great movie, but it is satisfying, and represents an example of accomplished filmmaking."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Whenever its noble aims miss, Bruce Willis saves it."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Fuqua and his writers, Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo, have delivered not only the most satisfying and plausible action movie in months but one that's accidentally timely."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"Until it descends into mindless routine action in the climactic scenes, Tears of the Sun is essentially an impressionistic nightmare."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,75,"The film would be just as powerful, if less likely to saturate suburban megaplexes and flatter its patrons, were its saviors -- I don't know - French."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,70,"This is an odd amalgam of bleeding-heart sentimentality and over-the-top guts-and-glory action. You're not sure how to feel. But you're certainly not as moved and stunned as you were in ""Black Hawk Down."""
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,70,"Left wing? Right wing? Center? Who cares, as long as Bruce Willis is saving the world."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,67,"Fairly entertaining and often exciting, expertly done in a way, but not especially engaging or new, and not as emotionally involving as its title suggests."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,63,A schizoid action flick bogs down in lofty intentions.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,60,This is one of those pictures that unavoidably becomes part of the zeitgeist due to its coincidental arrival at a precise moment in history when its themes play into current events.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,60,What pushes it above mediocrity is that it ends better than it begins.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Despite the busy camera work, bombastic score and rapt attention to violence, director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) can't mask the script's white-savior paternalism."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"In a movie with so much graphic suffering by innocent Africans, its a bit disconcerting that so much loving attention is paid to Bruce Williss anguished mug. Theres an uncomfortable Great White Father (and Mother) aspect to this movie."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Fuqua has made three films before his newest, Tears of the Sun, and they've all begun well enough but then collapsed under the weight of his heavy-handed visual technique and his indifference to plot, character and logic."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"May make you weep, but not in the way anyone intended. Handsomely made, well-meaning but finally frustrating and unsatisfying, this perplexing film is an example of a previously unseen hybrid, the socially conscious, humanitarian action movie. It doesn't appear to be a genre with much of a future."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"At times, you could actually mistake Tears of the Sun for a blunt modern parable instead of an opportunistic mixture of up-to-the-minute atrocities and old-fashioned corn."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Tried to turn this into a replay of its 2000 military-rescue hitBlack Hawk Down -- though, in the end, it's almost totally lacking in the serious hardware and viscerally paced action that propelled Ridley Scott's movie to the top of the box office."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,It's simplistic and reactionary and designed to get hearts pumping but not minds thinking.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"The fiction that follows can be safely regarded as much more than a war movie -- hell, this is a pro-war movie. Were it a politician, it would be Donald Rumsfeld."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Unfortunately, it's not one-tenth as interesting as what you can see at home during a nightly cable surf as U.S. war policy is debated."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"The result is hardly a subtle film, but it has a stronger sense of combat's real costs and consequences than more sensationalistic pictures like ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" provide."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"Has honorable aspirations, even as it becomes mired in mainstream movie conventions."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,50,"For a film so intent on the rules of engagement, this is hardly engaging drama."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,42,"There's a fine line dividing Hollywood tradition and overly manipulative junk, and Tears of the Sun crosses it."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,40,"Aside from a few routine battle scenes, the movie's action consists mostly of people slogging slowly through non-stop rain. This is not interesting, much less exciting. The dialogue is hokey hero blather."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,40,A preposterous action movie in which a Navy SEAL makes the world safe for democracy one continent at a time.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,38,"Unfortunately, the movie's real setting is a sentimental fantasy world, and its story is a spectacularly incoherent exercise in geopolitical wish fulfillment."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,30,"Impossible to swallow as truth, this Rambo treatment is equally hard to enjoy as escapism."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,30,"Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) can stage action, but he can't save a trivializing, reactionary script featuring a Hollywood star (read America) as a global savior."
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,25,Its as deadly dull as the blunt end of a rifle.
Tears of the Sun,6.6,43734876,20,"This ""Black Hawk Down"" theft is a trial by cliché until the climax, which suggests a dress rehearsal for the torching of Baghdad."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,70,"There are a lot of things in Billy Jack that are seriously conceived and very well-handled. Some of the scenes at the school, for example, with real kids experimenting with psychodrama, are interesting. Some of the action scenes are first-rate. But the movie has as many causes in it as a year's run of the New Republic."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,63,Screenplay attempts to encompass too many story facets. Result is that the action frequently drags.
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,50,"Billy Jack is a film of violent contradictions. It is a fortysomething über-square’s tribute to the promise and potential of the hippies, as well as an intensely violent homage to non-violence."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,50,"The whole picture nicely conveys a Southwestern atmosphere. But much too often, at the cost of plain credibility, it stacks its cards, characters and even credo like any rootin', tootin' Western."
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,50,A down market youth pic with Laughlin as the half-breed Vietnam veteran who stands up for America's misunderstood youth and operates a sort of one-man Countryside Commission.
Billy Jack,6.2,98000000,40,"The material played upon all the best aspects of the socially conscious movements of the 1960s, and then perverted them by preaching that violence is indeed the solution to problems as long as it's for the right cause."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,70,Sufficient cheap thrills and enough of the prevailing camp quality.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,70,"Sublimely trashy, this conceptual sequel to 1997's surprise hit, ""Anaconda,"" doesn't expect to be taken any more seriously than its schlock predecessor, and keeps its tongue-in-cheek thrills flowing rapidly."

Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,58,The charming thing about Anacondas is that it neither takes itself too seriously nor is it steeped in postmodern irony.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"To be fair, it's little better or worse than the original. But, to be honest, the original--minus its nascent stars--wasn't very good."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"From its jungle forays to its waterfall tumbles to its deadly spider bites - is entirely, utterly unoriginal."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,Supremely silly but undeniably fun sequel.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"A programmer that once upon a time would have played on the bottom half of double bills, Anacondas has no pretensions and gets its little job done effectively, providing some small-scale laughs and chills for the late summer season."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,At least director Dwight Little (Free Willy 2) gives us enough B-movie speed to keep Orchid from becoming a fountain of aging.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"Still manages to one-up its predecessor, 1997's unintentionally campy ""Anaconda."""
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,50,"Competent formula entertainment, but doesn't make that leap into pure barminess that inspired ""Anaconda."""
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,40,"Director Dwight Little, who has made many mediocre films as well as the gleefully gory Robert Englund version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" gets at least one thing right -- he really does take time to establish the characters."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,40,"More tongue in cheek than its predecessor, and yet less over the top, it won't do any permanent damage. Of course, it won't leave much of a lasting impression, either."

Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,38,It's never a good sign when the creepiest moment in a movie about monstrous 50-foot snakes is the sight of 2-inch leeches sucking on someone's back.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,38,The biggest problem with the corny horror film Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid is that its titular reptiles are about as scary as jellied eels.

Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,33,"There's no enjoyably outlandish hiss to this variation on the formula, and no Ice Cube or Owen Wilson, either.

Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,30,What they don't do often enough is battle anacondas. It's all tease and no payoff.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,30,Clearly a bottom-feeder.
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,30,"The real problem isn't that Anacondas is bad  it's just so bland, so unremarkable, so by-the-numbers, and so instantly forgettable that bad might be a step up."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,25,"This movie didn't have to be good, but that it's so boring in its badness is tough to swallow."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,25,"The refined taste insists on risibly bad, on hysterically bad, on poke-your-seatmate-in-the-ribs bad, and this falls well short of that hallowed mark -- it's just routinely bad."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,25,"The sequel might have the formula down, but it lacks everything that made ""Anaconda'' fun."
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,4.6,32238923,20,"When the CGI snakes finally arrive, they look like they've just returned from a guest spot on ""Charmed;"" if the film had cut any more corners, it would have had to borrow graphics from an old Intellivision game."

The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"There's nothing special, shocking, or precedent-setting about the film, but it functions on a level that 007 fans will appreciate - as eye and ear candy for those who prefer action to exposition and character development."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,Fans will appreciate not only that the film is predictably solid and surprisingly sharp but that parts of it are just plain bad.

The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,"The formula, with its comforting arrangement of familiar elements, is what we're after, and The World Is Not Enough certainly comes through on that front."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,67,"Apted (""Gorillas in the Mist,"" ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") keeps things low-key and low-tech, which makes some of the cliched Bondisms a bit easier to swallow."

The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"The movie's already peaked, even before the opening credits."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"Spoofing James Bond in the '90s may lack an original comic bite, but making James Bond in the '90s is positively toothless."

The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"Brosnan brings an intelligence and wit, together with a lightness, to the role - his softly Celtic vowels pleasingly reminiscent of Sean - along with a plausible virility Roger Moore never quite managed. And Pierce wears some beautifully tailored suits as to the manor born."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"The World Is Not Enough is, without a doubt, a solidly entertaining chapter in the Bond franchise's chequered history. But while Apted fiddles with the format, this is far from an overhaul of the blueprint, and so lacks the whiff of freshness long-time fans may have been sniffing for."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"The latest 007 extravaganza has enough plot developments, double-entendres, emotional underpinnings and, of course, Bond girls, action scenes and explosions to furnish at least a couple of Bondfests, with plenty left over for an episode of Nash Bridges."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"This keeps one reasonably amused, titillated, and brain-dead for a little over two hours."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"In his third and most comfortable effort to model the Bond mantle, Pierce Brosnan bears noticeably more resemblance to a real human being."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,There still is enough tightly staged action and sly humor to earn this latest installment a memorable place in Bond canon.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,007 is undone by villainous scripting and misguided casting and acting in a couple of key secondary roles.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The hero himself has been denatured for a young, late 1990s audience with little appreciation for real suavity or sex play."

The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"If Bond long ago became part of your fantasy life or your pop iconography, then the anticipation of a good Bond movie would probably survive even if The World Is Not Enough were worse than it is."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The World Is Not Enough, like a 19th version of anything, is inanely self-parodic. So much so that one wonders why Austin Powers need have bothered in the first place."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,Makes the strongest case for retirement since late-period Roger Moore.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The new Bond movie is pure nonsense art of the dadaist school; it follows the rules of the ridiculous as it turns narrative convention, thriller formula and special-effects set pieces into a manifesto of the purest gibberish."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,45,James Bond hasn't been this boring since Timothy Dalton carried the license to kill.

The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,70,Lavish in its approach -- it attempts some rather extravagant battle scenes -- yet it still seems modest in its goals: It's more interested in being a Saturday-afternoon entertainment than a blockbuster.
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,67,"The plot is negligible, but that's fine since it's really only a way to get from one set-piece to another."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,63,"The special effects are effective, though not terribly special. While director Minkoff pays homage to past masters of the genre, the past masters were better at this game than he."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,63,"Although veteran choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping ( Kill Bill, The Matrix) handles the wire action, the camera work is merely okay and the sequences are on the familiar side.

The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"Taken as a whole, though, it's an amiable lost-and-found of epic-adventure tropes. As I still illogically treasure ""Willow,"" many a 10-year-old who sees Forbidden Kingdom will remember it fondly in spite of its flaws."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"The wisecracking Chan and the stoic Li play off their on-screen images with good humor, and if they don't have the agility they once did, it's still a joy to watch them make the most of Yuen Woo-ping's impressive choreography."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"A dance of combat and humor saves a contrivance from drowning. Or, rather, Chan and Li elevate it enough to make it into a good time."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,60,"The missing link between '00s wushu, '80s kids' fantasy and '70s chop-socky, this manages to be thoroughly entertaining - and the face-off between Chan and Li is worth the entrance price alone."

The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"It's perhaps best suited for genre vets who can be satisfied with spot-the-reference games and Chan and Li's chemistry, or for undiscriminating kids who'll enjoy the ""Karate Kid"" vibe. But it's less a culmination of Li and Chan's careers than a passable footnote to better things."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"At best, The Forbidden Kingdom counts as an amiable time-waster for kids, but much more should be expected from the momentous union of two kung-fu titans."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"Pairing Jackie Chan and Jet Li would seem like a slam dunk, but this big-budget martial arts drama, which borrows liberally from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is something of a disappointment."
The Forbidden Kingdom,6.6,52075270,50,"There's nothing really wrong with all this in theory, but the overall doofiness of the execution is finally too much to overcome. The filmmakers come off like their protagonist, wide-eyed tourists in an exotic realm. If you've been looking for a martial arts film to take granny and the kids to, this might be the one, but a Jackie Chan-Jet Li collaboration deserves better than that."

Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,63,Everyone knows how the battles will turn out. It's what's between them that raises Masters Of The Universe ever so slightly above the mediocre.
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,63,"If you liked the toy, you'll love the movie."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,50,"There are some decent special effects, but overall it's about what you'd expect from a movie inspired by a line of toys."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,50,"A misfiring, underdone epic that takes its inspiration not from life or literature, but from a toy line and the cartoon series it inspired."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,40,"Little kids at play have come up with craftier plots, better characterization and conceivably more spectacular effects -- provided their mothers let them play with matches."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,30,"The first film to be based on a line of toys, this might not be the last, but it'd take something awful to replace it as the worst."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,20,"I'm not going to lie to you here, this movie is a steaming pile of you-know-what. The acting is horrendous, the story is the most cookie-cutter clone of every movie after Star Wars as you can get, and the effects are downright laughable. Even an easy effect such as a laser blast looks bad here."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,20,"All elements are of epic proportions in this Conan-Star Wars hybrid ripoff, based on the best-selling line of children’s toys. Epitome of Good takes on Epitome of Evil for nothing less than the future of the Universe, and the result is a colossal bore."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,70,"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is an utterly depersonalized thrill machine, yet it’s exactly the film’s go-go relentlessness that is likely to make boys and girls eat it up."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,67,"This big-screen incarnation of the TV kids' adventure show that spawned a marketing empire is no better than it should be, but it's lively enough to fulfill its primary mission -- which is, of course, to sell more toys."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,67,The production values are much higher than those of the TV shows. There's even a plot.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,63,Power Rangers is good junk.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,60,"The special effects are surprisingly good. And the too-numerous fight scenes have a certain flavor, since Ivan's henchmen always explode in ooze when they are destroyed, which brings out the eeewww in the audience."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,60,"Beyond its baby-sitting capabilities, Power Rangers doesn't morph into anything special. It hasn't a single fresh idea."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,60,"It's easy to see why the Rangers are popular. Even before they magically morph, the kids are sky-diving, roller-blading and living without parental authority. And they kick serious butt. But it's all done quite unhumorously."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"With absolutely as little time devoted to character or plot development as possible, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie may not be Battleship Potemkin, but it does deliver the cheesy sci-fi goods for fans of the colorful television show, even if it's not likely to win any new converts."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"On such a limited level this delivers; if you take the kids, leave them to it."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"The comic-book fight sequences, too, are a little more imaginative. But, like the series, the film is also corny as hell, with glaring continuity lapses, cringeworthy performances, silly monsters and laughable set-pieces."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"Noisy and meant for children only. A bored grown-up's only consolation is that the Rangers' popularity has probably peaked, and the next kiddie phenomenon must be on the way."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"Lively, colorful, violent, stupid."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,50,"There's an appeal here, for sure, but if you're not 8 years old you may never figure it out."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,40,This movie is bad on a galactic scale.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie,5.2,38187431,40,Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie is about as close as you can get to absolute nothing and still have a product to project on the screen.
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"We've seen this done before, but seldom so well, or at such a high pitch of energy."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"The film takes off from formula elements-it's yet another variation on ""Die Hard""-but it manipulates those elements so skillfully, with such a canny mixture of delirium and restraint, that I walked out of the picture with the rare sensation that every gaudy thrill had been earned."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"The result is clean, delirious, and, yes, speedy—the best big-vehicle-in-peril movie since Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear."""
Speed,7.2,121248145,90,"The movie has two virtues essential to good pop thrillers. First, it plugs uncomplicatedly into lurking anxieties -- in this case the ones we brush aside when we daily surrender ourselves to mass transit in a world where the loonies are everywhere. Second, it is executed with panache and utter conviction."
Speed,7.2,121248145,90,It's an ingenious premise that first-time director Jan De Bont has turned into a tremendously well-executed motion picture.
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"If you're looking for action movie heaven, try Speed, a crackling blend of suspense and fun that gives you the rush of a runaway roller coaster."
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"Acclaimed cinematographer Jan De Bont's directing debut is a mindless, implausible, and thoroughly gripping adventure movie."
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"This film's dialogue isn't much more literate than a bus schedule, but its plotting is smart and breathless enough to make up for that."
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,There are very few action movies that cut to the chase quite as quickly as Speed and then have the stamina to keep it up for nearly two hours.
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,"First-time helmer Jan De Bont, the ace lenser of most of Paul Verhoeven's films as well as ""Die Hard"" and numerous other large-scale pix, handles the action with great nimbleness and dexterity; film can hardly be faulted for its visual presentation of very complex action."
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,"De Bont knows how to edit a pulse-pounding sequence, he knows how to keep the screen white-hot, and he sure knows how to blow things up real good. What he doesn't know is how to slow down - this premise is perfect for him."
Speed,7.2,121248145,75,"The deft arabesques of cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak juice up the suspense, and if you're not too put off by the sheer ridiculousness of the story you won't be bored."
Speed,7.2,121248145,70,"In a film like this, timing is everything, and everyone from the stunt coordinators to the crew-at-large seems to have gotten it right the first time."
Speed,7.2,121248145,67,"Undeniably, the picture now and again supplies that edge-of-the-seat sensation; yet, by action-adventure standards, Speed is leaden and strangely poky. It never seems to shift into overdrive and let fly."
Speed,7.2,121248145,63,"The plot becomes so overextended, as Reeves and Hopper wage their endless public transportation battle, even the hardest Die-Harders will consider leaping off way before the final stop."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,90,"To appreciate the movie, you have to be okay with vampire violence. I don't mean subtle little nips at the neck and, ooooh, it's directed by Werner Herzog."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,88,"You can sense the difference between a movie that's a technical exercise (""Resident Evil"") and one steamed in the dread cauldrons of the filmmaker's imagination."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,80,"Like the original, Blade II has superior production values and visual and special effects. Snipes and Kristofferson build on the resonance of their original portrayals."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,80,Ghastly yet wonderful at the same time.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,78,Invades theatres with its fangs bared for action. It's bloody hell and we love every minute.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,75,"It's all speed, movement and blood -- lots and lots of blood."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"The drawing card for Blade II is --  the promise of a blood-soaked action/horror thrill ride, and Snipes and Del Toro get the down-and-dirty job done with style."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"Just be advised guys, Blade II is as estrogen-free as movies get, so you might want to leave your date behind for this one, or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"Everything ""Blade"" should have been but wasn't: stylish, fast-paced, and comfortable with its own ridiculousness."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,70,"Because of the movie's wonderful shamelessness, its mordantly funny chills and fights are huge turn-ons.  A B picture in love with the zest of its comic-book origins, it embodies that medium's pulse-pounding spiritedness and silliness."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,67,"Del Toro lays on the operatic head-trip gore, but his heavy-handed embrace of the ''Blade'' mythology allows Wesley Snipes to give more of a performance than he did in the first film."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,63,"Though superior to the original Blade, the superiority is mostly in the myriad ways the ""suck-head"" enemies can be blown up, melted and dismembered."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,63,"The film stays true to its unpretentious origins -- it's like a comic book come to life, with an undeniable visual flair, a lot of kinetic action sequences, minimal character development, and a plot that could charitably be called ""uneven""."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,63,"What makes Blade 2 marginally better than ""Blade,"" especially if you thought the first was a hollow spectacle? It has a plot."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,60,May be too grisly to extend its appeal beyond its fan base.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,"Snipes gives a looser, cooler performance this time around, though emotionally, it's closer to dead than undead. Blade II is for the horror faithful only; others will be grasping their crucifixes."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,Much sillier - and the movie's nearly two-hour running time seems to last nearly as long as a vampire's afterlife.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,Suffers from way too many fight scenes that last way too long and look way too computer-generated.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,50,Even Del Toro can't raise the conceptually dead.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,42,This vampire story is as soulless as they get.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,40,"The sequences are handsomely designed, but frankly, you might as well be watching someone play a video game."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,38,"It was possible to hope that Blade II would turn out to be good. Well, forget it."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,38,"Against the rest of his dramatically flimsy crew, Snipes' sunglasses-at-midnight strut conveys an almost lifelike sheen. Almost. He's more alive than the movie, which is dead on arrival."
Blade II,6.7,82348319,38,Appallingly violent.
Blade II,6.7,82348319,30,Duller than first version.
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,80,"Director Jeannot Szwarc could have done more with the action scenes, but he has a snappy sense of pace and comic timing. Blond, blue-eyed Slater brings an engaging sweetness to Supergirl; and she plays Linda with an awkward, gawky girlishness, subtly different from her Supergirl role."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,70,"Helen Slater is a find: blonde as Supergirl, dark-haired as Linda Lee, she’s an appealing young heroine in either guise. Screenplay is filled with witty lines and enjoyable characters, but Jeannot Szwarc’s direction is rather flat."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,60,Most delightful of the Super-series for its good-natured disregard of narrative considerations.
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,60,"The gift of Christopher Reeve, in his best scenes and when the filmmakers allow it, is to play Superman without laughing, to take him seriously so that we can have some innocent escapist fun. Helen Slater has the same gift, but is given even less chance to exercise it in Supergirl, and the result is an unhappy, unfunny, unexciting movie."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,50,"Supergirl arouses some initial curiosity about the differences between the two cousins; for instance, that Supergirl can't change in phone booths and is much the better flier of the two. However the film, as directed by Jeannot Szwarc and written by David Odell, quickly loses its novelty."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,50,"Slater not only makes for a dull Supergirl, but she's stuck in a clumsy, silly film that tries for the light touch of Richard Lester's Superman II and fails decisively."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,50,"Jeannot Szwarc's direction is flat and uninspired, emphasizing the jokey elements without any sense at all for the material."
Supergirl,4.4,13600000,40,"Queasily suspended between drag theatrics (Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro camping it up on a soundstage replica of a carnival spook house) and Spielbergian wholesomeness (Canadian Helen Slater as a toothy, Aryan Ubermadchen), this is one comic-book feature that doesn't fly."
Things Are Tough All Over,6.0,21134374,80,"Cheech and Chong have a good time with Things Are Tough All Over, and you will, too."
Things Are Tough All Over,6.0,21134374,40,"The jokes tossed into this feeble effort involve Cheech and Chong in drag, herpes, and an S&M porno adventure featuring the comedians' real-life spouses Shelby Fiddis and Rikki Marin."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,75,"Although Americans may be overwhelmed by the dizzy mix of music, dancing, and kung fu, they should have no trouble appreciating the talent of this extraordinary entertainer."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,75,More important is to be in a silly mood yourself. Without that - without a complete suspension of disbelief - Chandni Chowk to China is a drag to sit through.
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,63,"For those with an adventurous and offbeat cinematic appetite, Chandni Chowk to China offers its shares of enjoyments, although there are plenty of ""downs"" to go along with the ""ups."""
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,63,There are inventive and engaging moments in this broadly comic action saga. But Chandni is at once enjoyable and maddening.
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,63,Fun but somewhat exhausting.
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,60,Starts too frantically but settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday-matinee picture.
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,60,"With musical numbers and fight scenes as big as its heart, director Nikhil Advani's action-comedy really does sample it all."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,60,"A decent sampler for Americans who've never seen a full-out Bollywood musical, since it goes heavy on the action scenes and light on the big dance numbers."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,58,"Its combination of maudlin sincerity, cruel slapstick, exotic romanticism and boogie-down dance sequences may befuddle more than it entertains."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,50,"It will appeal to the large Indian audiences in North America and to Bollywood fans in general, who will come out wondering why this movie, of all movies, was chosen as Hollywood's first foray into commercial Indian cinema."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,50,A massive and rather tiring showcase for Bollywood action hero Akshay Kumar.
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,50,Fitfully amusing.
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,50,"Of some interest for promoting rapprochement between India and China, this is still awfully silly."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,50,"At two hours and 34 minutes, CC2C is too much by a half: too much dancing and fighting and too much footage of the Great Wall of China. It does, however, have a vulgar energy and many of the jokes work."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,42,"A more accurate way to describe it would be ""conceptual nightmare""--crass, schizophrenic, culturally insensitive, horribly paced, and shameless in its pandering to the lowest common denominator."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,40,"As with many a Bollywood epic, you can bring the kids, your lunch, your cell phone, your unfiled taxes. There's so much here, and in such heaping, lengthy portions, you could probably weave a sari before the end credits."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,40,"It's a live-action Looney Tunes cartoon that lasts 154 minutes rather than just five, and it's as exhausting as it sounds."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,38,"Entertainingly goofy for about 30 minutes. And then, for the next two hours-plus, it's agony."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,30,"2 1/2 hours of shouting, gesticulating, pratfalls and groin kicks will leave viewers with an MSG headache."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,30,"It's chop-socky vindaloo, pleasing on a platter but awfully difficult to swallow whole."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,25,"It all makes you want to see a Bollywood movie, all right -- a good one."
Chandni Chowk to China,4.0,921738,20,"Alas, Chandni Chowk to China, directed by Nikhil Advani, is asymmetrical in the extreme: shapeless, shameless, and slapdash."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,90,"The summer’s best, coolest, juiciest, smartest action movie."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,90,"It's gleefully bold, visually adventurous, often funny, strikingly concise — the whole heart-pounding tale is over in 90 minutes — and 100% entertaining."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,83,"It comes across, instead, as a directorial flight of fancy, an imaginatively goofy take on an already goofy idea, exaggerated by Besson’s blunt style and an uncommonly fast pace."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,83,"It's basically the perfect summer movie, because it's designed to be."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"This undeniably silly, but raucously entertaining, off-the-wall transhumanist actioner is an absolute riot."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"Besson is at his balls-out bonkers best in this genre-scrambling, mind-expanding exhilarator."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,It’s the blockbuster of the summer.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"Lucy is insane, makes very little sense, doesn't stand up to scrutiny and is an absolute blast."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,78,"The best comic-book movie in a long time, though based on no comic, Lucy is a film that mates classic Besson with Quentin Tarantino in a go at the mystical, world-solving vision found in Stanley Kubrick’s ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Terrence Malick’s ""The Tree of Life."""
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"What Johansson does in Lucy won't win her any prizes, but it establishes her ability to carry a movie that has some ideas, however half-baked, and has nothing to do with her obvious sex appeal."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"When it comes to sheer comic-book fun, few summer movies deliver a more consistent, satisfying, thoroughly enjoyable shot of cinematic jouissance than the delightfully adventurous actress Scarlett Johansson's latest bit of strange, Lucy."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Like many films by Besson — ""The Professional,"" ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Messenger"" and other high-octane shoot-'em-ups — Lucy starts out riveting but becomes less engaging as it goes along."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,Lucy is what a superhero movie might look like if developed by Spike Jonze and/or Michael Gondry.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Scarlett Johansson is ideally cast as a rapidly evolving kick-ass hero in Lucy, a stylish action thriller that is equal parts dazzling and ludicrous."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"It’s all ridiculous and enjoyable, and at the movie’s center is an actress creatively guessing at what omniscience might feel like."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"A full-out action movie - and a sober rumination on the nature of existence. It is both things, effectively and sincerely."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"In a captivating climax, the movie turns attractively freaky, though somewhat marred by cheesy special effects, and there’s a huge debt to the immense leaps of “2001.” An abrupt ending feels frustrating and leaves questions floating in space. Then again, I’m using only 3 to 5 percent of my capacity, so what do I know?"
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"By the time the film exhausts itself—in a brisk 89 minutes — it feels like there's literally nowhere that Lucy and Besson can't go, no boundaries, no laws, no logic. Just go with it."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Vulgar auteurist Luc Besson finally commits wholeheartedly to his decades-long preoccupation with waifish young women discovering their inner Shiva, spinning the concept out to its most delirious possible extremes."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,An outlandishly entertaining mixture of high silliness and high style.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"There are a number of terrific production numbers in Lucy, basically violent action scenes that border on slapstick, and as long as we agree in advance that the “science” in this movie goes beyond pseudo into total B.S., I believe you will leave satisfied."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"Buoyed by Ms. Johansson’s presence, Mr. Besson keeps his entertainment machine purring. He may be a hack, but he’s also a reliable entertainer."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"Giddily recycling everything from “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “The Matrix” to yakuza actioners and National Geographic documentaries, it’s a garish, trippy, wildly uneven and finally quite disarming piece of work, graced by a moment-to-moment unpredictability."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,67,"Lucy doesn't hold together, but with its flashy innovation, Besson's trying to freshen the formula. It's the kind of freewheeling mess of a movie you wish studios would try out more often."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Lucy, you may have twigged, is named after our 3.2-million-year-old hominid ancestor."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Although Besson, the director of “La Femme Nikita” and the producer of “Taken,” indulges in some operatic violence, the film is more spacey than pacey."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Besson’s script may let her (and Freeman) down in the third act, but the 89 minute long Lucy is so brisk it’ll give you whiplash. Even marginal thrillers benefit from a director and star who have a sense of urgency and are as hellbent as this on not overstaying their welcome."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"This ridiculous, highly watchable, at points startlingly psychedelic action thriller is probably Luc Besson’s best film since ‘Léon’ (which isn’t saying a great deal)."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,What begins as a thrilling pastiche of comic-book formula gets bogged down in its own scientific prattle — not that you ever stop adoring Johansson’s magnificent heroine.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"Lucy earns points for its unpredictable treatment of its vaguely superhero-ish premise and an appealing silliness, but it struggles to match wits with the genius at its center."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"The end of the movie goes completely off the rails, but in a way that is charming in its stupidity."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,58,Whether you take to it will depend on whether you consider “high-octane” or “nonsense” the more important word.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,58,"There are moments of real wonder and even beauty amidst the slam and the bang and the big bada boom, and while Lucy is a mixed bag, it's been mixed by a master, and it is delightfully, happily insane."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,52,"Even Besson’s most bold choices – and this is a film that goes weird, and then just keeps getting weirder – don’t seem so revolutionary when packaged in such well-tread trappings and increasingly shoddy writing."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"I know we’re supposed to think that Besson’s daffy cinematic calisthenics are entertaining because at least they are not boring. But I was bored. It didn’t help that Morgan Freeman shows up as a brainy scientist explaining everything to us in his deepest intonations. When was the last time Freeman, a great actor, really acted?"
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"An entertainment choice I wouldn’t recommend, but one you might not regret if you dial your expectations down (or your drug intake up)."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"When everything and anything is possible, nothing feels urgent or truly dramatic. The movie devolves into a melange of digital effects and sequences of glamorous slaughter, as Lucy swaggers around, with that big brain, and slouches toward becoming a full-lipped deity."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,The junk in Lucy doesn't entirely eclipse the moments when weird is fun.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"Remember ""Limitless,"" the 2011 thriller in which Bradley Cooper becomes a whirling killer dervish from a drug that lets him access 100 percent of his brain? Well, Lucy is basically the same movie with Scarlett Johansson in the Cooper role. It's not a good trade-off."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"Lucy is a confounding experience, but at a brisk 85 or so minutes, it manages not to outstay its welcome. Those not enamored of Besson's particular brand of Euro-schlock grindhouse existentialism, however, may find their brains more stimulated elsewhere."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,"A brazenly mindless thriller about the infinite capacities of the human brain.
That said, sometimes we just want to shut down and give in to bombastic summer entertainment. In that regard, as usual, Besson delivers."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,"There's enough mumbo jumbo about space and time and cellular division to allow Lucy to feign depth, but what lingers is Besson's regressive belief that even the most intelligent woman on earth can't figure out how to get her way without a miniskirt and a gun."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,Lucy plays more like a big dumb superhero flick than sci-fi.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,20,"The funny thing about all these sub-""Matrix"" shenanigans is that they’re genuinely meant to stoke thought and reflection. Frankly, though, few movies have left me feeling as shorn of gray matter."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,12,"Besson has always demonstrated the ability to chuckle at the madness of his own material, and he provides some solid laughs from time to time. But these winks do nothing to erase the reality of a plot that becomes unintentionally hilarious."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,88,"I lost count but the word “family” is mentioned upwards of 50 times, many more times than it is in, say, Lilo & Stitch. Yes, it is way too much, like everything else in this aggressively over-the-top film, but at the same time, it just feels nice to be part of the group."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,88,"Diesel and Johnson are at their testosterone-charged best. Theron, who seems to be auditioning to become the next Bond villain, is ruthlessness personified."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,83,"The Fate of the Furious doesn't merely suspend disbelief, it expels it like a delinquent student told to never come back."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,83,"The Fate of the Furious is almost impossible not to like. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do, successfully lighting up the brain’s pleasure centers at each opportunity with a variety of tools in its arsenal."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,80,"The biggest show is, naturally, saved for last.... Nothing in all of the Fast & Furious movies has ever felt bigger or more ridiculous — two things F8 rightfully thrives on. It’s exhilarating. Now how will they top this one?"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,80,"The Fate of the Furious is nothing more than pulp done smart, but scene for scene it’s elegant rather than bombastic, and it packs a heady escapist wallop."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,78,"What sets apart this eighth outing is its giggling bouts of male henpecking, all puffed feathers and nyah-nyah taunts."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"If the fate of the Furious series is to grow somehow both wearier and dumber with age, then the eighth film is proof of a mission firmly accomplished. And there’s no shame, Vin, in hanging it all up after a job well done."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"Polar chaos notwithstanding, “Fate” delivers action with more consistent visual precision than in the last couple of films, as newly enlisted director F. Gary Gray accesses the flair he brought to 2003’s “The Italian Job.”"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The movie zips along quickly, full of popcorn-worthy moments."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The action is not just big — big is easy. It’s creative. It’s choreographed. It’s unexpected and delightful. It’s lots of fun and a stark contrast to the previous film, “Furious 7,” which was huge but flat, just commotion without inspiration."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"Your mileage may vary when it comes to the over-the-top carnage and in-your-face machismo, but it’s impressive just how bonkers Fate is, like a litter of kittens hopped up on grade-A catnip."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The Fate of the Furious doesn't have a thought in its head to match the best of Bond and Bourne. What it is, in every sense of the term, is insanely entertaining."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The movie Tokyo-drifts into tedium in its more chaotic, casually gruesome chase scenes, and the “serious” dialogue is so consistently clunky it feels like it’s been carved from woodblocks with a dull butterknife. Thankfully, it’s frequently also much funnier and lighter on its feet than previous outings, and a lot of that credit goes to Statham and Johnson."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,70,The spectacle gives you enough action from enough famous names to sustain the momentum of its legacy.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,65,"Gray’s prosaic style robs Fate of the Furious of any real sense of self-awareness or humor, which could never be said about Lin or Wan’s installments."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,"“Dumbing down” was coined for productions like this: big, splashy, testosterone-fueled monstrosities whose sole purpose is to give a studio box office bragging rights for a few weeks."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,"“Fate” gives fans of the franchise exactly what they want, provided they can ditch logic as easily as the movie does."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,The Fate of the Furious distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Zoom, crash, repeat with squealing, burning and flaming tires — it’s all predictably absurd and self-mocking, and often a giggle when not a total yawn."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"It’s an odd sensation to watch a Fast & Furious film and find yourself wishing the special effects lived up to the writing, but – well, here we are."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"A very big, exceedingly dumb thrill ride."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"This is a big dumb action movie in its purest, most honourable sense: fast, furious and frequently fun."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Fast 8 is more of the same, more or less, with the emphasis heavily on more."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Overall, there’s a sense that ‘Fast and Furious 8’ knows exactly where it wants to go and won’t bust a gasket getting there: you might ask for a little more character work here, a few more plot surprises there, but on the whole this rattles along just fine."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Fate delivers exactly what fans have come to expect, for better and for worse."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,58,"While The Fate of the Furious is an unquestionably enjoyable outing, it’s beginning to feel a lot like fatigue on a long-enduring franchise."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,58,"More so than in any of the other movies, Dom’s wrecking crew of car nuts comes across like survival-of-the-speediest tacho-fascists, high-fiving their way through a path of destruction and to a collateral death toll that one presumes now numbers in the hundreds."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"There are disposable characters, and not just the villain’s minions. But one of the dumber elements of these movies is how so few of the actual leads, friend or foe, from previous pictures seem to stay dead."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"With The Fate of the Furious, it feels like the movies have gotten as big as they can get, and the gleeful absurdity that drove them is losing ground to the specter of obligation."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"In my favorite scene, Hobbs leads his tween daughter’s soccer team in a haka (Maori war dance) to intimidate their rivals. Can’t wait for “Fast and Furious 11: No Boys Allowed.”"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"There’s certainly a lot to enjoy in The Fate of the Furious, but even the strongest moments are less spectacular this time around."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"The problem this time around is the plot is particularly idiotic, the supposedly snappy quips are lame and come at some weirdly inappropriate moments — and it’s all delivered in an extremely bloated package."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"This is just the sweeps-week Fast And Furious that jumps the shark, ready to right itself come next season – and it better. Dominic Toretto’s team deserves to go out in a blaze of glory, not a slippery skid that can’t be controlled."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"Really, the movie is the third cheeseburger, the fourth beer, the fifth ice-cream sandwich. It’s gluttony, which is kind of enjoyable when you’re in the middle of committing it but leaves you feeling sluggish and remorseful later when you’ve had time to think about it."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"Even as Fate has its fun and chases its highs (a few of which are pretty satisfying), it’s hard to shake the growing sensation that the bloom might be coming off the rose."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"The action has become incoherent, largely past the point of enjoyability."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"It's ridiculous but fun, as it careens from Havana to Berlin and icy, terrorist-ridden Russia played by Iceland, and a spit-ton of medium-grade digital effects. But the second hour gets to be a real drag, and not the racing kind."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,42,"F8 is the worst of these films since “2 Fast 2 Furious,” and it may be even worse than that. It’s the “Die Another Day” of its franchise — an empty, generic shell of its former self that disrespects its own proud heritage at every turn."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,40,"The series seems to have at last entered its frustrating, decadent, spinning-its-wheels phase."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,40,There is only one inventive action sequence here.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,38,"The film finally tips the franchise over from modestly thoughtful stupidity into tedious, loud inanity."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,20,"Is it so much to ask for dialogue that doesn’t make you roll your eyes throughout “F8”? Or, you know, a story that adds up?"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,20,"""Fast and Furious"" movies are supposed to be unchallenging, but Fate of the Furious is full-on brain-dead."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,0,"Who am I to call it soulless, graceless, witless, incoherent — even for the franchise — and, not incidentally, brain-numbingly long at 136 minutes?"
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,100,"This is a movie that strains at the leash of the possible, a movie of great visionary wonders."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,100,"It closes the trilogy like a lightning blast followed by the ominous, resonant drone of thunder. Great action sequences crop up frequently today, but great action movies are always few and far between. Beyond Thunderdome is one, every bit as much as its two predecessors."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,100,"This middle portion of the picture becomes dangerously preachy, but just before we and Max are bored, director Miller returns Max to his roots, a screaming chase sequence through a desertlike Australian landscape."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,88,"This film has showier stunts than its predecessors, and a better sense of humor. It also has Tina Turner, in chain-mail stockings."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,"Gibson impressively fleshes out Max, Tina Turner is striking in her role as Aunty (as well as contributing two topnotch songs, which open and close the picture) and the juves are uniformly good."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,Disjointed but it still rocks.
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,"Miller unveils some marvellously original cinematic snaps (the lost city of the feral children; Master Blaster, the dwarf-powered giant; Thunderdome itself); and if the thrills and special effects lack a little of the punch of Mad Max 2, there's still enough imagination, wit and ingenuity to put recent Spielberg to shame."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,The battle between Max and The Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome may be the best the series has to offer.
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,80,"Its high-bounding excesses of action simultaneously satisfy and satirize the passion for heedless viciousness that so profoundly moves the action film's prime audience, urban adolescent males."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,75,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a bad movie. It has entertaining sections, decent performances and more than a few provocative images. But it also has a major shortcoming: It's too darned sane."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,70,"The Thunderdome sequence is an amazing display of imagination and technical skill, but the film falls apart with the climactic chase scene."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,60,"The directors, George Miller and George Ogilvie, borrow from every source they can find; movie buffs can pass the time spotting the Lynch shot, the Leone shot, the Jodorowski shot, and all kinds of others."
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,6.3,36200000,60,"The punky energy of the earlier films has given way to a self-conscious striving for significance, obscuring Miller's considerable kinetic talents in favor of a lumpy didacticism."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,80,"It’s not simply cashing in on the popularity of the TMNT cartoon, but is actually a thoughtful, emotional, and challenging movie about the loss and reconstruction of family. It’s got lots of hilarious one-liners and ninja action too, making it one of the most well-rounded comic book movies that’s not afraid to hold reverence to the source material while also having some fun with it."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,80,"A well-rounded, unpretentious, very funny, knockabout adventure - subtly blended so that it's fun for all the family."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"High-spirited martial arts and comedy, with heavy doses of Star Wars and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"Barron concentrates on keeping the action moving at a brisk clip, drawing on his music video experience to serve up an entertaining series of odd camera angles, gratuitous camera movements and complicated lighting schemes. The results are lively and funny enough to keep adults enthralled as well as kids."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"The most interesting part of the film for a non-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fan is the production design - the sewers and the city streets above them. Roy Forge Smith is the designer, and seems inspired by a low-rent vision of Batman or maybe Metropolis."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"The script is peppered with clever lines even the transformation (and expansion) of cartoon violence into the live arena is achieved without resorting to realism. To balance the fighting, Splinter waxes philosophically on loyalty, perseverance and anger."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"while many reviewers were put off by Splinter's rheumy-eyed philosophizing and the Turtles' ninja antics, the movie's youthful target audience squealed with delight."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"This film debut of the carapaced comic-book heroes features solid animatronic effects and a straightforward approach to superhero adventurism that should appeal to young Ninja Turtle fans, who should be pleased to see the terrapins brought so faithfully to the screen. However, a long-winded plot, broad characterizations and barely adequate fight scenes will prevent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from generating any breakthrough business."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"Jim Henson's Creature Shop has created splendid animatronic characters (including a four-foot talking rat), though extra distinguishing marks between the turtles would be appreciated. Between the dubbed dialogue and the dark visuals, the cumulative effect is curiously dislocating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"The only thing this film has going for it is its improbable title and title song about four fighting turtles changed into upright, man-size creatures by exposure to radioactive wastes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles never rises above its marketing-hook origins. It's a product, a commodity, a toy tie-in, a trailer for the comics, an advertisement for the cereal. It's a naked sell."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"Parents can vaguely console themselves, however, that amid the kiddie pollution available on Saturday morning TV, the Turtles rank slightly better than the rest. At least they care about each other and fight crime for other than fortress-destroying, fascistically gratifying reasons. And maybe, just maybe, this will make them curious enough, one day, to check up on the real Michelangelo."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles was directed by Steve Barron, who has a number of music videos to his credit, and shows off the skills of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, without which there would have been no film at all."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"Children will undoubtedly enjoy the ninja flick a lot more than their parents will, and it probably won't even give most kids nightmares. But couldn't a steady diet of this sort of thing help to desensitize very young children to real violence? If so, that's awful - not awesome - dudes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"When a kids’ flick has nothing to offer but cute special effects, it’s easy to think the filmmakers are patting themselves on the backs for their technical ingenuity. That’s not comic fantasy — that’s marketing."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,83,"Battleship is a sound vessel floating in Hollywood's oil-slick sea of ""Transformers"" sequels and vampire riffs."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,75,An invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,70,"Here's an audacious, inventive and character-driven blockbuster with some wit sprinkled in for good measure. It's fun, and filled with a surprising degree of intrigue and suspense."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,70,"And when the F-14s came out for a triumphant flyover, I looked around the room to find the moron who was applauding only to realize that it was me."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,63,"The nicest touch is that Battleship has an honest-to-God third act, instead of just settling for nonstop fireballs and explosions, as Bay likes to do. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's say the Greatest Generation still has the right stuff and leave it at that."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,One of the more enjoyably terrible movies of the year.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"It's no ""Das Boot,"" but Battleship is a boatload of popcorny fun."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"The movie drags on way too long, but there are things to like."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"Those looking for big, loud sci-fi action will find plenty to like here as director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) pumps up the volume on clashing military hardware and flag-waving heroics."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,55,"Actually, the picture is perhaps not quite as painful as you might be expecting, though probably not as enjoyable, either."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"The story, by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber, who also penned the clever, quippy, aging-assassin movie ""Red,"" is cleverer and quippier than it has any reason to be, even if it makes not the remotest sense."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Proficient director Peter Berg (""Hancock"") keeps the noise so deafening we can't think about how preposterous it all is."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Battleship has its moments, like the rare occasions when it nods to its origin: There's a nice eureka when we learn that evil alien ships can be outwitted, improbably, by plotting co-ordinates on a grid, à la your granddad's board game."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Battleship is dopey, preposterous and unintentionally hilarious in all the wrong places, but as directed by Peter Berg, it is also energetic, fast-moving and bracing."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"This may sound thrilling, but it's not.  Battleship plays ordinary and pedestrian because it's always been a job for hire, never anyone's passion."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Has a plot as unambitious as a macaroni dinner, familiar and easy to eat and not particularly nutritious."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Like ""Transformers,"" which it rivals in relentlessness, Battleship comes with its own force field, a furious energy that renders criticism irrelevant."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Mostly, Battleship is a noisy, overlong and numbing military-vs.-aliens saga with laughably bad dialogue."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Once the special effects take over, Berg has little room to assert his personality (or tell a story, for that matter), and the movie feels like a chore."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"Overlong and underwritten even by the standards of summer f/x extravaganzas, this Battleship will nonetheless float with many on the strength of its boyish, eager-to-please razzle-dazzle."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,42,"Despite some promising early goofiness involving full-contact soccer and the quest for a chicken burrito, Battleship plays it regrettably straight most of the time, as if the fate of the world really might rest on how well the Navy can hurtle projectiles at alien warships. With eyes closed, the movie uncannily resembles a giant baby playing with pots and pans."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,This is the kind of summer movie that softens your brain tissue without even providing the endocrine burst of pleasure that would make it all worthwhile.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,"Its shameless and nonsensical combination of ingredients finally won me over, after a fashion, when I realized that its gung-ho Navy-recruitment propaganda and retrograde gender politics shouldn't be taken any more seriously than the ZZ Top, AC/DC and Billy Squier songs on the soundtrack."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,"What's the word on the film debut of Rihanna, playing a sass-mouthed petty officer? Dreadful (ella, ella)."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,Miss.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,40,Misguided in the extreme. A scene in which Kitsch and co aim blindly for the broadest of targets – and miss by miles – proves painfully apt.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,38,"It makes ""Top Gun"" look like the work of Orson Welles. At least the Tom Cruise movie remembered to cast actual actors."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,38,"If only there were more genuine rah-rah fun involved, instead of just endless, thudding, seen-it-all-before mayhem."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,38,"Battleship has the IQ of a rutabaga and doesn't require much more intelligence than that to watch. Despite spending copious amounts of time with back story and so-called character development, it's really all about the explosions."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,33,"The script is replete with howlers. My favorite, from Kitsch, after the aliens strike: ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" Indeed."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,33,"There's almost nothing to Battleship beyond its grindingly dull, digitally rendered naval warfare."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,30,"This crass and hugely dumb aliens vs. multiple earthling navies should thrill the hyperactive 10-year-old inside you. Adults, on the other hand – and especially genre-fan adults – will be bored to tears and wishing Bay (or at least Jerry Bruckheimer) had something of their own on the marquee out front."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,30,"Its endless parade of explosions, battles and general mayhem makes Michael Bay seem like Ingmar Bergman in comparison with Battleship director Peter Berg."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Two flesh-and-blood performers stand out among the machinery. One is pop singer Rhianna, looking lovely as usual despite the military gear and quite comfortable with high-powered artillery. The other is Gregory D. Gadson, an Army veteran who lost his legs to a roadside bomb in Baghdad."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"It's loud, it's large, it's stupid, and its best gag involves a chicken burrito."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Way to go, Battleship: Take the crassest of cynical junk, slather it in jingoism and sell it as rah-rah fun for right-wingers."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Battleship is a board game for children, so it stands to reason a film adaptation would also be aimed at kids. But did they have to gear it to really dumb kids?"
Battleship,5.8,65422625,25,"Shamelessly mimics Michael Bay's larger-than-life dialogue, sweeping cinematography, cornball romance, and military fetishism."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,0,The worst humans-fighting-aliens movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of humans-fighting-aliens movies.
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,83,"The Last Boy Scout is a guilty pleasure by any standard, but I’ve seen plenty of guilt-free movies lately that aren’t this much fun."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,75,"The Last Boy Scout is a superb example of what it is: a glossy, skillful, cynical, smart, utterly corrupt and vilely misogynistic action thriller. To give it a negative review would be dishonest, because it is such a skillful and well-crafted movie."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,75,"The Last Boy Scout will win no year-end awards, but at least it delivers the goods-which is more that can be said for most of this year's holiday releases."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,75,"The Last Boy Scout is overwrought, extremely violent, has a relatively unbelievable winding plot, perhaps the foulest mouthed teen ever, tons of low lives everywhere, lots of shots to Willis’ face, and is actually a pretty entertaining effort, an undeniable guilty pleasure."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,70,"This is a movie for the boys who like watching men being real men - cursing, shooting and fighting - and anyone who likes this kind of wham-bam entertainment will certainly get more than their money's worth."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,63,"Mr. Scott directs the film as if he were trying to win a prize for demolishing a building in record time. The opening is good: stylish video images of a night football game played in a torrential rain, climaxed by the only scene in the film that has legitimate shock. After that, the brutality and the pace don't slacken, but interest does."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,63,"Despite the testosterone-charged violence and jaw-dropping sexism, the tone is one of self-conscious excess - a strategy which constantly undercuts the film's celebration of male bonding conventions."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,60,"The story is beholden to the trendy steroid-and-TV world view: pump it up and cut it fast. Still, the dialogue, while fitfully glib, is wry and engaging, like a profane Raymond Chandler on speed. No one acts (in the Stanislavsky sense, anyway) but all perform well."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,60,There’s really nothing special about this entertaining if mindless shoot-’em-up other than an ample supply of amusing juvenile put-downs and elaborate action sequences.
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,60,"The best things about The Last Boy Scout are the editing, Bill Medley's singing, a few moments of Noble Willingham villainy and Willis--whose weary, exasperated style exactly suits this kind of material. But the worst things about Scout are its slickness and self-confidence. A story about lonely heroism in a sick age should be a little hipper to what's really heroic and what's really sick."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,50,"Producer Joel Silver and Willis keep trying to remake Die Hard. This time they call in Top Gun director Scott. The result is mildly interesting, but there are so many weird and gratuitous scenes of insane violence that the effect is drained of impact."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,50,"A Roman circus of guts, glory and gallows humor, this lavish action thriller should sate the genre's increasingly bloodthirsty audience. Like the evening news, it fairly hemorrhages blood and sorrow."
The Last Boy Scout,7.0,59509925,50,"It's a kill movie, the filmic equivalent of a hate crime."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,91,"In the end, the most impressive performance may be Spike Lee's. He uses skill without gimmickry, flash without fuss, to tap the mesmerizing soul of this pulp."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,88,"Lee’s is more of a hard-edged, hammer-and-nail noir than Park’s existential horror, and it’s far less concerned with the internal state of Joe’s mind than the external havoc it creates."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,88,It’s generally a respectful homage that has every bit as much stylishness and visual flair.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,83,"It's been so long since Lee made such a thoroughly amusing work that fans should have no problem excusing its messiness. But make no mistake... Oldboy is all over the place, sometimes playing like a subdued melodrama and elsewhere erupting into flamboyance and gore."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,75,"This American version of Park Chan-Wook's Korean thriller is Lee's most exciting movie since ""Inside Man"" — not a masterpiece by any stretch, but a lively commercial genre picture with a hypnotic, obsessive quality, and an utter indifference to being liked, much less approved of."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,75,Oldboy is an immersion into pure twistedness. The purity of its twistedness is its saving grace.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,70,"Oldboy suggests a filmmaker doing almost as much soul-searching as the main character. There is a brashness in the risks taken, the very imperfections revealing an artist finding new inspiration. For Lee, this weird, brutal film seems to have freed him."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,70,"Surprisingly, the movie doesn’t bear much of the stylistic stamp we’ve come to expect of Lee, who’s in his generic journeyman mode here. But aside from a satisfyingly clever new direction in the denouement, what distinguishes the remake from the original is its cartoonishness."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,67,"For better and worse, Lee’s Oldboy is a more somber affair."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,One of the surprises of Spike Lee’s Oldboy is just how dark the film dares to get.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,Lee’s Oldboy stands on its own. It just stands a bit shorter.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,"In general, Lee directs with less visual verve than Park. Anchored by Brolin, who brings an almost simian physicality to his portrayal, this Oldboy feels simultaneously less showy, less nightmarish and less epic than the original."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Oldboy is lively but numb — checked out, as if Lee were directing it following a period of intense convalescence."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Most normal people will not see this as a ""pleasant"" film -- I hope that's the case, anyway -- but it certain makes you feel something."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Watching Spike Lee’s decent but unmemorable remake of Park Chan-wook’s 2003 revenge picture ""Oldboy,"" I kept trying to figure out why he’d done it."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"If you have seen the earlier version, you can occupy yourself with point-by-point comparisons. If not, you may find yourself swerving between bafflement and mild astonishment, wondering how a movie that works so hard to generate intensity and surprise can feel so routine and bereft of genuine imagination."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Weaknesses from the original remain, including a mustache-twirling villain straight out of a Bond film (Sharlto Copley) and a Freudian master plan that unravels the more you think about it. Give credit to Lee for staying fresh, even if this feels like slumming."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Leave it to Spike Lee to deliver one of the strangest, most off-putting movies for the Thanksgiving holiday."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"While Lee leaves some of Park's more memorable outrages behind, he and screenwriter Mark Protosevich find one or two ways to up the taboo-testing ante, small surprises that retain the tale's edge without pushing into the realm of exploitation."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,58,"Lee is very good at creating a sense of free-floating dread, but he, and his screenwriter Mark Protosevich, don’t have a real flair for pulp."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,58,"Spike Lee's remake of 2003's Oldboy is as brutally perplexing as the South Korean original, and needless for both its repetition and tweaks. Nothing is really lost in translation, or gained."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"While few will debate Lee's ability as a director, this isn't close to being in his wheelhouse. Oldboy cries out for a Brian DePalma, a Quentin Tarantino, or even a David Lynch. The end result bears out the suspicion that Lee isn't right for the material, nor it for him."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"Like Martin Scorsese’s ""The Departed,"" a bloated Americanizing of the Hong Kong cop movie ""Infernal Affairs,"" the Lee Oldboy will startle newbies with its story ingenuities and morbid revelations, while leaving connoisseurs of the source film wondering why Hollywood couldn’t have left great enough alone."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,Graphically gruesome when it means to be a provocative look at vengeance.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"Lee, in a sort of humorless send-up of Tarantino, substitutes kinky for mystery, explicit sex and violence for sex and violence with real shock value. When it comes to this remake, you plainly can’t teach an oldboy like Lee new tricks."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,42,"While Lee edges in enough unique elements to argue a second look at the brutal revenge tale, his lean, blackly comic result is transcendent only in fits and starts, stripping away much of its thematic and emotional heft into one of the most frustratingly accomplished disappointments this year."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"To its credit, Spike Lee’s remake isn’t a slavish imitation. On the other hand, its grit is a grey substitute for the original’s vision and verve. Disappointing."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"This one has its technical virtues, but it’s frankly kind of a muddle, and may have been doomed from the outset. I would divide the potential audience for Oldboy into two groups: Those who will be disappointed and those who will be bewildered."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"From Lee’s point of view, I can understand the enticing challenge of taking on a revered cult film Oldboy. But a pair of ill-conceived casting choices can jolt you out of the film, or worse, elicit the rolling of eyes and barely stifled giggle."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"This is a very confused movie, designed for an audience that doesn’t exist."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,39,"A slumming Spike Lee is still better than most directors at the top of their game, but Oldboy isn’t just Lee’s worst movie, it’s practically his “Wicker Man”."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"The sheer brutality of Oldboy is stunning, especially a deeply disturbing scene in which Brolin tortures Samuel L. Jackson. But this is an unrelievedly grim and hermetic experience throughout, the cinematic equivalent of blunt trauma."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"What's onscreen feels squeezed, truncated and curiously embalmed. It's got no kick to it."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"The feel-bad movie of the holiday season, Spike Lee’s often-repellent Americanized reimagining of Korean director Chan-Wook Park’s twisty 2004 revenge thriller Oldboy is relentlessly gruesome, self-consciously shocking and pretty much pointless."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,The revenge in Oldboy is neither sweet nor sour; it's just drab.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"Spike Lee's version loses the one thing that really worked in the original, the sense of moral complication emerging out of the intertwined action of two men hell-bent on retribution."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,30,"His (Lee) Oldboy is relentlessly unpleasant and difficult to watch, without offering audiences much moral or aesthetic payoff for its hour and 40 minutes of graphic violence and abject degradation. Oldboy is both original and uncompromising, I’ll give it that—it just doesn’t happen to be any good."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,30,"Lee and Protosevich have made a picture that, although several shades edgier than the average Hollywood thriller, feels content to shadow its predecessor’s every move while falling short of its unhinged, balls-out delirium."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,20,"Other than sniggering about what an outré stereotype they’ve served up, it’s hard to see how Lee and Copley can justify this performance, which is quite the worst of the year, and sends the whole final act of their movie straight to oblivion."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,10,"Colorless and soulless in the extreme, it bears no one's fingerprints at all. There's no reason for this Oldboy to exist. It's so DOA, you stumble out of it wanting to eat something alive."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,0,"The longer it drags on, the sillier it gets. A preposterous narrative, illogical red herrings, trick endings, bad acting and—shazam! — Spike Lee turns into M. Night Shyamalan!"
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,70,"Culminates in a show-stopping action sequence set in midtown Manhattan, directed by Ms. Leder with crisp economy and furious energy."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,70,"Slick, gripping and largely believable."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,67,"By no means an embarrassment to the fledgling DreamWorks, The Peacemaker is instead a grand, noisy step in the right direction."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,63,"The chief terrorist is played nicely with war-weary desperation by Marcel Iures, a Romanian actor with the sucked-in cheeks and ennui of a Jeremy Irons."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,63,"It looks great. The technical credits are impeccable, and Clooney and Kidman negotiate assorted dangers skillfully. But it's mostly spare parts from other thrillers."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,60,"Mimi Leder directed Michael Schiffer's script, handling some of the action sequences deftly enough to promote the latent idea that people who don't speak English don't deserve to live."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,60,"What The Peacemaker doesn't do well, though it tries, is bring much in the way of emotion or character development to the table."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,58,The essential spark of surprise is missing. The mechanics of ''breathless'' suspense are blanketed by an atmosphere of creeping caution.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,"Director Mimi Leder fills the mindless-action-movie quota quite stylishly. The trouble is, The Peacemaker thinks it has a mind."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,"Isn't much better or worse than the average James Bond movie, except, of course, that it doesn't have the cars, the gadgets, the girls, or Bond himself."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,"His (George Clooney) rugged good looks spell movie star, but his body language spells Don Knotts, without the wit."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,50,A ticket to terminal boredom.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,40,Ruthlessly efficient and utterly predictable.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,40,Most action movies are so confident of their automatic audience that they're no better than they have to be. The Peacemaker isn't half that good.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,"An uncommonly dour and even grim action thriller that globetrots as diversely as a James Bond film but offers a very limited view politically, emotionally and dramatically."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,"Between them, Clooney and Kidman would still need a third party to work up a personality. In fairness to both, they aren't given much to work with."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,"It's big and loud, but this Peacemaker is still a dud."
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,30,If I were a grief-stricken Sarajevan I'd take offense.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,25,MESSAGE Nuclear blackmail is a horrible crime but can be defeated by vigilant and courageous authorities.
The Peacemaker,5.9,41263140,20,Punishingly dull.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,80,The delight of this awesome thriller is simply that Schwarzenegger--an old hand at this sort of running-around-shooting-henchmen thing--could easily sleepwalk through the movie...but he doesn't.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,"Spottiswoode and Schwarzenegger deliver a clever and colorful conspiratorial thriller with high-energy action scenes, car crashes a go-go, spectacular technology and big explosions, packaged with ferocious glee and spoofing humor. Who could ask for more from Ah-nold?"
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,This movie knows how to entertain.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,A well-crafted entertainment containing enough ideas to qualify it as science fiction and not just as a futurist thriller.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,Well worth the price of admission.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,"A fun ride. It's loud and obvious, but it's also the first high-tech, sci-fi thriller to think through some of the implications of cloning and capitalism."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,A clever but routine science fiction flick.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,"A bit of a clone itself, but it's got a crackerjack helicopter chase, a semblance of a script, and a sotto voce performance by Robert Duvall as a biotech genius who murmurs sweet nothings to his dying cloned wife."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,"Offers high-speed helicopter chases, fireballing explosions, deadly laser guns, futuristic technology gone amok, multiple car crashes, two Arnold Schwarzeneggers for the price of one - almost everything except a plot that makes sense."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,67,"The movie isn't ""Blade Runner,"" but it's got some provocative ideas about the implications of cloning in a market-driven, capitalist society."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,A mostly standard-issue latter-day Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner spiked with a creepily plausible cloning angle.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,Plays like something picked up at a vintage store; you can see all the greasy fingerprints from those who have handled it before.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,"This movie is a clone itself, a far cry from ""Total Recall"" but vastly superior to ""End of Days."""
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,"Like Schwarzenegger himself, it looks tired, and a little bored."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,60,"Edited like the world's most expensive car ad. The screen opens and closes like a nervous accordion, and the action shifts speeds like crazy."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,60,"From its standard-issue action to its halfhearted dialogue and acting, that's one situation even two Schwarzeneggers aren't enough to solve."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Offers director Roger Spottiswoode a chance to have the worst actor in Beverly Hills play scenes with himself.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Achieves a level of hypocrisy astounding less for its brazenness than for its sheer stupidity.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,It's mediocrity at its most unremarkable.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Neither smart nor exciting enough to justify the effort.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Another droning formulaic thriller.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,It’s impossible to envision a sequel with pleasure – this kind of lightning wouldn’t strike twice – but the first one could hardly be improved.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"Compared to Deadpool, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a bastion of sobriety and good taste."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"Smart, sexy and outrageous, Deadpool delivers."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"It’s a voraciously self-aware comedy, one that dines out on the inherent inanity of its own premise as much as it does the movies it’s competing with."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"Deadpool is one of those movies that’s all the more successful for how easily it could have gone so very wrong. It’s suffused with an arch, self-aware wit...yet it takes its romance and revenge storylines just seriously enough to keep us engaged."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,83,"It is almost preposterous how little ""plot"" there is in the film...What it has in spades is attitude, and right up until the moment the film began, I was afraid It was going to be so juvenile and filthy that I would end up annoyed by it. Instead, from the very beginning of the opening credits, it is clear that director Tim Miller and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have crafted something deeply silly that isn't remotely interested in playing by the conventional rules of what we've come to think of as ""the superhero genre."""
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"It takes a strong stomach for extreme violence and over-the-top obscenity, but if you're willing to roll with that, Deadpool is a hoot."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"What sets Deadpool apart is its overall genre-busting tone, which blends a wealth of meta humor, the wisecracking Reynolds' significant skills with a one-liner, and a genuinely funny script that isn't afraid to offend anyone."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,Deadpool is neurotic and needy – and very entertaining. An innocent pleasure.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"Loud, lewd, inventive and outrageous, Deadpool is a delight. All credit to Reynolds and co. for having the steel balls to go this far."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"It takes a little while to get in gear — or perhaps just to adjust to what's going on here — but once it does, Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos, as well as the first Marvel film to irreverently trash the brand."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"As a vehicle for the impudent comic stylings of Ryan Reynolds, this cheerfully demented origin story is many, many cuts above “Green Lantern,” and as a sly demolition job on the superhero movie, it sure as hell beats “Kick-Ass.”"
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,78,"Loaded with sass, sex, and sadistic violence, Deadpool is not your youngster’s comic-book origin story. Deadpool earns every bit of its R rating, a quality that’s sure to appeal to fans weary of the macho, apple-pie-eating, altruistic superheroes who buck for attention in the comic-book stables."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"It's also violent to point of sadism, explicit both visually and in terms of language. A potty-mouthed splatterfest, in fact — but a funny one."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"This movie's junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,First-time feature director Tim Miller has created a work that’s both aggressive and not aggressive enough.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"Deadpool is, on the whole, a big bowl of fun filled with great stunts, gory fight scenes, and sexy poses."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"They even make the requisite cameo by Marvel founding father Stan Lee feel profanely inspired. Not your usual Marvel superhero scene? In this case, that’s a good thing."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"Maximally cheeky. Perversely potty-mouthed. Riotously funny. Insanely violent. Uneven as all get out. And fun, fun, fun."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"Deadpool's flawed insolence is appealing, like a mangy pup crawling into your lap."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,There are more funny lines and opening credit sight gags in this than most comedies have in their full running time.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"It doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story. What it has is the balls to mess with the formula and have some naughty, hard-R fun. It’s a superhero film for the wiseasses shooting spitballs in the back of the school bus."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,72,"This humor could be profoundly ugly, given how it's aimed at reducing other people's grotesque deaths to punchlines. But first-time director Tim Miller keeps the tone light — in his hands, Deadpool is more a snickering, naughty nut than an authentic sociopath."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,"Deadpool is a send-up of Marvel movies but in no way a takedown of them. It’s not subversive — it’s meant to elasticize and enhance the superhero genre, to flatter the audience for being hip enough to get all of those in-jokes."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,"It’s no surprise that the teams hired to bring a property like Deadpool to the screen know how to keep the machine oiled and humming; it’s the ones who somehow manage to temporarily stick a wrench in the works, adding something human — a feeling instead of another quip — who are worth your attention."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,Deadpool might even stand as one of the strongest and most inventive films of the high-early-late superhero baroque — if we could just turn off its built-in commentary track.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,"More often than not, Deadpool’s bratty energy feels liberating, allowing for a sexier, dirtier, more hilarious superhero movie than the typical all-ages Marvel affair, which is so concerned with maximising profits that it risks offending no one."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,67,"The eccentric touches—a Wham! musical cue, a dash of screwball body horror—are just accents on a stealth franchise extension. At a certain point, you have to do more than just recognize and point out the mold. You have to actually shatter it."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,67,"As is often the case with such violence, it eventually becomes numbing. By its midpoint, once the novelty of a superhero movie showing super levels of violence wears off, the thinness and lack of spark in the fight scenes becomes more readily apparent. By the film's end, they are hard to distinguish from any other superhero fare. Similarly, lack of imagination keep the film's prodigious swearing and occasional nudity from feeling like anything original."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,"For grown-ups, however, Deadpool avoids enough pitfalls to both embrace and flambé the superhero genre while also finding time for romance, doling out equal handfuls of bullets, barbs and warm fuzzies."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,The movie's far from dull. But first-time feature director Tim Miller's film serves as critique as well an example of what ails the superhero movie industry.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,"If only Deadpool were as clever, dark and funny as it believes itself to be."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,The whiplash contrasts between snideness and sincerity is deeply rooted in the main character's psychology.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"The ambition is laudable, but Tim Miller’s movie, far from seeming reckless and loose-limbed, comes across as pathologically calculated, measuring out its nastiness to the last drop."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"You're initially jazzed by his effrontery, but Deadpool, with his relentlessly glib, nothing-sacred attitude, is not an individual who wears particularly well."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,It's buckshot humor that is funny when it lands; cringe-worthy when it doesn't.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"For a film that vocally questions convention, it's perhaps a shame that Miller and co. played it so safe with a fairly cookie-cutter origin story, but it's really just there to give Reynolds ammunition to riff on. Whether the studio might be willing to push the character further into the leftfield in the future will depend on whether Deadpool warrants sequels."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"The sheer number of dick jokes will soon numb you to their impact, but this is a fun, if patchy, alternative to the glut of ‘the world is about to end unless we do something’ comic-book films."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"The fourth-wall-smashing is fun in a Ferris Bueller kind of way, but it’s never pulled off with the devious panache of Blazing Saddles, let alone Funny Games or Hellzapoppin’. Since it's this stuff, rather than the ongoing thud-thud-thud of bad language and gore, that feels mould-breaking, it’s a pity Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick’s screenplay doesn’t have the courage to experiment a little more."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,58,It seems less irreverent than self-congratulatory.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,"Deadpool, intended as a spiky antidote to superhero oversaturation, ends up impaling only itself."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,It’s hard to imagine a movie much more aware of itself both as a movie and as a moment in a cultural progression of similar movies than Deadpool.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,"It’s a remarkably straightforward origin flick, lacking in true satire of its genre, carried almost entirely by its lead. Deadpool is a fun character, but he’s still in search of a fun movie to match his larger-than-life personality."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,"It’s a film that desperately wants to upend the tropes of the comic book movie, but perhaps more shocking than anything that comes out of the mouth of its often obnoxious titular hero, is how blandly the picture sticks to the origin story playbook."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,40,"Bloody, shallow and oh-so-smug, Deadpool is so eager to offend that it’d almost be sweet if it wasn’t so, well, relentlessly annoying."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,40,"While Deadpool’s core audience will appreciate the way it flatters their knowledge of genre conventions with winking, cynical humor, too much of this stuff just plays like smug self-satisfaction. The movie is so impressed with itself that the viewer’s satisfaction seems completely irrelevant."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,38,"This one is a “different kind of superhero movie,” meaning even more fiercely attached to the mode of artistic expression known as “puberty.”"
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,25,"This is bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it’s just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema’s future."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,25,"For an 11-year-old sneaking into the theater for his first R-rated movie, Deadpool could prove to be a revelatory trip. For myself, it was an exhausting, grating experience, lacking in wit and cleverness as it crumbles underneath its wall-to-wall torrent of jokes. If this represents a new stage for comic-book adaptations, the future is even more dismal than one could have imagined."
