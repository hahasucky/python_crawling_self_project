John Wick,7.4,43037835,91,"John Wick, is not only a return to badass form for the actor, it's also one of the most excitingly visceral action flicks I've seen in ages."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,90,It's a B movie made with A-student love for the relentless thrill of bodies in brutal motion.
John Wick,7.4,43037835,90,"Harboring few ambitions beyond knock-your-socks-off action sequences, this crafty revenge thriller delivers with so much style — and even some wit — that the lack of substance takes longer than it should to become problematic."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,89,"At the center of it all stands Reeves, a convincing embodiment of both the calm before the storm and its subsequent capacity for ruin."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,88,"A lean, spare, stylish and grimly, methodically ultra-violent extravaganza that provides star Keanu Reeves with a much-needed infusion of cool. And hard-core action fans with combat-centric cinematic expertise on a par with 20ll’s “The Raid.”"
John Wick,7.4,43037835,83,"Their use of Kaleida’s sparse, slinky “Think” — one of the most effective and eccentric sound track choices in a recent action movie — underscores the sense that what the viewer is watching is essentially a very loud and bloody dance piece."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,83,"John Wick won't redefine action movies, but it perfectly exemplifies what I want from an action film when I go. Have fun with the world, shoot the action well, motivate it in a way that doesn't feel cheap."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,82,"The blood-slicked, vividly drawn film universe John Wick illustrates is such a generous slice of pulp that, even if not original, per se, it exudes a confidence rarely seen these days, surefire franchises be damned."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"John Wick has such stylistic assurance that even when it falters – the music’s a bit moronic, and the subtitles for Russian dialogue get a naff, pseudo-pulpy typeface – it mainly tends to remind you how much you’re enjoying everything else."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"Above all else John Wick is a lean, mean revenger to go with its ice-cold protagonist. It's not perfect, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable action movie this year."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"A giddy helping of artful violence delivered with a wink and a cheeky grin. Unsurprisingly, John Wick 2 is already in the works."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"With Wick—the best Reeves role in years, and the best existential actioner since Drive—Reeves fans have found something that should cheer them up, too."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"John Wick is a violent, violent, violent film, but its artful splatter is miles away from the brutality of ""Taken"" or the gleeful gore of ""The Equalizer."" It’s a beautiful coffee-table action movie."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"Reeves is wonderful here, a marvel of physicality and stern determination — he moves with the grace of an old-school swashbuckler."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,80,"Distilling a couple of decades of stunt work and second-unit directing experience into 96 minutes of runtime, Stahelski and Leitch expertly deliver one action highlight after another in a near-nonstop thrill ride."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"John Wick is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of. You know who you are."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"John Wick is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days. The once popular genre, which was headlined by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger during its heyday, has been a dying breed during the past two decades."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"John Wick breathes exhilarating life into this tired premise, thanks to some dazzling action choreography, stylish visuals and–most importantly–a vintage anti-hero performance from Keanu Reeves."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"Reeves’ skills are on glorious display in John Wick, an expertly made revenge drama in which he goes all headshot on lots and lots of bad guys, and it’s awesome."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,"Neither surprising or groundbreaking in any particular way, the movie gives us what we want and leaves it at that."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,75,There are enough pleasures going on in John Wick to elevate it above just another dumb action movie.
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"Quibbles aside, John Wick is the smartest display of the implacable but somehow ethical Reeves character since the ""2008 Street Kings."""
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"There's something refreshing about a movie that knows what it is, and what it wants to be. John Wick is that kind of movie."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"Keanu Reeves is the perfect figurehead for this kind of yarn, as he was in The Matrix: Emotionless, poreless, and polished, his character is more a graven idol of vengeance than a human being seeking it."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"Both ludicrous and ludicrously entertaining, John Wick's stylish look, B-movie vibe and less-is-more, longer-takes-are-stronger-takes approach to action make it a standout."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,70,"If you can stomach the setup, then the rest is pure revenge-movie gold, as Reeves reminds what a compelling action star he can be, while the guy who served as his stunt double in “The Matrix” makes a remarkably satisfying directorial debut, delivering a clean, efficient and incredibly assured thriller."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,67,"Director Chad Stahelski — Reeves' stunt double for Point Break and The Matrix — aims only for a kinetic revenge yarn with wrinkles drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs might appreciate, like martial arts moves at point blank bullet range; what he'd call gun fu."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"The movie’s one big pitfall, really, is that Reeves’s character is so intently focused, he takes care of business a bit too quickly. Some final skirmishing and a tonally false sign-off feel like unconvincing bids to stretch the story to a more legit feature length."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"The film is thematically thin, and it has a tendency to embrace the action genre's more obnoxious elements, but there's a proudly no-nonsense air to its nonsensicality."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"Like so many action movies, John Wick goes way beyond a reasonable carnage threshold. Brawls that are exciting in the beginning become dull as each sequence attempts to outdo the last. But John Wick has a more interesting story and better fights than most."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,63,"Reeves animates the action and the filmmakers surround him with wonderful co-stars; the quietly menacing McShane, the chop shop operator (John Leguizamo), the dapper “cleaner” (David Patrick Kelly of “The Warriors”) and the spitting, hissing Nyqvist."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,60,John Wick feels like action manna for its cleanly designed gun-fu sequences—ones you can actually follow—and brutal takedowns. But the revenge plotting is deeply dopey and we shouldn't have to choose one or the other.
John Wick,7.4,43037835,60,"Plot is not the movie’s strong suit. But stylish set pieces are, including one epic blast-a-thon alongside a pool."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,58,"There are some attempts at a comic-bookish, film noir vibe, including a hotel where all the crooks and killers stay, forbidden by house rules from ""doing business""on the premises. And everywhere Keanu turns, he bumps into a character from HBO."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,50,"John Wick reminds you this actor deserves better. Reeves makes the movie entertaining in a background-noise way, but he can’t give it any gravity, even when the filmmakers pull the cheapest trick in the book to get the audience to root for the hero and hiss at the Eurotrash villains. Someone get this man some good work, quick."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,40,"John Wick makes a few feeble attempts at witty repartee, but, in the end, Leitch and Stahelski's film feels like an unintentional parody of itself."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,38,"Aside from the very occasional stab with a dagger, John prefers to shoot people at point-blank range. It gets old fast."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,38,"John Wick serves up a noxious, clashing blend of hyper-realistic and cartoonish violence. Too bad there's no cinema decontaminating service that can wash our memories clean of such useless gore."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,38,"Sorry, Keanu, but you stole my time and you murdered my brain cells. By the sacred oath of WHOA, there will be blood, and this time it’s personal."
John Wick,7.4,43037835,12,"John Wick is the most blatant attempt to establish a character’s name recognition since the Angelina Jolie actioneer ""Salt."""
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,90,"This is a movie of tremendous visual daring, magnificent special-effects work and surprising moral gravity."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,88,The sheer filmmaking craft on display here shames almost any comparably budgeted superhero picture you can name.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,88,"In form, it's no wham-bam VFX sizzle reel replete with sputtering, ejaculatory climaxes. It's the magnificently sustained equivalent of Ravel's ""Bolero,"" with nuclear warheads in place of timpani rolls."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,88,"The director thinks visually, which sounds redundant until you realize how many monster movies are flat, effects-dependent factory jobs. Edwards knows how to use great heights for great effect."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,83,"The worry regarding 2014's Godzilla was that it would seem like a retread of recent big-budget monster mashes ""Cloverfield"" or ""Pacific Rim,"" or, worse yet, that it would sink to the depths of the 1998 American reboot. Happily, though, this one can stand on its own two enormous three-toed feet."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,83,"This Godzilla doesn’t tap into deeper cultural anxieties the way its 60-year-old ancestor did. Nor does it engender much dramatic investment in its hero... Yet as pure popcorn entertainment, Godzilla delivers plenty of goosebumps."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,83,"This could easily be ground zero for a whole new series of films, but if it remains a stand-alone single movie, Edwards told an entire story, and for the first time in as long as I can remember, it feels like Godzilla actually matters."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,80,"That rare breed of blockbuster that emphasises character over spectacle and slow-burn tension over relentless action sequences, Godzilla rewards patience with strong performances and sparing, spine-tingling set-pieces."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,80,"The human drama isn't always as compelling as it wants to be, but at its best Godzilla is a hugely entertaining blockbuster that starts strongly and finishes with a mighty roar. The king of the monsters has returned, and it appears he's here to stay."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,80,"A summer blockbuster that’s not just thrilling, but that orchestrates its thrills with such rare diligence, you want to yelp with glee."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,Godzilla 2014 is a more somber and frightening reboot than the cartoonish 1998 movie.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"The second half of Godzilla is definitely more fun than the first part of a film I enjoyed overall, if less than last year’s similar dip into giant monster blockbusterdom, “Pacific Rim.”"
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"Here, finally, is a giant monster movie made in the anything-goes CGI era still capable of making your jaw drop."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"While it has its moments of baffling plot development and the human characters aren’t exactly Shakespearean in depth, there’s some pretty impressive CGI monster destruction here, and the talented English director Gareth Edwards clearly respects the thought-provoking sci-fi roots of the original."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"In many ways, Godzilla is a cousin to Edwards' earlier movie, ""Monsters,"" in that it focuses more on the ineffectual humans than the monsters."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,75,"Edwards manages to sustain a grim, cerebral atmosphere all the way through, as if fighting the inevitable demands of the material. The movie contains enough basic money shots to please hardcore Godzilla fans without indulging in them at every opportunity. By contemporary blockbusters standards, it's practically a minimalist enterprise."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,70,"You don’t go see a 2014 Godzilla reboot for the delicate character shadings and plausible story structure. You go to watch a giant radioactive lizard whale on stuff, and on that score, Godzilla does its work."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,70,"Edwards’ film doesn’t care much about metaphorical resonance, and cares even less about its human characters, many of which get forgotten for long stretches of the film. But Godzilla has a way with a disaster setpiece, and it cares a lot about providing awesome monster-on-monster action on a mammoth scale."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,70,"Superbly made but burdened by some dull human characters enacted by an interesting international cast who can't do much with them, this new Godzilla is smart, self-aware, eye-popping and arguably in need of a double shot of cheeky wit."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,67,"It’s just a popcorn movie – but it’s loud, smashing fun, if you accept it as a high-tech piece of silliness."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,67,It’s a creature feature for the Subatomic Age.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,67,He doesn't seem too interested in his actors — they're more plodding than their reptilian costars and you don't care about a single one of them — but Edwards does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,65,"We're here to see the film's leading lizard, who is pretty gorgeously realized by an army of digitizers, even if he seems just a bit-player in his own movie for the first hour or so."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,63,"An uneven spectacle that can’t sustain its solid first-half character moments. But the movie can also flash a surprising, often clever sense of legacy, and is intermittently capable of thrilling us."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,63,"Fortunately, the monsters are actually kind of a kick. And isn’t that why you go to see a movie like this anyway?"
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,63,"Seeing the scaly dude side with Mother Nature against the freaks is almost worth enduring the blather that precedes it. I said ""almost."""
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"Ironically this big, lumbering movie could have used more, not less. More Godzilla without question, and more emotional content for its very good cast too."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"It is at once bloated and efficient, executed with tremendous discipline and intelligence and conceived with not too much of either."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"How many times have we complained that summer blockbusters are all about the action, at the expense of niceties like character development? Well, Edwards has gone in another direction, one that's more intriguing in theory than on the screen."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"Edwards’ film boasts great filmmaking, noble intentions and cracking monster action. Yet it never reconciles its B-movie origins — preposterous premise, clichéd characters — with its solemn, Nolanised tone. This Godzilla stomps but very rarely romps."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"It’s always fun to watch scaly, skyscraper-size behemoths lay waste to civilization, but a bit more human drama wouldn’t have gone amiss."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,Edwards seems to have miscalculated our investment in his cast...simultaneously underestimating how satisfying some good old-fashioned monster-on-MUTO action can be.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,60,"The best thing about this new Godzilla is that it spares no expense or effort to deliver big, burly IMAX-ified action... The worst thing about this new Godzilla is how that’s the best thing about it."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,58,"Sometimes, oftentimes, trailers showcase only the good stuff. The actual movie is a pale substitute. Such is the case here."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,58,"Godzilla asks you to care about its characters, achieves that aspiration, earns your trust, and then not only pivots towards a far less interesting character, but abandons most of its absorbing emotional legwork for a fairly rote and straightforward rock ‘em, sock ‘em monster movie."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,55,"Director Gareth Edwards (“Monsters”) gets the money shots right, but neither he nor screenwriter Max Borenstein (working from a story by David Callaham) makes the human characters interesting enough to get us through two mostly Godzilla-free acts."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,Skip Godzilla the movie. Watch the trailer.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"Godzilla – both the movie and the big guy – is otherwise something of a lumpy, lumbering great beast of a thing, lurching from city to city, continent to continent, smackdown to smackdown and plot point to plot point with singularly graceless indifference to anything other than those take-home jaw-dropper shots."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"When the film finally gets around to monsters on a rampage, you'll get both more and less than you bargained for."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"The problem is that he — unlike most modern sci-fi directors, who throw so much CGI at you that they make miracles cheap — seems peculiarly stingy when it’s time to deliver."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"What's particularly weird about Godzilla is that for long stretches, all it shows is destruction."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,The latest Hollywood version of the Godzilla story is neither fun nor fearsome. It’s an empty spectacle in which the humans are as meaningless as the monster.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,At some juncture — much earlier than director Gareth Edwards intends — Godzilla needs to stop being an extra in his own movie.
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"Godzilla is one of those generic, omnipresent blockbusters that's undone by the very spectacle it strives to dazzle us with: Everything is so gargantuan, so momentous, that nothing has any weight."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,50,"In a tale this timeworn and a film this devoid of humor, with only a few moments of humanity, with tension frittered away by the tedious repetition of the fights, anybody who has ever seen Godzilla in any incarnation can be forgiven for asking the obvious. “What else have you got?”"
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,40,"Despite a few fiery breaths, there’s mostly hot air from a lot of serious actors slumming it."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,40,"While many people might want to go to the cinema to see Godzilla, what they get instead is a load of homosapiens desperately trying to put a human face on the drama."
Godzilla,6.4,200676069,30,"Edwards’ Godzilla dawdles toward its Doomsday climax; the movie could win a prize for Least Stuff Happening in the First Two-Thirds of an Action Film... It’s a concept lacking a magnetic story, a package without a product."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,100,"The Avengers latest stand feels well worth the wait. It’s not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn’t dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you’ve come to demand from an MCU movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,100,"Marvel has solved their third-act problem and villain problem and then some. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. But then, neither are our heroes."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,93,"Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. It’s what happens when moviemakers take their source material seriously, eschewing unnecessary melodrama even as they fully embrace the grandeur, the sheer spectacle, of it all."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,91,"After years of movies where even the most mediocre heroes appeared to be invulnerable and indomitable, it’s an arresting jolt — and exactly the film the franchise needed."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,90,"The film boasts plenty of comic-book action while also making room for a darker tone and emotional resonance rarely matched in previous installments. In a cinematic world stuffed with big-budget movies, Infinity War is a genuine blockbuster."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,90,"Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,89,"Never has the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War—the title is almost too apt—is a narrative juggling act the likes of which I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before. It is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,89,"The Marvel films have been accused of being repetitive in their structure; Infinity War bursts any conventions wide apart. This is a vast, truly epic endeavor, one that both brings the current MCU to a near-climax (wait for the so-far-untitled follow-up, due May 2019, for the ultimate resolution), and sets the future in motion."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"No, it’s not a game-changer like ""Deadpool"" or ""Logan."" It remains firmly anchored within the “traditional” comic book milieu. But, with an unwavering devotion to spectacle and action, the film throws down a gauntlet where this kind of mass team-up is concerned."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"Infinity War might be the biggest and most ambitious Marvel movie yet, but it’s certainly not the best. (I’d put it somewhere in the bottom half of the Top 10.) However, there’s plenty of action, humor and heart — and some genuinely effective dramatic moments in which familiar and beloved characters experience real, seemingly irreversible losses."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,88,"It could have been an unholy mess, but with directors Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm, Infinity War is instead a glorious, multilayered and clever comic-book adventure with loads of emotional stakes and a perfect foe for Earth’s mightiest heroes."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,83,"Ultimately, the latest Marvel event is ‘Civil War’ on steroids and as enormous a spectacle as you’ll ever see on the screen that’ll leave you shook. For a movie plot this thin and basic, ‘Infinity War,’ is remarkably gripping, supersized entertainment that should exhilarate audiences, electrify the box office and continue the Marvel hegemony for years to come."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"With so many ingredients to stir into this overflowing pot, you have to hand it to the two experienced teams of Marvel collaborators who had a feel for how to pull this magnum opus off."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,It’s a sleekly witty action opera that’s at once overstuffed and bedazzling.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,80,"Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"A comic-book flick that’s as thrilling and enthralling as it is pretentious and preposterous. The story is just an excuse for the action sequences, and the Marvel strategy remains intact: When in doubt, blow stuff up."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"It’s exhausting, but it’s also frequently effective. It’s surface-level with its emotional beats, but a number of them still land, largely thanks to the continuously all-in performances of the series’ endlessly patient stars. It’s an event that advertises itself as an event in every way, while somehow still managing to justify the immense hype around it."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"It’s filled with moments that click, but it just feels too big."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,All the past decade’s Marvel movies have been heading toward this showdown. Turns out the payoff was worth the wait.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"There are moments of high drama in Infinity War—between father and daughter, brother and brother, mentor and protégé, lover and lover—that these actors, as deep in this series as we are, deliver on with teary intensity. And there’s a haunting final sequence that is as grave and, I daresay, almost poetic as anything the film series has done."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"Infinity War is big, blustery and brave, taking viewers to places that they may not be used to going."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,What saves Infinity War from being just another bloated supergroup tour – and what will end up being the thing that blows fans’ minds to dust – is the film’s final stretch.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"As a virtuoso juggling act, Infinity War has no real parallel in popular culture; as a movie, it’s an impressive montage of greatest hits until the gut punch of a finale."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,75,"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes ... at least not yet."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"So, for basically 90 percent of this movie, I’m sitting there thinking, Okay, this is awesome. Then things changed slightly. And I need to be clear: not to the point it changes how I feel about the movie. I still enjoyed it immensely. But Infinity War did send me out on an unfulfilled note, which, to be fair, is probably by design"
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Flagrantly, bombastically extravagant, it plays its audience like a hundred million fiddles."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Whatever else it may be — a culmination, an obligation, a staggering feat of crowd control, a truly epic tease — Avengers: Infinity War is a brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,The Russos and the hundreds of craftspeople who worked on this film have dreamed up marvelous battles — especially the one where a motley assortment of heroes take their cracks at the purportedly unstoppable Thanos. But only once here did an intergalactic vista catch my breath the way a splash page in a Silver Surfer comic might.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Infinity War boasts the most breathtaking, audacious moment in superhero movie history, one that rocketed through my brain and tore apart everything I thought I knew about the past 10 years of Marvel moviemaking. For the first time in a while, I can’t wait to see what happens next."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being ""Part 1"" and holding enough development for ""Part 2,"" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,70,"Directors Joe and Anthony Russo move their many playing pieces around with as much grace as possible, and they offer up jolts of pleasure throughout."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,67,"Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,67,"This story may be on its last legs, but as table-setting for an even bigger threat, Infinity War daringly leaves more questions in the air. The way this world ends looks to be not with a bang, but a whimper."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"Picking up where Joss Whedon, director of the first two “Avengers” films, left off, sibling filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo have so many pairings and sparrings to work through that the movie is essentially a mixed martial arts extravaganza with a severely overcrowded undercard."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"Characters overflow on the screen, crowding out emotional investment, and there is a severely misplaced emphasis on the power of special effects — many characters appear to be entirely digitized, and none has much screen impact."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,"This movie shouldn't just engage and amuse and occasionally move us; it should shock and scar us. It should kill Ned Stark and Optimus Prime and Bambi's mommy, then look us in the eye after each fresh wound and say, ""Sorry, love. These things happen."""
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,63,It’s really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes “Infinity War” — an “Ocean’s Eleven” in hyper drive — work.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"Organisationally, the movie has a struggle on its hands not to seem like the contents of a toy chest simply chucked down the stairs, with all the chaos of limbs and accessories that implies."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"Thanos is the most interesting, and most complex, character here."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"It’s hard to give sibling co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (makers of the thornier Captain America films) any credit—or blame, really—for steering a product that’s been so corporately fine-tuned. They toggle dutifully between million-dollar quips and Wrestlemania smackdowns, and when they find room for a vista of galactic stillness, it’s not out of any inspired vision so much as the need for air."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,60,"I appreciate the sheer logistical achievement of Infinity War (and the chutzpah of its ending). I laughed a bunch of times, and some of the scenes are definitely exciting. But I would be lying if I pretended this movie ever grabbed me the way the best MCU movies did."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,58,"Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"The plot consists of bits: a fiery slugfest, a pause for bonding, a quick weep, and a patch of jokey repartee, before the slugging returns. Acts of sacrifice are dotted throughout, and we are urged to applaud the burgeoning fellowship of those who unite against Thanos, but, in truth, it’s every man for himself."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"As for everything that happens this time around, it’s a function — or malfunction — of the sequel’s two-part structure. The problem is penultimateness, too much setup and too little payoff. The solution comes, presumably, around the same time next year."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Over the last few years, the Avengers, together and separately, have spawned a number of good, very good, or reasonably entertaining movies. But with Avengers: Infinity War, the Marvel Comics franchise arrives at the stage of decadence. There’s just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"The film has its momentary diversions, a few good throwaway jokes amid a tremendous amount of PG-13 maiming and destruction."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Ordinary rules of drama don’t apply in the Marvel Universe, so expecting Avengers: Infinity War to build suspense, reach a climax and deliver some sort of conclusion is just…unreasonable."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,"Where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act, including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond, as it were) brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,50,Infinity War is all manic monotony. It's passably numbing in the moment. And despite the hard-luck finish—something an obligatory post-credits sequence goes a long way toward neutering—it's instantly forgettable.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,40,Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,40,"There’s no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It’s all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time."
Avengers: Infinity War,8.5,678815482,38,"Even by Marvel’s own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,88,Aquaman is as concerned with scientific accuracy as “SpongeBob Squarepants.” And that’s one of many reasons why I like it.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,85,It’s a weird and wonderful superhero adventure that strives — and almost succeeds — to be the most epic superhero movie ever made.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,80,"In its best moments, Aquaman is transportive. There are worse ways to spend a Saturday afternoon."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,80,"Aquaman is worth seeing if only for its original visuals and the grand vision from director James Wan. As a whole, it is a bit of a mess and ends up being an exhausting experience that would’ve benefited from some judicious editing."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,Aquaman works because it isn’t laughing at itself—it’s both joyously whimsical and confident in its own seaworthiness.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,"I don’t see Aquaman ever reaching icon status, but I’ll say this: He’s a lot more fun on his own, when he’s not saddled with those overly serious stiffs Superman and Batman."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,"In making the first DC superhero film in a long time to aspire to anything like levity, Wan finds a way to catalyze what might have been yet another dust-dry origin story. The secret? Just add water."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,"A big dumb acid-trip of a super-hero movie, Aquaman is relentless, noisy, entertaining nonsense – particularly in 3D IMAX - as overlong as any of them, but not boring, and as I say, at times trippy."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,75,The glee that director James Wan clearly has playing in the world of Aquaman is infectious. He’s made a movie for both types of 10-year-olds: literal kids and those who are 10 at heart. Aquaman is one hell of a popcorn movie.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"There’s a level of self-awareness in Aquaman’s more grandiose images and plot movements that’s certainly been missing from previous DC movies. The story is so deliberately corny that it’s never really moving, no matter how much it reaches in the direction of emotion."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Wan not only embraces the inherent silliness of a hero whose signature power is talking to fish; he revels in it, finding the childlike awesomeness at its core. You can still see every plot beat coming from miles away, but it feels like destiny rather than repetition, the fulfillment of a promise every movie makes and few deliver on."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Notwithstanding the inevitable formulaic dialogue and a superabundance of boilerplate superhero action sequences, Aquaman turns out to be, almost despite itself, an engaging undersea extravaganza."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Aquaman’s as formulaic, excessively thrashy, and mommy-obsessed as any other entry in the DCEU, but its visual imagination is genuinely exciting and transportive, and dare I say, fun."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,70,"Aquaman is imaginatively ambitious superhero cinema with no rules, which is more positive than negative as Wan's vision is realized like an underwater laser light spectacle that the DCEU so desperately needs right now."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,69,"For the most part, the DCEU just can’t square its admittedly exciting set pieces with solid storytelling. In turn, whenever Aquaman pops a squat to unload exposition, it grinds to an interminable halt. Those action scenes, though. Revolutionary at best, innovative at worst."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,"Aquaman also benefits from a cast that is unafraid to chew a little scenery. Momoa is an established entity at this point in his career; equal parts cartoon character and Eighties action lead, he carries the film through its muddiest moments through sheer charisma."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,"Aquaman is a pure piece of bright, ridiculous spectacle, hammering its Saturday morning cartoon sensibilities down its audience’s throat with a huge, cheesy grin on its face."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,It owns up to its cheese.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,67,"There’s a joy to the film’s ornate beauty, a loving craftsmanship that rescues Aquaman from the branded synergy that so haunts and chokes it elsewhere."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,63,Aquaman refuses to do anything original or unpredictable and turns into a by-the-numbers tale of how the trident-carrying King of Atlantis becomes a protector of both land and sea. It accomplishes this by hoping that special effects saturation will compensate for screenplay weaknesses.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,63,An Aquaman sequel is reportedly in the works. The series already has a strong leading man and a feel for an epic. The filmmakers just need to find the heart of their ocean.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,63,"Even with its flaws and struggles with originality, Aquaman is reminiscent of the early Marvel movies in its storytelling, best when taking wild swings instead of being an earnest superhero jam."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"Jason Momoa's surf-bro superhero is a welcome addition to a ponderously serious genre, but his movie as a whole feels waterlogged."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"At the end of the day (or, anytime of the day, really) I think I admire Aquaman more than I like it. It’s certainly ambitious."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"Overlong, but Momoa’s charisma, plus first-class fishy FX, keep it afloat."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"A superhero movie with the scope of an epic but the spirit of a mischievous boy, Aquaman is a goofy, uneven adventure that proudly sticks to its loopy vision even if it doesn’t quite work."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"Aquaman’s greatest strength is its visual style. Even when it borders on bioluminescent whimsy, it’s so distinctly and ceaselessly its own, instead of mimicking its DC/Warner Bros. counterparts. You almost don’t mind that you’re watching comic book cheesiness or such a convoluted plot because, like Momoa’s hair, it’s just so fun to look at."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"There are some legitimate criticisms you can level against Aquaman. You could never say, however, that this movie doesn’t go for it. It goes for everything — maybe too much, when all is said and done."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,60,"This is an Aquaman film that needs lots more Aquaman and vastly less bombast. It’s visually wild and recklessly inventive, but the cast deserve better than to be cast adrift in a tempest of CGI."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"At least Aquaman has a different palette, and new shapes to work with. It’s still ultimately silly and dreary, and will test the endurance of fans who then must withstand an even longer credit sequence to get a whiff of the next DC story wrinkle."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"Aquaman is a mess of clashing tones and shameless silliness, but a relief after all the franchise’s recent superhero gloom. Any budget-busting epic that finds time to show us an octopus playing bongos gets a pass in our book."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"Aquaman’s first glimpse of Atlantis is meant to convey wonder, but mostly there’s a sense of digitally over-busy déjà vu, as we’re reminded of more inventively designed fantasyscapes in “Thor,” “Avatar” and so on."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"To both the movie’s benefit and detriment, the seas here are choppier than in the predictably (and sometimes boringly) smooth sailing of a Marvel movie. But the bright spots (Momoa, that octopus) can be difficult to really relish amid the oceans of exposition and a typically pulverizing, overelaborate screenplay."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"This visually clumsy and gauche, but spectacular, movie knows what it wants to be when it grows up for better or worse."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"Aquaman gets his own adventure, and it’s kind of a shock that it doesn’t suck, but only if you’re willing to sit through two hours of water-logged world-building before the movie finally takes off."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"One is grateful to have Momoa for company. Unlike some strutters who can't hide how delighted they are to show off their trainer-honed bods, Momoa wears his superb physique casually and his take-it-or-leave-it, devil-may-care attitude makes the narrative's long haul much easier to bear than would otherwise have been the case."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,50,"In a better world, Aquaman would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea can’t salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,42,"Wan, a director who’s proven himself to be a can’t-miss ace regardless of genre (from the horror formulas of The Conjuring and Insidious to the big-budget tentpole mayhem of Furious 7) seems to finally be out of his depth. He’s conjured an intriguing world, but populated that world with dramatic cotton candy and silly characters, including a hero who’s unsure if he wants to make us laugh or feel — and winds up doing neither. Pass the Dramamine."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"It’s just two and a half years of — sorry, two and a half hours — of oceanic screen savers and hair that won’t stop undulating so we know when we’re underwater."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"There is the occasional cool visual and clever world-building detail, like jellyfish couture and eye-popping underwater physics, but Aquaman never fully commits to its lunacy."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"The film isn’t totally unenjoyable, but it isn’t particularly coherent either."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"For all its sporadic wackiness and wonder, on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they’ve given it a heroic shake."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,40,"Wilson is just, frankly, dull. He is not allowed to develop an interesting character and he suffers from the obvious comparison with Loki, Thor’s adopted brother played with relish by Tom Hiddleston as a velvety-voiced villain. But then Momoa’s good-ol’-boy characterisation of Aquaman itself only goes so far. This is a film that never quite comes up for air."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"This bloated, big-screen take on the DC comic is dumb, but not nearly dumb enough."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"Aquaman has that usual DC bloat about it, too much attempted, a movie not trimmed (in the script stage) into its best, most coherent story, sharpest jokes and most important confrontations."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires, pretending to swim."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,38,"Often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, the film seems to dare us to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,37,"On the plus side is the eye-popping production design, although that is also, like the plot, too, too much, dazzling the eye with more fantastical Atlantean technology and — inexplicably — underwater fire than a Las Vegas edition of Cirque du Soleil. Like the frequently shirtless Momoa, it’s pretty at first, then it just hurts."
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,25,It seems director James Wan had one overarching goal in making “Aquaman.” His prime directive? Crush the audience into submission.
Aquaman,7.1,335061807,25,"Aquaman continues to revel in the outdated 1970s superhero ideal that mankind is unquestionably worth saving. Add to that some awkward dialogue, a poorly conceived visual effects palette, and a soul-crushing and bladder-crushing 139-minute run time, and you have another disappointing entry in the DC Comics cinematic universe."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Not only is Fallout the best Mission: Impossible film by a considerable margin, it is also undoubtedly the best action film of the year."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,Cruise and McQuarrie have made the best film in the franchise’s history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie in several years.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"It’s got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it. This is one of the best movies of the year."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Unlike many of his action-cinema contemporaries, McQuarrie excels at creating clear lines of sight for his set pieces, and cutting them together to ensure maximum tension."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie borrows just the right amount of familiar spy tropes in his second “M:I” outing, and his film, while intelligent and witty, never becomes too self-serious or chatty. It’s the best night out at the movies so far this summer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"McQuarrie also builds on the last film’s self-aware level of wit and, most importantly, its set-piece-crafting sophistication. No action sequence is allowed to peter out, or be chopped to ribbons in the edit, or lean on the crutch of CG augmentation."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"A combination of thrilling stunts, insane daring and clever writing make this a stunning piece of action cinema. Just be sure to take your heart meds first, and hold on tight."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"McQuarrie brings grace and grit, and Cruise brings it, period. This quick-witted, fleet-footed franchise shows no sign of flagging."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"He’s only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be — or maybe he’s only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he’s always promised us, and it was totally worth the wait."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma’s sweat-drop precision, John Woo’s craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"Simply put, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the best action movie you will see this year. You’ll probably leave the theater overcome with an urge to go jumping from building to building."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,100,"It’s the kind of pure, straight-no-chaser pop fun that not only keeps taking your breath away over and over again, it restores your occasionally shaky faith in summer blockbusters."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is not a triumph of literal realism, orderly plotting, or restraint, but it’s proof that thoughtful execution, comedic timing, and a true moral center count for much more."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"Moving like the lit fuse that blazes brilliantly across the opening credits of both the original Mission: Impossible television series and its first big-screen adaptation, Fallout turns out to be a breathlessly exciting action spectacular: the blockbuster spy thriller as sustained endorphin rush."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,Mission: Impossible - Fallout merges the franchise’s big-budget spectacle with an utterly ferocious style of action filmmaking that far surpasses what McQuarrie executed in either Rogue Nation or Jack Reacher.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,91,"McQuarrie has proven himself such a keen purveyor of large-scale cinema that not only solidifies Fallout as a benchmark for the franchise, but a bona fide manifesto for breathtaking, high-stakes action–a mission that the genre as a whole would do well to accept."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"To be fair, you can scoff at the antics and still be swept away. The final quarter of Mission: Impossible—Fallout takes place in Kashmir, with a helicopter chase through deep gullies and past snowy peaks. McQuarrie keeps the action crisp and clear, to match the icy air."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"This episode is something special, because the dance is so smashingly gorgeous."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"There’s a whole lot of everything in the Mission: Impossible — Fallout, an entertainment machine par excellence that skitters around the world and has something to do with nuclear bombs, mysterious threats and dangerous beauties. Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"As these films have gone on, they’ve become more and more fascinated with Hunt’s essential ludicrousness. Mission: Impossible – Fallout decrees him elemental—a crucial, indefinable component keeping the very fabric of humanity knitted together. The film is so dizzyingly fun that, at least while you’re watching, it seems like a sound conclusion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"It’s not just “Impossible,” it’s irresistible."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"A cinematic centrifuge of acrobatic stunt work, breakneck chases and immersive action, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a perfectly calibrated piece of filmmaking that plays the viewer like a drum right from the start."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense. He places audiences just over Cruise’s shoulder, or staring into the actor’s face as he grimaces with exertion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. Fallout is a testament to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who gives the proceedings a witty, sophisticated grandeur, and yet the film belongs to Cruise and his seemingly limitless passion for putting himself and his audience through the wringer."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"In ragged times, the sophisticated derring-do of Fallout is a welcome gift, a slick and studio-polished adventure that nonetheless has the undermining wink of transgression. The movie’s nerve and moxie successfully make us forget its corporate overlords, and all those other oligarchs grinding millions of American lives into nothing."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"Even as the narrative becomes more perplexing — as before, realistic masks conceal true identities, characters' actual agendas remain hidden — the fast-moving spectacle unfolds in extraordinary fashion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,90,"After two decades, Fallout might be the finest film in the series. (To me, it’s a toss-up between this and Ghost Protocol.) Either way, Mission: Impossible is clearly the best ongoing action franchise in the world. And nothing else even comes close."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"“Fallout” just might be the best of the franchise, and what a rare thing that is for a long-running series."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Mission: Impossible — Fallout is definitely everything we expected, and more. You might need to go lie down afterward, in a good way."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Mission: Impossible — Fallout, is everything a summer action pic should be — a delirious procession of stunning stunts, epic brawls, state-of-the-art car chases and ticking clock countdowns."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,88,"Some of it’s pleasingly old school in its reliance on formidable stunt work. Enough of it, though, gets a digital effects assist for the amazements to scale the heights of plausibility and then leap, like a gazelle, to the adjacent mountain of sublime ridiculousness."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,85,"McQuarrie’s sense of building a scene on the barest of elements, communicating the most empirical of information, is so breathlessly impeccable, the plot barely seems to matter aside from creating easily understood stakes and giving Ethan Hunt a reason to keep, in the parlance of the film, figuring it out."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,85,"Fallout is the boldest of a series that has set a very high (sometimes literally so) standard for breathtaking set-pieces. By my count, the new film has at least seven of them—a generous gift to summer audiences from daredevil star Cruise, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,83,"Mission: Impossible knows exactly what it needs to be: a fun and chummy thrill ride that’s always self-aware. Fallout follows that agenda, while also revisiting its more severe roots. It’s a sequel in every sense of the word, reintroducing not only familiar faces, but styles, themes, and motifs of past films."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Genre convention means it’s a foregone conclusion that this mission is not, in fact, “impossible”, but director Christopher McQuarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Mission: Impossible—Fallout may be the best Mission: Impossible movie since the first, made in the dawn of the cat-Internet age, 1996, by Brian De Palma. Or perhaps it’s just the one with the mostest: even by the franchise’s extravagant standards, Fallout throws off Hope-diamond levels of grandeur."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Whether it’s the next in a long line or a summation of a fun series, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a movie that all but defines escapism at its finest."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"His sixth Mission: Impossible movie, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, isn’t the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol), but it’s easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it’s nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar!"
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"In addition to the absurd stunts and convoluted plot machinations, what makes the Mission: Impossible movies work in general, and Fallout in particular, is that they let their characters be characters, driven by a number of complex factors, even when they’re chasing an enemy or trying to get out of a scrape."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"The practical effects, meaning the real stuff the computer never touched, make all the difference when you’re asking audiences to see the characters as human instead pawns in a digital game."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"This is a film that wants you to live in the moment, to enjoy what is on screen when it is there in front of you and not worry how it fits into a plot that can be confusing but clears up in time for the inevitably rousing conclusion."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is a worthy addition to the franchise and a fast pace thrill-ride.  McQuarrie manages to keep the story, stunts, and structure fresh."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,80,"At nearly two and a half hours, it’s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies — violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action — but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,78,"A relentlessly entertaining exercise in putting Cruise’s Ethan Hunt through his paces again. And again. And again. But hey, there’s much pleasure in watching him continually fall off things."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,77,Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a fun but very familiar entry in the long-running franchise.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"As summer franchise movies go, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is near the top of the heap."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Given all the on-screen risk-taking, Mission: Impossible - Fallout plays it pretty safe. What you get is essentially an action movies greatest hits package."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"The result is a film that won’t make a dent in cinema history but, with an ebullient gusto, it is impossible to resist."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Although perhaps a little too long and not as tightly plotted as Rogue Nation, Fallout offers everything a viewer could reasonably expect from a Mission: Impossible production. It’s reliable."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Not just one of the best but, at its best, an exercise in pure action-movie propulsion and an essay in how to get from Point A to Point B in the most ingenious and exhausting way imaginable."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Much ink has been spent analyzing this enduring phenomenon called Tom Cruise, and what motivates him, onscreen and off. “I just want to entertain people,” he said recently. That’s one mission he can still nail."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"[Cruise] makes the movie fun to watch with his age-defying eagerness and death-defying stunts that bring a reasonably human scale back to blockbuster action, benumbed of late by the low-stakes digital fakery of special-effects movies."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"While the movie on the whole isn’t quite the caliber of the last two missions (“Ghost Protocol” and “Rogue Nation”), director Christopher McQuarrie’s action-packed “Fallout” set pieces are outstanding, finding great character moments in the middle of the explosiveness"
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"While some are hailing Mission: Impossible — Fallout as something truly special, I wouldn’t go quite that far. It does, however, offer as many thrilling dance numbers—I mean, action sequences—as any of the other installments."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"Even its most irritating parts don’t fatally damage a whole that works amazingly well, despite its own excesses."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,75,"There’s a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,70,"For a massive summer tentpole, Fallout’s pleasures are gratifyingly straightforward, direct without being dumbed-down. It’s a meat-and-potatoes banquet, one that doesn’t need to be interesting to be satisfying."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,70,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is cocked, locked and ready to blow you away with more than just Henry Cavill's forearms."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,60,"Over two-and-a-half hours, you get a lot of deafening bangs for your buck, and the tourist location stunts are impressive - but there isn’t as much humour in the dialogue as before."
Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7.8,220159104,50,"As in Rogue Nation, Fallout‘s action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,100,"It’s a movie that, to put it in terms that the film’s screenwriters might appreciate, is Thor-ly needed."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,91,"It’s an enthusiastic, hilarious reboot of the idea of what a Marvel movie can actually be, resulting in an effervescent, delightfully self-aware ride that was the most fun I’d had in a superhero movie in years."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,90,"This is a Marvel movie that knows when to embrace the ridiculous and when to puncture any pomposity, and it's a delight from start to big finish. And yes, you do need to stay to the very very end of the credits."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,88,Just over two hours of entertaining but profoundly silly superheroism.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,88,One of the many surprising delights in the bright and brassy and wonderfully funny Thor: Ragnarok is the recasting of the God of Thunder as a perpetual underdog.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,87,"The third film in the arguably least-loved franchise of Kevin Feige and company’s box office-melting enterprise, it’s also the liveliest, funniest and “loosest” film of the bunch (and that includes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2)."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,85,"Thor: Ragnarok is by far the most unusual of the Marvel movies – a crazy, colorful, ambitious, hilarious ride through the cosmos – even surpassing the Guardians of the Galaxy movies as the former holder of that title. And it’s by far the funniest."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Thor: Ragnarok is a much goofier film than its 2011 and 2013 predecessors, and also a better one."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Thor: Ragnarok, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is so delightfully funny that it’s almost a shame when the film reverts to its campy, melodramatic roots. Thankfully, that’s not hammered too hard."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Thor: Ragnarok is a blast, pure and simple."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"In its own weird little way, Thor: Ragnarok manages to poke fun at the constant churn of myth and entertainment of which the movie itself is a part. It’s a candy-colored cage of delights, but it is a cage nevertheless — and it doesn’t hide that fact."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Though the movie isn’t perfect, particularly in how it underuses some characters and gifted actors, those complaints are easily overridden by distinct moments where charm, oddity, and spectacle collide to create the kind of soul-soaring magic that Marvel at its best is capable of."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"This one is probably my favorite, being the most unlike the others."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"In a world of portentous blockbusters getting ever darker, it’s a joy to see one throwing on the disco lights."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Ragnarok is both the MCU’s funniest outing yet and its clearest beneficiary of a playful, character-ful director’s voice since Guardians."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"The film’s deadpan good cheer makes room for big-budget spectacle and a modicum of emotional depth, but a self-effacing vibe and pop-culture giddiness work the best here — necessary countermeasures as Marvel fights against the inevitable creative fatigue incurred after a decade of multiplex dominance."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Impressively, Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour while fulfilling his obligations to the franchise with Thor: Ragnarok."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"The greatest trick this studio wants to pull, at this point, is to make more of the same feel either exhilaratingly fresh, or sufficiently retro-inflected to qualify as a nostalgia trip. As both, Thor: Ragnarok counts as some kind of double peak."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"The relatively laidback angle on all the murderous spree-ing gives Chris Hemsworth a chance to find the comic groove beneath the title character's beefcake godliness. He does it expertly, and the self-mocking humor is all the more welcome given Thor's essential blandness."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,80,"Daft as a badger sandwich and twice as funny, this is vintage Waititi, and the boldest, most outrageously fun film Marvel has yet produced."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,78,"Despite the notable camp value of Blanchett channeling Gloria Swanson, Cruella de Vil, and an extraterrestrial succulent plant, the doomy villain thing is rote."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,78,"It’s not hard to imagine a young audience completely losing their minds over the thrills and action of Thor: Ragnarok, and then loving it all over again when they realize how funny it is."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,77,"A goofy, kitschy- but- fun romp and the most purely entertaining of the three Thor movies, marked by its distinctive designs, ‘80s synth score, and assemblage of spirited characters. It’s carried by the excellent chemistry between Thor, Hulk, and Valkyrie, who give humanity to a visual effects-heavy spectacle that finally makes good on Thor’s title of God of Thunder."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Waititi emerges triumphant, but it’s a nail-biter."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,Thor films have traditionally landed with a heavy foot. Thank goodness Waititi taught the big guy how to dance.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"One of the silliest and least substantial of recent comic-book movies — a jokey, unapologetically nonsensical romp that makes “The Avengers” look like “The Godfather.”"
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"So it’s uneven, but the good stuff’s unusually lively and buoyant."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"This time it’s not too big. Thor: Ragnarok has a lot of human appeal and a spirit of silliness that it never loses and yet always carefully manages, so that the silliness remains an ongoing source of delight without ever undercutting the impact of the action."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"They’re called comic books for a reason too many superhero movies neglect. Not Thor: Ragnarok, one keenly aware of how silly all this universe saving stuff is. Guardians of the Galaxy is fun; this movie’s funny. There’s a difference."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"The fun here is in the little moments the actors find, and in the way that Waititi, within the massive machine that is a studio superhero movie, brings out a looseness and playfulness in the performances."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Thor: Ragnarok, with its jabs of reportedly improvised banter, isn’t really an action movie. It’s a round-robin buddy comedy, mismatching Hemsworth’s amiable lug to characters old and new."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren’t devastating. I’d watch the first 90 minutes again anytime."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"It’s one of the most refreshing and satisfying Marvel movies in some time, precisely because its willing to do many things that Marvel hasn’t done before."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,The whole movie is a grab-bag of insanity so off-the-chain hilarious that you stick with it even when the convoluted plot goes haywire.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Even tonal issues can’t upend the magic this movie taps into putting Thor and Hulk together as new best buddies, whether they’re throwing down in an arena or having a bromantic heart-to-heart."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Ragnarok is basically a Joke Delivery System — and on that score, it works. The movie is fun."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,75,"Thor: Ragnarok doesn’t break fresh ground by Marvel standards, but it livens up the proceedings just enough to grease up the wheels of this franchise behemoth as it careens along."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"The movie is fun enough, and Waititi shows enough moxie and goofy wit throughout, that instead of feeling glad that he’d been hired to direct the movie, I felt a little sad that he had to bother at all. Meaning: hopefully, Ragnarok will be a big hit and will write Waititi a blank check to do whatever flight of prickly whimsy he wants to do next. For that, it was probably all worth it."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"This is a very funny, perfectly scored...exciting, albeit overlong exercise in pushing MCU boundaries to their franchise breaking point."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,70,"This movie is so colorful and zippy and packed with outlandish supporting characters, that Hemsworth’s job is relatively easy. He just needs to look great, kick ass, nail the one-liners, and ride off into the sunset (or Avengers: Infinity War, whichever comes first). Thor: Ragnarok is sort of like a giant flatscreen TV hanging on a wall with an enormous hole in the middle of it. The TV is beautiful, but it doesn’t fix the hole. It just covers it up."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,67,"In this landscape, it’s rare to get the kind of unabashed silliness Taika Waititi delivers with Thor: Ragnarok."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,67,"It’s brassy, breezy and gut-bustingly fun; unfortunately, it’s at the expense of the film’s drama and pathos."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,"It appears that Marvel has given up trying to broaden the tent. Although Thor: Ragnarok, the third film to focus on the exploits of the titular Norse God, boasts a lighter tone, when the flippancy is stripped away, it’s the same-ole-same-ole."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,"Thor’s bloodsport detour diverts an inordinate amount of the filmmakers’ attention, and ours, from the whole end-of-days buildup. Hopkins gets short shrift, as does Idris Elba’s returning interdimensional gatekeeper, Heimdall."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,Thor: Ragnarok is the flamboyantly roller-disco entry in an already uncomplicatedly cartoonish side franchise.
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,63,"It’s even dumber than the earlier installments, but it knows it. And the result is some good, clean kid-friendly fun, save for the odd profanity — Odin is known for his curses, after all. Even the killing seems to lack fatal finality."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,60,"An excess of levity can quickly become its own kind of leadenness, and for long stretches between its genuinely amusing gags and set pieces, Thor: Ragnarok, credited to the screenwriting trio of Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, is a bit too taken with its own breezy irreverence to realize when it’s time to rein it in."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,60,"Comic book movies have spent a long time striving to be taken as serious, grown-up entertainment but Thor: Ragnarok is almost an admission that you can’t play this material straight. This is probably the wisest strategy with Thor."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,40,"Directed by the enormously talented New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi, it’s well intentioned but ultimately numbing, an instance of fun overkill whose ultimate goal seems to be to put us into a special-effects coma."
Thor: Ragnarok,7.9,315058289,40,"While it’s not saying much, Thor: Ragnarok is easily the best of the three Thor movies — or maybe I just think so because its screenwriters and I finally seem to agree on one thing: The Thor movies are preposterous."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"Rush ranks among the best movies about auto racing ever made, featuring two great performances from the leads, who capture not only the physical look of the racing legends they’re playing, but the vastly different character traits that made their rivalry, well, made for the movies."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"The movie's finest performance is Daniel Bruhl's unapologetic bluntness as Lauda, and his subtle conveyance of jealousy the driver — whose resemblance to a rat is often noted — must have felt about Hunt's popularity and handsomeness."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,Brilliantly captures the exhilaration that comes from facing death head-on. It's also an ode to joyous rivalry.
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"Not just one of the great racing movies of all time, but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right, elevated by two of the year’s most compelling performances."
Rush,8.1,26947624,100,"Utterly gripping. Aided by two punchy lead turns, an Oscar-worthy script and stunning in-car footage, Howard’s race film delivers top-gear drama. A piston- and heart-pumping triumph."
Rush,8.1,26947624,90,"Howard, whose first job as a director was the 1977 Roger Corman-produced “Grand Theft Auto,” has captured what is surely the greatest racing footage ever shot."
Rush,8.1,26947624,90,"Mr. Howard doesn’t just want you to crawl inside a Formula One racecar, he also wants you to crawl inside its driver’s head."
Rush,8.1,26947624,90,"It's both a perceptive dual character study and, that rarity of rarities, a large-scale action movie for grown-ups, one worth leaving the house for."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"Rush, which marks a return to form (and more so) for Howard after plodding through adultery buddy movie comedies (The Dilemma) and Dan Brown sequeldom (Angels & Demons), is almost primal."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"In a way, Howard has made a philosophical drama about the way men move through the world. It’s just a really, really fast drama."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"A fine and fun film tribute to the milieu, the men, women and machines in a sport that was never deadlier or more glamorous than its Disco Decade incarnation."
Rush,8.1,26947624,88,"It's Morgan's core script, full of humor, heartache and verbal fireworks, that lifts Rush above the ""Fast & Furious"" herd."
Rush,8.1,26947624,86,Rush is one of those rare sports movies that’s compelling as both a drama and a spectacle.
Rush,8.1,26947624,85,"A swift-moving, character-rich biopic whose kinetic Grand Prix sequences are constantly being overshadowed by genuinely riveting scenes of ... people talking."
Rush,8.1,26947624,83,"Rush is a pretty thrilling piece of pop entertainment. It's excitingly assembled and moves like a bullet, highly engaging and nerve-wracking when it needs to be and light on its feet elsewhere."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush is just that -- a rush, and a film that is sure to get audiences' engines going."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,This is tremendously exciting cinema – shot by the boundary-pushing Anthony Dod Mantle – as well as old-school escapist drama with ample eye candy for viewers of all persuasions.
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,Rush satisfies our lust for both grand character combat and deadly gearhead spectacle.
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush is fast, slippery, stormy and dangerous."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"What Rush has to offer is a great human drama, two dangerously talented men pushing each other to risky victory and a superb script, delivered with some mastery by Hemsworth and Brühl."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"It rarely deviates from formula, but Rush wins big, delivering the most exciting F1 footage created for film. Like Hunt, it is sexy, funny, full of thrills. Like Lauda, it is intelligent, a bit blunt, but ultimately touching."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl excel as, respectively, British wild man and hedonist James Hunt and Austrian by-the-books tactician Niki Lauda."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush has sex, glamour, a fair degree of wit and a breathless, pedal-to-the-metal spirit. But its greatest achievement may be to underline that there are real men, all vulnerable flesh and blood, inside those infernal machines."
Rush,8.1,26947624,80,"Rush, though it will win no trophies, is fine filmmaking, a smart, visually engorged, frequently thrilling tale of boyish competition — inspired by a true story. At heart it’s “Amadeus” on wheels, only this time Salieri is the Austrian."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"The result is a solid film, but one that remains more interesting than intense."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Howard directs Rush with speed and jangly, jarring verve, bringing the races themselves to white-knuckled life and allowing the men’s stories to play out with only slightly predictable reversals, upsets and, inevitably, those hard lessons learned."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"The ego trips and sexuality and driving are all filmed with equal intensity, to the point where the emotions and flesh and crunched metal seem to blend together. The movie's only major problem is that the tension sometimes overwhelms."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Formula One fans who remember 1976 will no doubt delight in the film but, for those who (like me) were more interested in other things during the year of America's bicentennial, it's not only a good lesson in sports history but an entertaining two hours to spend in a theater."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Rush is the kind of Hollywood studio production that has sadly become all too rare — a smart, exciting, R-rated entertainment for grown-ups that quickens your pulse and puts on a great show without ever insulting your intelligence."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Rush hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death."
Rush,8.1,26947624,75,"Though one enjoys and appreciates Rush for what it is, it does not thrill the blood the way we have the right to expect a film like this to do."
Rush,8.1,26947624,70,Howard and Morgan make the journey intense enough to keep audiences guessing up to the finish line.
Rush,8.1,26947624,70,"Rush, a film about two real-life titans of Formula One racing in the Seventies, splits its narrative between these oil-and-water personalities, which feels about right: It's only half of a good movie."
Rush,8.1,26947624,67,"Rush isn’t bad, exactly, but it’s like a standard-issue male action programmer that somehow crept in from an earlier era."
Rush,8.1,26947624,67,"Rush, in other words, is a foursquare sportsmanship movie, offering little in the way of surprises but plenty of earnest, satisfying thrills."
Rush,8.1,26947624,67,"The problem with car-racing movies, though, is that they are car-racing movies. Has any director found a way to spare audiences the eventual tedium of watching automobiles go around and around a track and instead capture the thrill of the sport?"
Rush,8.1,26947624,63,"It's big, brash and dramatically it goes in circles. The first two may be enough for most people, especially if they're into Formula One racing, to overlook the third."
Rush,8.1,26947624,63,"Howard, whose previous tales of men in professional peril include the topnotch “Apollo 13” as well as “Backdraft” and “Cinderella Man,” works with cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to create a style in the racing scenes that makes the most of every angle. By the time the final lap of Rush starts, we’re up for the ride."
Rush,8.1,26947624,60,"I might have tolerated the film much more with the sound off. With the volume on, this movie feels like a mucho-macho Saturday morning cartoon—specifically Bugs Bunny toying with his eternal pursuer, Elmer Fudd."
Rush,8.1,26947624,50,"For all its immersion in the roar, grease and danger of Formula One, the fact-based Rush — about the sport's great rivalry of the 1970s — is also more predictable than a pit stop, something well-suited to Mr. Howard. He's made perfectly palatable pictures, but never a truly great one, partly because he has such a weakness for the commercial and a consequent gift for the obvious."
Rush,8.1,26947624,50,"The movie leans on symbolic imagery that’s alternately tired and ridiculous: Hunt’s impatiently flicked cigarette lighter (yes, he’s a candle waiting to be lit) or a black-widow spider crawling up the stands of one particularly dangerous course. These are classic frenemies; their tale deserves more gas in the tank."
Rush,8.1,26947624,40,"Ron Howard's by-the-seat-of-your-pants aesthetic makes the slower, darker sequences feel hurried and bland, especially when stacked up next to the racing sequences."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,100,"Far from lazy, it is a fairly brilliant sendup of comic-book action movies, as well as also being an excellent example of one."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,92,"The film ends on a remarkably touching emotional note. Had it held to the strength of its convictions—and it is immensely obvious why it did not—it might have been the best ending of any superhero movie to date. (No, the bar’s not terribly high.) But it’s nonetheless awfully good, and we can still look forward to, mid-credits, the world’s best-ever Green Lantern joke."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,90,A superhero movie so tightly made and brilliantly entertaining that even Deadpool himself would have trouble finding fault with it.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,88,"Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements, terrific ensemble work — and for dessert, perhaps the best end-credits “cookie” scene ever."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,88,Deadpool 2 throws everything it has at you until you throw your arms up in happy surrender.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,83,"Is Deadpool 2 obnoxious? Is it needlessly self-aware? Is it drunk on its own fairly tame naughtiness? Is it so stuffed full of unrelated pop culture references that it sort of feels like a meme shirt come to life? The answer to all those questions is a resounding yes, but it’s also, weirdly, refreshing."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,83,"Deadpool 2, while extremely thin on plot, is gleefully impish, entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny. Almost everything that felt forced, crass and hamfisted in the original film now feels organic and effortless; a constant breezy stream of gags, quips and expertly choreographed action. Deadpool 2 is filthier, funnier and ferociously manic."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,81,"The result isn't as novel as the original, or as effortlessly kinetic, but it is nevertheless a joke-packed action film that continues to deliver on the character's potential, while opening up the door to an even bigger series of sarcastic superhero adventures."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Infinity War will likely be first choice for the summer season crowd, but Deadpool 2 wins hands down in terms of personal stakes and visual flair."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"This is the rare comedy sequel that doesn’t just equal the original: it betters it, with bells and ball-sacks on."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Right now, he's the perfect ""Avengers"" antidote."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. (And yes, you must stay for the post-credit scenes.) Sometimes it maybe doesn’t take itself seriously enough (after about the 50th crack you do kind of want to tell Reynolds to hold off for a minute). But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"Funnier, filthier, and damn entertaining, Deadpool 2 leaves no stone un-deconstructed: the naughty man-child of the X-Men universe who manages to beat them at their own game."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,80,"There's action aplenty throughout the film, but Deadpool 2 doesn't bog down in it as many overcooked comic-book sequels do. With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,78,"Despite the character’s trademark flippancy, there’s a real unexpected warmth to Deadpool 2. Not only does the sequel explore this flawed character, it firmly establishes him as a loveable and effective hero."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"The film’s greatest asset is Reynolds, who in Deadpool finally found the role of his dreams. Reynolds totally sells the character’s blend of reckless self-absorption and reluctant heroics."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Here, Leitch uses brevity to do for witty action what it famously does for wit alone."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"The bottom line is that viewers who enjoyed Deadpool will almost certainly enjoy Deadpool 2, although perhaps not quite as much."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"After shooting lots of people and cutting lots of throats, Deadpool tries blowing himself up, something he probably should have done first. And with that, the movie shifts. Deadpool 2 becomes less violent and a lot funnier. It becomes a much better movie than the original “Deadpool,” not an action bloodbath with laughs, but a knowing spoof of the superhero genre."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"If you’ve got comics-movie fatigue, with frequent fourth-wall breaks to point out lazy writing, blatant foreshadowing or heavy reliance on CGI for fight scenes, Deadpool 2 is here for you. That doesn’t mean those things aren’t there (they are) — but the eagerness of Deadpool to call out its own shortcomings earns this trash-talking franchise a lot of goodwill."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 is chock-full of all the cartoonish ultraviolence, meta commentary and pop-culture references you’d expect. Where it surprises — and why it works so well — is how it balances an actually touching undercurrent alongside superhero subversiveness."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Reynolds is once again at his arch and nihilist best here, while acting and jumping in so much facial prosthetics that it makes him look like he’s inside melted cheese — or, as the first movie put it, an avocado that had relations with an older avocado."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"It’s in Deadpool’s DNA to channel the wild id of a 12-year-old boy — a very clever one who happens to love boobs, Enya, and blowing stuff up. Which is dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 is just like “Deadpool” only more so. It’s actually a fair bit better — funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Like so many franchise-starting first films, “Deadpool” had to push through some necessary evils to get to the good stuff, fortunately, all that subversive goodness is on wild display in Deadpool 2, which delivers on the promise of the first film (and more)."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,Does Deadpool 2 pick up its predecessor’s baton and run off to new and exciting places? Not really. Is it as tasty as leftovers on the second day? Absolutely. Temper your expectations accordingly.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,75,"Deadpool 2 gets by as simply on a par with “Deadpool,” an ultra-violent joked-up Energizer Bunny of a comic book movie with a fun supporting cast, dead-pan deaths and deadpan Deadpool jokes about those deaths."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,71,"Deadpool 2 is at its best when it cheerfully doesn’t give a shit. The more it cared, the less I did."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,70,"Deadpool 2 is an overstuffed cinematic burrito of raunchy insults, dismembering violence and a ""no f#*ks given"" attitude that's ready to burst at any second, but somehow holds together bite after enjoyable bite."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,70,"In almost every respect, this sequel is an improvement on its 2016 predecessor: Sharper, grosser, more narratively coherent and funnier overall, with a few welcome new additions. It’s a film willing to throw everything — jokes, references, heads, blood, guts and even a little bit of vomit — against the wall, rarely concerned about how much of it sticks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,It all boils down to one important fact: Reynolds gets these comics.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,"It still works. Maybe not as well, since the element of shock and awe can’t be put back into its bottle, but anyone who enjoyed Wilson’s transformation into a bullet-hole-riddled leotard that can’t shut up should have as much fun."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,67,"Though bringing in a bona fide action-cheese aesthete like David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, John Wick) to direct counts as a minor coup, Deadpool 2’s attempts to fight superhero fatigue with self-awareness and meta shock value can become exhausting. Indulgent and uneven, but in spots gruesomely funny, the new film badly lacks the basic momentum of the original’s formulaic plot."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,"Deadpool 2 is very good at what it does, which is flattering the audience into feeling like it’s in on the joke. If you’re a doubter, though, you may wonder if the joke’s on us."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,"Since Deadpool 2 shows no sign of wanting to rewrite a whole genre with its audacity, we might as well concede that it does the job it apparently wants to do with professionalism and flair, and that the faster we end this piece, the faster you can go on social media and complain about it."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,63,The original “Deadpool” caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel sparks only intermittently.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"The fight sequences aren’t as good as director David Leitch’s previous work like Atomic Blonde and the John Wick movies, but it’s better than the standard superhero fare, with enough clever touches to keep things interesting."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"There is something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"Perhaps it’s the effort of introducing so many new characters that has sucked out the spontaneity from Deadpool: still, it’s nothing that can’t be sorted for the likely next installments."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,The movie’s other major weakness is its continued foregrounding of the white guys at the expense of the consciously inclusive cast around them.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,60,"With its uncompromising commitment to gross-out injuries, nerdy pop culture in-jokes and inappropriate touching, Deadpool 2 was clearly made to cater to existing fans with every innuendo-filled moment (they should stay through the credits for some important story points that are very nearly thrown away)."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,58,"Deadpool 2 likes to situate itself as the subversive alternative to so many bloated X-Men films, with all their grave self-importance and bombastic action, but even more of this go-around resembles those movies than its predecessor, and if it reads to you as more than a bit hypocritical, just know you’re hardly alone."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"In Deadpool 2, the manic antics fly fast, but the franchise loses its edge as wise-cracking antihero Deadpool goes dadcore, attempting to infuse standard-issue four-quadrant studio blockbuster beats into what was once a revolutionary R-rated premise."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,Deadpool 2 muddies the distinction between parodying comic-book-movie conventions and perfunctorily adhering to them.
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,50,"Never before have the demands of my inner man-child been so stirred, though, than while experiencing Deadpool 2, a movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"Not too far beneath the movie’s superficial abrasiveness is a desperate desire to be loved, a puppyish determination that is both hard to resist and, eventually, difficult to endure."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"There’s no other way to put this: Deadpool 2 is a regular, shmegular superhero movie, distinguished only by an obnoxiously unearned dose of “see what I did there?!” It’s a drag."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"It’s a long movie and when its star isn’t on screen and cracking wise, the boundary-pushing shocks and endless self-references wear thin. Still, if you’re the Deadpool fanatic who recently had Reynolds’s name tattooed on his arse, you definitely won’t be grumbling."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,40,"We’ve reached superhero saturation point, and Deadpool 2 is less a satire of that condition than a symptom of it. It has zero suspense — it’s too hip, too meta, for suspense."
Deadpool 2,7.8,324591735,30,"It’s overstuffed, and essentially empty."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,80,"Watching Apocalypse, you don’t feel as if every character is being set up for his or her own spinoff. They complement one another. They need one another. The overflowing ensemble nature of the enterprise is the whole point."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,80,"This film nimbly mixes narrative exuberance and emotional depth, flamboyant displays of power with quietly terrifying exchanges. It zips along, combining the highs and lows of a real comic book – all the feeling, color, and wonder, even some of the dopiness – with gloriously cinematic storytelling."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,80,"Once again, it's Evan Peters' Quicksilver who steals the movie whenever we see his powers in action, maybe because they've found a unique way to showcase them. There's even a fun but unnecessary tangent involving another popular ""X-Men"" character."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,75,"This isn’t A-level X-Men, but it’s a visual feast, it doesn’t take itself too seriously, it’s brimming with stellar performances, it has some legitimately moving teamwork segments — and it contains perhaps my favorite scene of any movie this year."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,75,X-Men: Apocalypse is a competently made superhero action film but it’s not a game-changer and its brand of action seems a little too familiar.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,75,"Neither resting on formula nor audience goodwill, the “X-Men” series is going deeper and getting better as it goes along."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,70,"The X-Men adventures keep getting bigger, but Singer works extremely hard to ensure that, even when they’re not always better, they continue to thrill sufficiently."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,67,"Much of what makes X-Men: Apocalypse legitimately interesting also makes it frustrating and lopsided, since Singer and screenwriter-producer Simon Kinberg remain committed to the structure of an overlong comic-book blockbuster, complete with a climax in which the world has to be saved using as many different colors of energy beam as possible."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,67,"I enjoyed the energy of the film, and the cast is pretty solid throughout, but there’s a big problem that is inherent to the idea that we have to make these films bigger and bigger to outdo things that have come before."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,67,"Apocalypse, for all its faults, has the audacity to make the MCU look small, and the conviction to make the DCU — if there even is such a thing — look foolish for confusing self-seriousness with gravity. If only these characters were allowed to be as complex as the ideas they fight for, Apocalypse could have represented a new beginning for superhero cinema."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,63,"Director Bryan Singer, who started the whole thing in high style with 2000's ""X-Men,"" returns for a fourth time. Singer shows a lot of energy, but he and screenwriter Simon Kinberg (Fantastic Four, yuck) let the movie get way overcrowded."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,63,"At times, “Apocalypse” can be great fun, even if it doesn’t know when to hand its car keys to a friend and ask to be taken home."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,63,"The action, aside from the cloudy 3D, looks impressive (particularly the destruction of the Sydney Opera House), and X-Men: Apocalypse moves along tidily, but you watch thinking that all this used to be a lot more fun."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,63,"When we have to spend time with Beast and Angel and Nightcrawler and Cyclops and Psylocke and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence, still strong), the movie too often becomes a parade of cameos. Apocalypse has no personality, merely the malevolence of a megalomaniac."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,63,"This ninth installment in the Marvel mutant superhero franchise is rife with urgent and (dare we say?) apocalyptic comings and goings, with characters and confrontations that seem at once familiar and befuddling."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,63,The issue with X-Men: Apocalypse is that Bryan Singer suggests so many possible directions to go in and still chooses the least interesting one.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,60,"For deeply steeped Marvel Comics aficionados it will probably be fairly satisfying, and there’s no reason on earth why anyone else should even bother."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,60,"Disorganized but engaging, full of visual pyrotechnics and earnest emotion, it is diverting, if not necessarily convincing."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,60,"The biggest X-Men movie yet doesn’t scrimp on carnage, but lacks the heft of Singer’s previous instalments."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,60,"The idea of an apocalypse means every dial has to be turned up to 11 and this film certainly provides bangs for your buck, although there is less space for the surreal strangeness of the X-Men to breathe, less dialogue interest, and they do not have the looser, wittier joy of the Avengers. But the more playful episodes with Cyclops and Quicksilver are welcome and everything hangs together."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,58,"Some of the franchise stalwarts, such as Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique, are given too little to do. Most are given too much."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,58,"X-Men: Apocalypse is sprawling to a fault, in both geography and characters to be given something to do."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,58,"There’s a same ol’, same ol’ wash to X-Men: Apocalypse that wasn’t quite as apparent in the previous two entries."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"It’s a goofy, confusing mess of a sequel, a cautionary tale of what happens when a filmmaker lives too long inside his own franchise to realize that no one takes it nearly as seriously as he does."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"Mostly, though, it’s the same old story: Bad mutants versus good mutants, with the fate of us humans — mostly off-screen, disturbingly expendable — hanging in the balance."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"For every lively moment, there’s a reminder that the franchise is tiring."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,McAvoy and Fassbender appealingly reprise their frenemy chemistry. But Lawrence has little to do but look perplexed.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"Point is, the property is running on bald tires, and, for all its ear-splitting racket and lavish effects, “Apocalypse” is the barest of retreads."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"It feels flat, disjointed, with too many moving parts."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"Apocalypse never rises from the sum of its parts, becoming another bloated summer spectacle that rides the rail between fan service and coherent story. You can probably guess which side it eventually crashes on."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"Director Bryan Singer made more hay with Marvel’s mighty mutant menagerie in the early 2000s, but the new film comes undone with too many characters and not enough nuance or freshness."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"The epic effects, titanic struggles and ever-evolving line-up of characters of ""Apocalypse,"" coming hot on the heels of “Civil War” and “Batman v. Superman” and “Deadpool,” underline the exhausted ingredients of the formula these movies all use. The filmmakers strain to find something new to do with them, and watching them try too hard is wearying."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"13 years later, the X-Men are bigger, and the effects used to bring their powers to life are even more convincing. But what’s missing at this point is that sense of awe and wonder from those early days. For all the fighting and blasting and bamfing, we’ve seen it all before — sometimes literally."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"This one’s no gem. It’s simply large, and long (two-and-a-half hours, the usual length lately with these products). I remain unpersuaded and slightly galled by the attempts to interpolate the history, locale and tragic meaning of Auschwitz into what used to be known as popcorn movies."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,50,"Apocalypse feels like a confused, kitchen-sink mess with a half dozen too many characters, a villain who amounts to a big blue nothing, and a narrative that’s so choppy and poorly cut together that it feels like you’re watching a flipbook instead of a movie."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,46,"Not all superhero action films need the MCU's banter or Deadpool's smarm. But you can't play a symphony with a single note. With Apocalypse, Singer never gets around to varying his single, gloomy, dreary tune."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,42,"While not a disaster, it would be fair to say it is somewhere between “disappointingly serviceable” and “embarrassingly pointless.”"
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,42,"Apocalypse feels like a cog in Fox’s perpetual-motion blockbuster machine, paying lip service to the story’s allegorical potential as it grinds our interest to dust."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"The problem is that Apocalypse's highlights feel like moments of serenity amidst two-and-a-half-hours of lumbering, inconsequential chaos."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"Better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but not by an awful lot, and vastly less entertaining than Marvel’s current Captain America smash, it’s also curiously more sadistic, and seemingly less bothered about large-scale human fallout, than this once-spirited series used to be. Apocalypse isn’t quite the end of the world for X-Men fans, but it might be the end of the line."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"Although the X-Men ensembles are usually large, there are simply too many characters for the action-heavy “Apocalypse” to properly juggle."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"Messier and heavier than Days Of Future Past, this is not so much the next step in the X-Men’s evolution as a failed callback to past glories."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"X-Men: Apocalypse provides a hint at what might one day take down the ubiquitous superhero genre: utter dullness. For all its bangs, the movie is ultimately a whimper."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"There are no memorable action scenes—the closest we get is a virtual rerun of the time-freeze sequence from the previous movie. And the script is just nonsense, comprised entirely of sarcastic asides, portentous gobbledygook (""The dawn of a new age will rise!"" cries Isaac) and insider references that only the faithful will appreciate. Unless that’s you, it’s best to steer clear."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,40,"Despite the undeniable presence of a huge amount of action, X-Men: Apocalypse is decidedly a case of more is less, especially when compared with the surprising action and more interesting personal interactions (including the temporary subtraction of some characters) in other big Marvel franchises."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,30,"The previous episode, “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” was as fresh and enjoyable as this one is semicoherent and dispiriting."
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,30,The movie’s top-flight cast is left in ridiculous positions.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7.0,155442489,25,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a confused, bloated mess of a film."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,91,"The Matrix slams you back in your chair, pops open your eyes and leaves your jaw hanging slack in amazement."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,90,"The Wachowskis do it so playfully well, keeping The Matrix's potentially confusing plot intelligible, intelligent, and suspenseful, that it doesn't matter."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,90,"Bill Pope's swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson's inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong. And even if this isn't ""Blade Runner,"" it is very cool shit."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,90,The Wachowski Brothers have created some of the most unrivaled and imaginative sci-fi in years.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,90,This wildly imaginative thriller is a futuristic head trip you most definitely want to take.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,90,"A wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination, The Matrix combines traditional science-fiction premises with spanking new visual technology in a way that almost defies description."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,90,"I'll just say to anyone lamenting the state of American cinema since the 1970s, if you're curious where the next generation of auteurs is coming from, look in the art houses and look in The Matrix."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,88,"Kinetic, atmospheric, visually stunning, and mind-bending."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,88,"With its mix of Lewis Carroll and William Gibson; Japanese anime and Chinese chopsocky; mythological allusions, and machine-made illusion, offers a couple of hours of escapist fun."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,80,"There's a kind of liberating, almost transforming energy in this film; it lights you up and sends you out all giddy with silliness."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,80,"One of the more lyrical sci-fi action thrillers ever made, in which space and time become love slaves to the directors' witty visual fancies."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,80,"This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,80,This full-tilt visual and aural bombardment is simply a lot of fun. It never lets up. Nor does it ever want to.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,80,"One big, fat, honking comic book of a sci-fi-martial-arts adventure flick."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,78,"Doesn't just raise the bar on sci-fi and action films, it rips that sucker off and sends it spiraling into the sun."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,"The plot switches gears every time it threatens to run out of energy, which keeps the show as lively as it is preposterous."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,"Where most effects-laden extravanganzas aspire to be nothing more than a live-action comic book, The Matrix sees things with the venturesome clarity of a graphic novel."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,"The writing remains more intelligent than most thrillers, and the action is executed with such panache that even if you don't buy the reality of The Matrix, it's a helluva place to visit."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,A dazzlingly original visual adventure.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,"It's like animation come to three-dimensional life, and f/x addicts as well as sci-fi fans will not want to miss a split-second."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,"A visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,75,"For those who have been waiting for movies to catch up with the graphic possibilities of comic books, wait no longer: The Matrix is among us."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,70,It may bore you to death or blow your mind -- and it's long and convoluted enough to do both -- but it holds nothing back.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,70,An eye-popping but incoherent extravaganza of morphing and superhuman martial arts.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,70,"Given a budget that encourages their kinesthetic skills, the filmmakers tend to go on a bit, but it's mostly a kind of quick, glancing hipness that's being indulged here."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,70,The martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point.
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,70,"With an arsenal of cool f/x at their disposal, the Wachowskis have come up with a dizzyingly enjoyable junk movie that has just enough on its mind to keep the pleasure from being a guilty one."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,70,"Even if a lot of adults have problems following this picture 100%, look for computer-savvy teen-agers to guarantee this sometimes original but too often derivative time-killer a shelf life."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,63,"The cumulative effect is perversely deflationary: long before it's over, the film has flushed the paranoia from its system."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,60,"The real soullessness here is built into the production, a polished adaptation of Hong Kong-style filmmaking that, with its cast of depressive characters, allows for little Hong Kong-style joy."
The Matrix,8.7,171479930,60,"There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome."

Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,75,"Terminator Genisys fires on all action cylinders when director Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World) follows the model James Cameron set in the first two films, still the glory of the series."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,75,"The best one-liners, like the best fight scenes, are reserved for Schwarzenegger.  It's too soon to tell whether Terminator Genisys will have a catch phrase like ""I'll be back"" or ""Hasta la vista, baby"" but there are several candidates. Much of the film's comedy results from The Terminator's failed attempts to emulate human behavior."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,75,"What’s remarkable is that this fifth Terminator is worthwhile precisely because of its franchise cash-in excessiveness. It’s at once an eminently satisfying actioner, jackknifing tractor-trailers and vertiginous helicopter chases and all, as it is a passably thought-provoking comment on memory – headily engaging with the very nostalgia it intends to evoke."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,67,"This new Terminator, the first since the dreadfully dreary and Arnold-less ""Salvation,"" is engineered to feel at once eerily familiar and raise-the-stakes fresh."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,63,"Genisys goes back to what made the franchise work in the first place: not the machine inside the man, but vice versa."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,60,"Fresh cast, fresh ideas and full-on action gives Taylor’s reboot momentum, even if an overloaded script threatens to topple it at times. Doesn’t touch Cameron’s two movies, of course."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,60,"Genisys is more entertaining than the last two installments, although it's not nearly as good as the first two."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,60,"Terminator Genisys is a reasonably entertaining and niftily executed sci-fi action-thriller, and yet its ingenuity and craftsmanship are all in service of justifying its existence, resulting in a sequel that can be appreciated for its cleverness but otherwise regarded with a certain amount of ambivalence."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,58,"Terminator: Genisys isn't so much a sequel or a reboot but a piece of fan fiction come to ludicrous, big-budget life. Even for an unnecessary entry in a series of movies about indestructible time-traveling robots and genocidal computer networks, it's pretty silly."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"The ultra-tangled plotline of Terminator Genisys makes the rhythm of the action beats especially weird; we see the entire world nuked into rubble by the machine overlords really early in the movie, which makes it hard to get excited about a few buildings falling down later on."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"Schwarzenegger has turned into your elderly uncle, dancing like a goofball at your wedding after a couple glasses of champagne. He knows he’s being silly, and he knows that you know, and that alone is supposed to be good for a laugh. But it’s not. It’s just sad. He has essentially become McBain."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"This mash-up movie is like a greatest-hits collection for obsessive collectors. On its own terms, Terminator Genisys makes virtually no sense."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"For all its weaknesses, Terminator Genisys is a ""Terminator"" movie that feels like a ""Terminator"" movie, more than did ""Terminator 3,"" not to mention the ghastly ""Terminator Salvation."""
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"The best thing in the movie is Schwarzenegger, who delivers the Guardian’s lines with perfect timing and creates an empathetic character, because as we know, nearly all the best movie robots somehow become just a little bit human as time goes on."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"""I'll be back,"" the man said, and he kept the promise, but I'm not sure we wanted him back like this."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"[JK Simmons] provides a little comic relief, and sums up my feelings on this whole outing: “Goddamn time-travelin’ robots!”"
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"The fifth installment of the Terminator series cannot overcome the weight of its convoluted time travel leaps, its strained attempts at injecting twists everywhere, a clunky opening, and a painfully clumsy finish."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,50,"Someone describes the T-800 as ""nothing but a relic from a deleted timeline."" Too harsh to lay on Schwarzenegger yet, but certainly it applies to the Terminator franchise."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,42,"Schwarzenegger, weathered and ironic, strides through the film with old-fashioned authority. Except for Clarke, who walks an ambiguous line between heroism and sinister monomania, only Big Arnie leaves the slightest impression after the credits roll."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,42,"The story isn’t just confusing, it’s a betrayal to anyone who’s invested brain cells in the Terminatorverse over the past 31 years."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Terminator Genisys' ambition overrides sense and depth in the pursuit of a new direction, and then unwittingly proves how little life there is left in this franchise."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Director Alan Taylor handles the big action adeptly as he did in Thor The Dark World, but the script is an ever-decreasing cycle of tool-ups, chase sequences and daft monologues."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Genisys is all bullets and bombs, action without pause, as though if the ride stops the whole thing will collapse under its own weight."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"In practice, the interplay between events old and new is equal parts tedious and indecipherable, with the characters talking about parallel timelines like studio executives thrashing out a franchise in a boardroom."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"Fans hoping to watch Schwarzenegger growl his catchphrases with a slight edge of shtick are underestimating the patience involved in sitting through a two-hour slog. As for those who want a little apocalyptic tension or (dare to dream) romance, this new model is not for you. It’s the Skynet cut."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"The setpieces, in addition to mostly rehashing better scenes from earlier films, feel thrown together to serve the effects, and the effects look far less astonishing than anything in Cameron’s first two films."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"The stunts and CGI and attendant action scenes are all simply fine; there’s nothing here with the stark simple power of “The Terminator” or the strong-but-strange brilliant inventions of “Terminator 2.” Instead, it’s all less-than-spectacular “spectacle” and plot convolutions twisting around themselves at the whim of the summer’s least interesting killer artificial intelligence."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,40,"For all its initial playfulness, the script never rises to the level of surreal, cortex-tickling pleasure it seems to be aiming for, and for all its self-awareness it’s weirdly devoid of humor."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,38,Terminator Genisys feels like being trapped in a conversation with a child breathlessly recounting the highlights of the preceding movies.
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,38,"Terminator used to be a sci-fi franchise defined by its cool time-travel concept and even better special effects. Unfortunately, it's ""Hasta la vista, baby,"" to those good old days."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,38,Everything's at stake yet nothing comes to much in Terminator Genisys.
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,"It doesn’t jell, though, and the movie’s philosophical message is especially grating."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,Terminator: Genisys is a catastrophic misfire on nearly all counts. It’s only saving grace? 2015 Oscar winner J.K. Simmons (Whiplash) as a Mulder-gone-to-pot-esque cop who believes in these “goddamn time-traveling robots.”
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,Terminator Genisys could be Exhibit A in why the current line of thinking in Hollywood regarding sequels/reboots/remakes often leads to terrible decisions and worse films.
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,"It’s amusing to see identical Arnolds clash like titans, but nobody here seems to have fully grasped that they had another heavyweight in Mr. Clarke."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,30,"Action scenes are accumulated as if mandated by a stop-watch and almost invariably seem like warmed-over versions of stuff we've seen before, in Terminator entries and elsewhere."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,25,"When you’ve already put two sequels to this atrocity into the pre-production pipeline… Maybe you should stop. Or maybe the rest of us, the movie-going, sci-fi loving, “Terminator” adoring public have to be the ones to say it. “This ends here.”"
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,25,"There is nothing about Terminator: Genisys that suggests that this film was a compelling, urgent, essential dream for anyone involved. This is all about squeezing cash out of people who are fond of the original films, calculated and without any of the soul of Cameron's films."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,20,"One achievement of James Cameron’s “Terminator” is that it overcame its low-rent, B-movie trappings. The great sin of “Genisys” is that it costs millions and yet isn’t worth a dime."
Terminator Genisys,6.4,89760956,10,What could anyone have said of the finished film except that it was finished? Terminator Genisys plays like the worst of all outcomes.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,Baby Driver zooms onto the screen with an exhilarating combination of smarts and style.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"This is the song of the summer in movie form, a playful ode to car chases, Motown, diners, that moment when you find the exact tune that matches your mood, driving stick, crime capers, ’80s movies and love."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"It all works. All of it. The music, the performances, the twists and turns in the plot, the sheer energy and life force of the movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,[An] outrageously enjoyable petrolhead heist caper.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"Style is the substance of Edgar Wright's inventive heist flick, a fresh, masterful synching of music and getaway mayhem, as if La La Land's traffic jam was moving, armed and dangerous."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"As he proves yet again in his thrillingly syncopated heist movie Baby Driver, the 43-year-old U.K.-born Edgar Wright is just about the perfect 21st-century genre director. He has a fanboy’s scintillating palette — flesh-eating zombies, righteous vigilante cops, stoic bank robbers in sunglasses — without a fanboy’s lack of peripheral vision."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"An awe-inspiring piece of filmmaking from Edgar Wright that plays out as a musical through the lens of an action thriller. Sweet, funny and utterly original — you won’t see a film like it this year."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"The mechanisms at work in Baby Driver, while calibrated with hair’s-breadth precision, are nothing new. Here’s what is: the sheer glee with which the film prods around in its own clockwork to show you what spins what."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,100,"No Hollywood suit and no diehard fan could have had the foresight to picture something like this, namely because nobody but Wright had any idea what this was supposed to be. This is something that’s been brewing inside his head for over two decades, and that unquestionable dedication, confidence, and passion fuels each and every scene of Baby Driver."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"With Wright in the driver’s seat, your standard getaway driver story is transformed into a giddy, adrenaline-filled joyride that’ll leave you gripping the edge of your seat and tapping your feet."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"Like Baby, Wright just wants to feel the music. He makes us feel it, too, one spectacular pleasure high after another."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,91,"The director’s most ambitious work to date is a wildly successful romantic heist comedy, propelled from scene to scene with a lively soundtrack that elevates its slick chase scenes into a realm of musicality that develops its own satisfying beat."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,Sensationally entertaining.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Baby Driver is an almost perfect pastiche, a thoroughly enjoyable object. But sue me, I kind of miss the losers of the Cornetto Trilogy."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Wright has orchestrated every swerve and near smashup—and one glorious foot chase—with precision, a rarity in action filmmaking these days."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"It’s a seemingly straightforward “one last job” crime tale mashed up with a jukebox musical romance, part high-octane action flick and part music video, propelled by perfectly calibrated performances and a wicked sense of humor."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,This is movie craftsmanship and showmanship of a very high order.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Amid all the high-speed action, this “Baby” is also spiked with humor. In large part that's thanks to Spacey and Foxx, as well as Jon Hamm, who makes the bank robber Buddy, one of his better movie roles. Having such strong actors also brings a gravitas to the story."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,90,"Baby Driver, Wright’s first-ever solo screenplay, is a thrilling and original cinematic joyride that pays homage to heist masterpieces while creating a legacy of its own."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,89,"It’s that feeling of seeing something unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. It’s the experience of witnessing the fresh, the new. And if you love movies, there’s nothing like it."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Sometimes I just want a movie that kicks ass. And Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver delivers.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Baby Driver is the best time I’ve had at the movies in months, and, if the world is too much with you (as it is for many of us these days), you may feel the same. It’s a dazzling diversion, a series of cinematic highs that achieve the giddiness of not great art but great entertainment (and thus art through the back door)."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Now this is what I call a summer movie. Baby Driver has it all: thrills, laughs, sex, nonstop action, a killer soundtrack, a star-making performance from Ansel Elgort and a director – Edgar Wright – who can knock the wind out of you."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"It’s uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack’s beat."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Wright is savvy enough to realize that suspense and tension require characters that are more than human figures in a CGI playground. He does just enough with the men and women populating Baby Driver for us to get a sense of who they are.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,"Baby Driver feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It’s as much fun as you’re going to have in a movie theater this year."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,88,Baby Driver literalizes Edgar Wright’s fascination with people’s emotional overreliance on pop culture as a cover for arrested development.
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,85,"Even though the story isn't as impactful as its stylized packaging, Wright creates a delightful new film that is sure to satisfy his legions of fans."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,83,"Wright doesn’t simply apply technical precision and innovation to genre-smart storytelling — he also makes what must be exhausting work look like so much fun. And as a crime caper, heist movie, mob tale, puppy-love romance, jukebox-musical-of-sorts, Baby Driver is almost nothing but."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,83,"The concept of the car chase suffered in limbo for too long with inexperienced directors too often cutting corners instead of respecting why films like “The French Connection,” “Bullitt” and “Ronin” are still held in high regard today. Like all great students, Wright tips his hat to the teachers and refuses to phone in the camerawork on his stunts."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,82,"Best of all are the car chases, which Wright choreographs with the same blend of wit and technical finesse he brought to the pool-cue, “Don’t Stop Me Now” zombie rumble in Shaun of the Dead."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"The script is well-paced and packed with twists and turns that offers little in the way of respites to the beautiful mayhem. The characters, too, are wonderfully realised through the performances from the entire cast, each making a big impression no matter how long they're on screen."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"The result is a supercharged piece of fun unlike any motorized choreography since John Landis destroyed a fleet of cop cars in ""The Blues Brothers."""
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"A subtly innovative blend of cars, guns, music and old-school cool, it's also one of those increasingly rare creatures in Hollywood: an undeniably original movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"There’s much to enjoy in Baby Driver, including the satisfactions of genuine cinematic craft and technique, qualities that moviegoers can no longer take for granted."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"There’s a hint of artificiality to it. Maybe it’s an allegory, but the meaning hidden therein seems simply to be: go faster. Nothing wrong with that. It’s not as if Wright was shooting for something deeper and missed."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"Crime, romance, fast cars, hot tunes... slicker than your chrome hubcaps, Baby Driver is the summer’s coolest movie."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"Baby Driver is exhilarating, fantastically entertaining, and mildly frustrating, all at the same time."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,80,"A crime-flick love story as Pop-conscious as Wright's earlier work but unironic about its romantic core, it will delight the director's fans but requires no film-geek certification."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"At its headiest, it’s like Singin’ in the Rain with a souped-up engine, but even if Baby is the Gene Kelly of the getaway car, watching Baby Driver always feels like watching someone else do the driving rather than being behind the wheel yourself."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Having hooked us with style, Wright knows he has to deliver on the story, and he does. His plotting is tight and fluid, wild and ultimately satisfying. It’s the ultimate cliche to compare a movie to a thrill ride, but sometimes the cliche applies."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"When all cylinders are pumping, Baby Driver is an enchanting experiment that puts the pedal to the metal. And even a few off notes can’t stop the beat of Wright’s fast and furious symphony."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"It's a thrill to watch it unfold, but the slick filmmaking combined with familiar tropes precludes most spontaneity."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Baby Driver is fast and furious and fun as hell, but its cinema of cool may melt down in the coming years, another artifact of reckless, headstrong youth."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"The movie is a little too postured.... Even Baby’s busy backstory threatens to make him a collection of quirky details. But all of that artifice is probably part of the point, best appreciated by generation Ear Bud and its preference for curated experiences."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Baby Driver doesn’t invite over-thinking. But as visceral, swaggering summer popcorn picture fun, it’s hard to beat. Impossible, as a matter of fact. Forget your comic books and sci-fi sequels. THIS is the movie of the summer."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,75,"Rarely do we see a filmmaker start so strong only to end with a whimper. All in all, though, Baby Driver is still worth seeking out, if only for that first hour. Inside those opening 60 minutes is the best action-comedy of the last ten years — full stop — featuring a breathtaking amalgamation of rip-roaring combat, a star-making performance by Ansel Elgort, and a string of clever bits."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"The good news is that, although Baby Driver is not much of a movie, it is an excellent music video — a club sandwich for the senses, lavishly layered with more than thirty songs."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Baby Driver’s superb set pieces and unpredictable song selections keep the story humming along, which is crucial since Wright’s plotting isn’t quite as deft."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Baby Driver proves why we should never doubt Edgar Wright's vision, because few filmmakers can back their ambition with such quality thrills."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,70,"Like all Edgar Wright movies, Baby Driver is a blast, featuring wall-to-wall music and a surfeit of inspired ideas. But it’s also something of a mess, blaring pop tunes of every sort as it lurches between rip-roaring car chases, colorful pre-caper banter, and a twee young-love subplot."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,69,"This movie is all about sensation, about grooving on the very specific but unquestionably catchy hook Wright has laid down for you."
Baby Driver,7.6,107825862,63,"As charming as Baby Driver strives to be, the appeal starts to curdle once Wright makes his fetishistic aims clear."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is everything we go to the movies for, as Gunn is able to build an intricate intergalactic world full of multiple races, lush scenery, and maximum escapism through action, romance, comedy, and interstellar drama."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Surrender, earthlings. It’s the Guardians’ world and you’ll be happy to live in it."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"It manages the trick of being both an unironic sci-fi action-adventure flick and a zippy parody of one. It’s exciting, funny, self-aware, beautiful to watch and even, for a flickering instant or two, almost touching."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,100,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is the most charming Marvel movie so far. The primary ensemble (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel) is perhaps the most winning group of characters they've introduced in any of these movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,Director James Gunn’s first foray into big-budget movie making succeeds despite focusing on characters largely unknown to mainstream audiences and provides some of the most genuinely affecting moments of any Marvel film to date.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,A perfectly irreverent counterpoint to movies that take their superheroes a bit too seriously.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,The film's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,91,[A] blend of classic sci-fi fare and current pop-culture irony is what rockets “Guardians” into the stratosphere.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,90,"Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you're not quite sure what's going on, the scruffy ""Guardians"" is irreverent in a way that can bring the first ""Star Wars"" to mind."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,90,"It's easy to get carried away with movies like this, which lend themselves to fanboy hype. It's not a perfect movie. But it is one that is hugely enjoyable, bears repeated viewings and will be as funny in 10 years (or 50) as it is now. And that's pretty swell."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,89,Marvel’s rambunctious entry into the space opera genre—and the cornerstone of its “Cosmic Marvel” roster of characters and storylines—so perfectly embodies what the preceding months of hype and hope foretold that even its weak points (and it has its share) feel almost like unavoidable imperfections—broken eggs for a pretty satisfying omelet.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"""Guardians” stands apart because it’s somehow truer to a comic book’s essence than any Marvel or DC-derived picture you can name. Which is to say it’s pulpy, kind of cheesy and giddily exaggerated (and aware of it) in a way that, say, the “Thors,” the “Captain Americas” and Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are not."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. It's insanely, shamelessly silly – just one reason to love it."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"Gunn makes this huge entertainment accessible to the converted and the neophyte alike, and he has only has one goal: To send you out of the theater with a fat smile on your face. Mission accomplished."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,88,"It’s filled with a kind of giddy energy that leaps off the screen. It’s corny, it’s dopey, it’s sincere, it’s romantic, it’s thrilling and it leaves one anticipating the next adventure of these heroic goofballs."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,83,"Gunn’s careful to keep the focus on the central five, but certainly proves himself capable of the bigger canvas. The film really pops visually, with an admirably bright color palette (DP Ben Davis doing excellent work), and though there are occasionally some geography issues, the action is mostly satisfying."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"The film, directed and co-written by James Gunn, is joyfully irreverent. Gunn lends his underachiever superheroes a geeky, comic camaraderie, and he brings a spry touch to the wacky intergalactic adventure."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"It is fast, it is fun."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"To see an expensive, big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence, it’s also fair to call it a marvel."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Gunn, a B-movie enthusiast who got his start at Troma, has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"As much as Guardians largely thrives through its lovably scuzzy style, it cannot avoid the immense tractor-beam pull of The Big Marvel Studios Final Act."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Overall this is giddy, ridiculous fun, a witty, wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a film."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Mad, marvellous and all kinds of sci-fi magical, Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel’s riskiest but most surprising success yet."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Guardians of the Galaxy is undoubtedly a flashy space opera, but if you are on board with that, it's a resounding success that takes a seat at Marvel's top table and suggests there could still be life after The Avengers."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"The fun of it – and Guardians of the Galaxy specialises in fun, served by the sugar-sprinkled ice-cream-scoopload – is in seeing this odd quintet bluster through space battles and alien brawls that would have defeated anyone smarter and better-equipped. Just as the team makes do with the junk they find around them, the film feels like a mound of gems culled from decades of pop-culture scavenging."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,80,"Overall, the writers have crafted a well-articulated universe with distinct settings and relatable, compelling characters devoted to a thrilling quest for redemption."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,78,"Guardians of the Galaxy is an outlier: a space opera in a largely earthbound movie cycle (excepting the occasional red-eye to another dimension in the Thor pictures), candy-colored and bopping where the other Marvel movies are muted and imposing, and the funniest one to date, without a doubt."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"What works best in Guardians is, in fact, the camaraderie of the team itself and the heart applied to their slowly gelling sense of family."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The gadgetry and fight scenes are nicely rendered. The aeronautical battles, though, fall well short of state-of-the-art. Maybe they're collateral damage to the film's goofy style."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Too loud, too long and too busy but – here’s the good part – also wonderfully silly."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The film’s fast, amusing, good-looking and not overlong, which is all sensible non-geeks ask of such movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"With its introduction of wonderfully memorable characters and blend of humor, action and catchy tunes, Guardians is perfectly pitched escapist fun."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"A fun and relatively fresh space Western. Think “Firefly” pitched at 15-year-olds, with a lot of overt ""Star Wars"" nods. And super-“irreverent” dialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The motley crew’s repartee makes for comedy that’s surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,The film owes its relative buoyancy above all to Chris Pratt as the wisecracking space rogue at the helm.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Guardians of the Galaxy is fun but forgettable, or perhaps Gunn crams so much onto the screen that memory is crowded out. Definitely worth a second look, just to figure out what in the name of Buckaroo Banzai is going on."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"The vibe, if not the specifics, is highly reminiscent of ""The Last Starfighter,"" ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" and others. The fact that the movie's ""present"" is defined as being 1988 and the soundtrack is peppered with '70s tunes cements the retro feeling."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Guardians boasts not one, but two Han Solo proxies — not to mention an ass-kicking Princess Leia surrogate, a villain with a very Sithian fashion sense, and the flora answer to Chewbacca. Also, one of the Han Solo types is a talking raccoon."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Laugh-out-loud funny and production-designed to death, Guardians of the Galaxy pops off the screen."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,75,"Though the special effects win the day, Guardians of the Galaxy holds court with a sense of humor that transcends its more familiar ingredients."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"The film’s scruffy, smartass band of brothers, along with Gunn’s light directorial touch, make for an invigorating breather after too many summer weekends of hammer-wielding superheroic solemnity."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself — because it seems capable of being so much more."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"A likable lightweight, though it's heavy enough on cosmic combat and dazzling effects."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"It’s a high-spirited, swashbuckling lark driven by cartoonish special effects and an ingenious double-layered nostalgia that allows it to become a virtual mixtape of ‘70s hits that predate its intended audience: “Hooked on a Feeling,” “The Piña Colada Song,” “Fooled Around and Fell in Love,” etc."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"Unlike the stiff-jawed heroics of the other Marvel films, this feels a little looser and lighter, with Pratt as charming, amoral accidental leader Peter Quill, an earthling among the stars who, as he will tell you, is also known as the roving brigand “Starlord.”"
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,70,"Director James Gunn’s presumptive franchise-starter is overlong, overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please, but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant — as does Chris Pratt’s winning performance as the most blissfully spaced-out space crusader this side of Buckaroo Banzai."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,63,"For every scene that soars into the dizzying heights of the pop sublime, there's another that crashes back down into the mundane troughs of studio-mandated formula."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,60,"The movie practically satirises itself as it goes along, glossing over its own absurdity in the process."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,It’s a bit of a botch.
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,"Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,50,"Gunn has to juggle so many plot elements — so many booming galactic battles, so many whisker-close brushes with death — that it's little wonder he loses his grip on the thing. He inserts occasional moments of wonder but doesn't bother to smooth over the seams."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8.1,333176600,25,"Guardians of the Galaxy brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.”"
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp—a fun but ultimately disposable entry in the studio’s catalogue. But Ryan Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Believe the hype: Black Panther transcends its comic-book origins, achieving a mythic grandeur that’s nothing short of exhilarating."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"One of the year's best films, and one that transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions. The numerous battle sequences that are staples of the genre are present, but they float on the surface of a deep ocean of character development and attention to details both grandiose and minute"
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,Marvel’s Black Panther is a milestone not only for its casting and director/co-writer Ryan Coogler’s cine-griot myth building but because it’s alive with fresh sights and sounds in a genre easily leaning on sameness.
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther is the film that will change everything. When you see it, you know that from here on in, everything will be different. Whilst a Marvel story through and through, fitting perfectly into the MCU post-Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther stands alone as a masterpiece of filmmaking."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"On a pure pop level, as a piece of big-time mainstream entertainment, let us also celebrate this: Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies of the century."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"A film that fulfills the most rote demands of superhero spectacle, yet does so with style and subtexts that feel bracingly, joyfully groundbreaking."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"Say this about Black Panther, which raises movie escapism very near the level of art: You've never seen anything like it in your life."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,100,"While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness (those aforementioned war rhinos), insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda, whose culture is steeped in African influences but which also offers a jaw-dropping look at what a city of the future could be."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,96,"The arguments Black Panther undertakes with itself are central to its architecture, a narrative spine that runs from the first scene to the last."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"It’s easily the best of the Marvel superhero movies but it’s also a film that foregrounds a cornucopia of powerful black faces, garbs, traditions, and conflicts. It’s a stealth movie: Like “Get Out,” it’s a genre film jam-packed with social relevancy."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"There’s talent in every corner of the film, and it elevates Black Panther beyond so many of its superhero contemporaries even as it exhibits some formulaic tendencies. It’s a sterling example of formula done exceedingly well, however, particularly in the ways it uses the familiarity of that formula to tell a new kind of story."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"It’s gripping, funny, and full of spectacle, but it also feels like a turning point, one where the studio has finally recognized that its movies can be about more than just selling the next installment. In the process, the studio has ended up with one of the most enthralling entries in its entire universe."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,91,"[Coogler] infuses nearly every frame with soul and style, and makes the radical case that a comic-book movie can actually have something meaningful — beyond boom or kapow or America — to say. In that context, Panther’s nuanced celebration of pride and identity and personal responsibility doesn’t just feel like a fresh direction for the genre, it’s the movie’s own true superpower."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Coogler and his talented cast and team tell a story that dazzles, one that dares its audience to dream of a world unrestrained by our own stifling reality, without ignoring how the pain of the real world informs those joyful dreams."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"It is a terrifically entertaining film, alive from the start, following its Marvel mission (for good and bad) while rising above it."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"The movie has a beating heart, and a big one; it’s not just sincere, but that rarest of birds in the jungle of mainstream entertainment, a heartfelt epic."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Energized to a thrilling extent by a myriad of Afrocentric influences, Black Panther showcases a vivid inventiveness that underscores the obvious point that we want all cultures and colors represented on screen because that makes for a richness of cinematic experience that everyone enjoys being exposed to."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"It wouldn’t be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars. Yet in its emphasis on black imagination, creation and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present. And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Unusually grounded for a Marvel superhero epic, and unusually gripping."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,90,"Black Panther delivers the goods as an adventure film, a political statement, and a cultural celebration. It shakes off a sluggish start thanks to a memorable cast of characters going up against Marvel’s best-realized villain in almost a decade."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,89,"Yes, Black Panther is a moment. But in 20 years' time (or 100 more Marvel films), when this moment has passed, it will still be the kind of resonant, rip-roaring crowd-pleaser to which all smart action films should aspire."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,This is the closest Marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years. Even Doctor Strange felt more connected to the larger MCU.
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"No, Black Panther isn’t the greatest movie ever made. It’s probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made. But it’s very, very good — in its best scenes, exhilarating."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Black Panther sticks to Marvel orthodoxy, and yet does so with a nearly all black cast (Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis have small roles), and with strikingly Afro-centric production design. In the process it freshens and enlivens the Marvel brand."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Like all the best comics movies, this one’s got a villain (Michael B. Jordan) so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero (Chadwick Boseman). And sure, the futuristic African country of Wakanda may be fictional, but it’s brimming with cultural resonance."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"May Marvel learn its lesson from Black Panther: When a movie like this ends up feeling both personal and vital, you’ve done something right."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Coogler is a young filmmaker — this is just his third feature, following “Fruitvale Station” and “Creed” (two fine and very different films) — but he marshals this world with confidence and flair. The action sequences are insanely fun."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"Unlike many of its more hollow predecessors, Black Panther has real, honest-to-goodness stakes. As the most earnest and big-budget attempt yet of a black superhero film, Black Panther is assured of being an overdue cinematic landmark. But it's also simply ravishing, grand-scale filmmaking."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,88,"When Black Panther works, it’s thrillingly alive, whether it’s the dazzling colors of the vivid costumes by Ruth E. Carter (“Selma”)...or the eclectic and vibrant music choices."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,85,"Black Panther works best as a dynastic drama, and as a musing on global politics from a perspective we don’t often get. Despite familiar action-scene wobbliness, it’s easily the most engaging Marvel film in a long while. Because—finally!—it has something new to say."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,85,"It’s obvious Ryan Coogler didn’t direct Black Panther to make an action movie. Instead, it’s a dense movie about family, community, internal struggle, and external struggle. And it’s a movie with a lot on its mind."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"While Ryan Coogler’s deep dive into the titular character’s Wakandan homeworld keeps the assembly line working, it heralds not only an improvement on the MCU, but a striking and grandiose fantasy in its own right."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"There are hiccups in its ambition, but it’s hard not to get swept up in all the technologies, characters, and politics crammed into the movie’s compelling dramatic conflict, which casts the charismatic Michael B. Jordan—the star of Creed and Coogler’s debut, Fruitvale Station—as the most complex villain in the post-Dark Knight cycle of superhero blockbusters."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"The murky moral dimension of the Black Panther world is wonderfully rich and complex and it gives great pause for its new king to reconcile. And yet, all this intricacy is resolved in rather simplistic fashion in the end. It’s just a superhero movie, one might say, but if you’re going to set up this fertile ground, you might want to really follow through."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,83,"Black Panther is different. It’s the first one of these films that flows with a genuine sense of culture and identity, memory and musicality. It’s the first one of these films that doesn’t merely reckon with power and subjugation in the abstract, but also gives those ideas actual weight by grafting them onto specific bodies and confronting the historical ways in which they’ve shaped our universe."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,82,Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director’s voice.
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"While Boseman does what he can with the ever-noble hero, Jordan is so relaxed and so unstiff that, if you’re anything like me, you’ll wind up rooting for the baddie when the two of them battle it out. Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there’s a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He’s twice as pantherish as the Panther."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs, allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Handsomely mounted by Creed director Ryan Coogler and starring an enviable slate of black actors that makes cameoing comics godhead Stan Lee almost seem lost, the film is provocative and satisfying in ways that are long overdue, like its ornate, culturally dense production design and the deeper subtexts of honor, compassion and destiny."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, Black Panther brings grounded history — in Black History Month, no less — to a fantastical story, carefully considering the world in which the characters reside."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Grumpy T'Challa may be on the throne, but it’s the women who rule. And Michael B. Jordan adds fire as Killmonger."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"The movie is smart, lavish and fun without being assaultive."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Confident, assured and athletic filmmaking. And with Boseman on such dignified, dynamic form, his Infinity War return can’t come soon enough."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Historical significance aside, what superhero fans want to know is how “Black Panther” compares with other Marvel movies. Simply put, it not only holds its own, but improves on the formula in several key respects, from a politically engaged villain to an emotionally grounded final showdown."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Like Taika Waititi before him, Ryan Coogler gives the Marvel template a bold auteurist twist with an African extravaganza that packs a muscular intensity and challenges as much as it exhilarates."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed) has fashioned a slightly more earnest variation on the typical MCU movie — one that is still fun and funny, but also rooted in a desire to speak meaningfully about racism, global culture clashes, and the tension between hiding behind one’s borders and helping outsiders in need."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"The actors are all seen to very good advantage. Boseman certainly holds his own, but there are quite a few charismatic supporting players here keen to steal every scene they can — and they do, notably the physically imposing Jordan, the radiant Nyong'o and especially Wright, who gives her every scene extra punch and humor."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"While many Marvel films, even some of the good ones, feel like small pieces of a larger story, Black Panther is an entire cinematic universe unto itself."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesn’t look like a superhero film – more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,80,"As with Jordan Peele’s Get Out, or Coogler’s 2015 Rocky spin-off Creed, Black Panther isn’t a novelty, but a fresh perspective on a well-worn format. Not to get all Rosa Parks about it, but the film walks into the multiplex like it’s insane that it hasn’t been allowed in there all along. And it is."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,75,"Black Panther fights constantly and bitterly against the familiar constraints of Disney's superhero industrial complex. At every turn, the expectations of the genre, the bland sameness that breeds cinematic comfort for the millions who line up to fill Marvel's coffers, are met by the director with resistance and creative intensity."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,75,"Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it’s only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn’t have been a sure thing. The Black Panther is a superhero with lots of uncertainty."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,75,"Michel B. Jordan plays Erik Killmonger with such moving, occasionally gut-wrenching commitment that it nearly mitigates the goofiness of his moniker and the superficiality of the film in toto."
Black Panther,7.3,700059566,63,"Whatever its cultural significance, it’s just passable entertainment, a noble attempt at waxing mythical that never, for one second, delivers that out-of-body giddiness that makes popcorn pictures of its ilk burst to life."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,88,"Any movie with the sense, the wit and the visual instincts to introduce Kong the way this one does is fine with me."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,83,"Kong: Skull Island is an offering to the hungry mouths at the multiplex who want to cheer a movie that doesn't insult, or tax, their intelligence."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,83,"It also cannot be overstated what an asset [John C.] Reilly is. The moment he shows up, the movie feels enlivened and energized; his mere presence adds a tremendous amount of oddball charm and humor."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"The picture is grand and nutty and visually splendid: Vogt-Roberts knows he's gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"The new Kong: Skull Island really gets it right — the exotic adventure, the spectacular special effects, the towering terrors. It’s a big hunk of nostalgic fun, reminding us of the 1933 original even as it monkeys around with the classic story."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,The surprise is that “Skull Island” isn’t just ten times as good as “Jurassic World”; it’s a rousing and smartly crafted primordial-beastie spectacular.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"A large part of the enjoyment comes down to the sheer earth-shaking lunacy of Kong’s daily grind, even before the human intruders are factored in."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"This highly entertaining return of one of the cinema's most enduring giant beasts moves like crazy — the film feels more like 90 minutes than two hours — and achieves an ideal balance between wild action, throwaway humor, genre refreshment and, perhaps most impressively, a nonchalant awareness of its own modest importance in the bigger scheme of things."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,80,"Kong: Skull Island is a grand cinematic adventure powered by furry fury, as the horrors of war blend with chest-beating creature confidence."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,The action and special effects are mostly first-rate and Vogt-Roberts maintains a vaguely satiric tone that sidesteps schlockiness.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"It is the platonic ideal of big, smart-dumb B-movie filmmaking – and, like Kong himself, it must be seen to be believed."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"If Reilly’s presence gives Kong: Skull Island its playful, gonzo edge, it’s the title character himself who gives it soul, morphing from a monster into a brooding symbol of the colossal folly of military belligerence and hegemonic hubris."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"If you’re looking for a film that offers pure escapism, Kong: Skull Island should definitely meet expectations."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"In this digital world that allows for Kong to be as big as a building and believably so, Roberts is smart to pull out all the stops. And if some of the story and character motivation gets left in the dust, so be it."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island is fast, playful and ridiculous, a big-budget extravaganza with the soul of a spirited B-movie."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island isn’t a remake or a reboot or a re-anything. It’s just a Saturday matinee creature feature with a smart, unpretentious script, a handful of solid supporting players, and a digital Kong who feels big enough and real enough to provoke the necessary awe. This is all to the movie’s credit."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"The monsters are brilliantly designed and skillfully animated (except for a few shots where Kong looks a tad cartoony), and the army of visual and sound effects artists convince you that that these CGI titans live and breathe and weigh hundreds of tons."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,It’s wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Kong: Skull Island is a smart SciFi action movie that doesn’t rely on a handful of monsters and random scenes of computerized destruction to run out the clock. It has a smart script, imaginative filmmaking and a cast of fine actors that actually get to act."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"The dialogue is clunky, the A-list actors are slumming and, yeah, you've seen it all before. But Kong: Skull Island is a creature feature that's damn near irresistible."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,Skull Island has a lot of globe-trotting fun assembling its team of expendables.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,75,"Perhaps the most satisfying thing about the film is what comes after, when you stop to realize how darkly comic and sickly fun the film was after you’re done reeling from all the impaling and dismemberment."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,70,"In the struggle between sober subtext and monster-movie goofiness, the goofiness mostly wins out."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,67,"Hiddleston and Larson are especially let down by the script, which wants to be jokey in the way that something like Predator was, but can’t pull it off. The same lack of care goes into the period-specific song choices that have as much imagination as a Time-Life Songs of the ‘70s set."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,65,"It lacks neither fun nor polish, but it has the square tidiness of a compartmentalized fast-food meal."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,"As a big-budget B-grade monster movie, Kong: Skull Island is a home run. It offers all the tropes and clichés one expects from this sort of endeavor, sparing no expense when it comes to special effects. As a King Kong movie, however, Skull Island is less successful."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,"Kong: Skull Island won’t win any points for the brilliance of its writing (or for the way it reduces a terrific actor like Larson to a personality-free camera-clicker) — but oh, that ape"
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,63,It’s when there's a distinct lack of King Kong that Skull Island turns into a plodding affair.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"Story and soul are never going to be kings on Skull Island, but they could have fared better than this."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"“Skull Island” has momentum, polish and behemoths that slither and thunder. The sets and creature designs are often beautifully filigreed, but the larger picture remains murky."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"It's a heck of a cast, although the hands-down scene-stealer is John C. Reilly, in a gem of a comic-relief role that, in the interest of remaining spoiler-free, is probably best undescribed here."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"Kong: Skull Island is one of those movies best described as big, dumb fun."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,Derivative and a little dumb but consistently fun: there’s personality and panache to spare in this monster blockbuster.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"If the film belongs to anyone, it’s creature designer Carlos Huante. Kong is expressive and impressive, both in hair and full-body movement, and his interaction – with water, humans, other animals – is consistently fluid."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,King Kong lives! But only just. This is an uneven adventure that’s saved by the spectacle of its towering title character and the various beasts with whom he shares his island home.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"For all its updated bluster, this update still can’t escape the shadow of 1933’s magical King Kong."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,60,"This is a creature feature, plain and simple — and, at least on a visceral level, a satisfying one."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,58,"Kong: Skull Island strips the beauty from a legendary beast, reducing a classic movie star to soulless monster mechanics. Kong smashes, but not much else. Whoever dies doesn't matter. Whoever lives has a sequel promised by the end credits."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,58,"Kong: Skull Island may include some clever period details and idiosyncratic asides, but it’s largely a blockbuster B-movie less interested in depth than scale."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"Where Hiddleston seems perfectly at home in the digital trenches, gamely swinging at fiendish foes to be added in postproduction, Larson looks like she’s staring into thin air. That leaves us with the monsters, who are, to be fair, mightily impressive."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"On the whole, though, Kong: Skull Island is great big dumb fun. It’s also shockingly beautiful to look at when you aren’t having creature guts flung into the camera."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,Vogt-Roberts never develops the characters enough to make us care whether anyone lives or dies and never whips up even a flirtation between Hiddleston and Larson.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"It’s “Avatar” simplistic, glib and dumb and not nearly as funny as they seem to think it is."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,50,"The thing that breaks the back of this movie, and makes the second half so much less prodigious than the first, is a simple matter of geography. Once the combatants are split up and scattered around the island (Packard here, Chapman there, Conrad and Marlow stuck in their own heart of darkness), the story loses focus and even starts to drag."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,Its combination of lavishness and lack of imagination is the only thing memorable about it.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,"I’ve gone on about the creatures because there’s so little to say about the humans, who, in their turn, have little to say about the creatures, because the writers haven’t written enough lively dialogue."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,40,"Caution should always be taken when branding any film about an 80-foot ape ""illogical"", but such is the gross stupidity of the film's movable feast - and the abominable dialogue spewing from their mouths - that you'll likely thank the primate deity himself every time one is crushed, impaled or bisected."
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,25,Every creature here that's intended to burrow themselves into the audience’s nightmares are less wonders of imagination than of size.
Kong: Skull Island,6.6,168052812,20,"This fantastically muddled and exasperatingly dull quasi-update of the King Kong story looks like a zestless mashup of Jurassic Park, Apocalypse Now and a few exotic visual borrowings from Miss Saigon. It gets nowhere near the elemental power of the original King Kong or indeed Peter Jackson’s game remake; it’s something Ed Wood Jr might have made with a trillion dollars to do what he liked if he’d been given a trillion dollars – but minus the fun."
Venom,6.7,213515506,75,This leaves the viewer with two choices: reject the parasite or let it take you over. Fight it off and you’ll have a bad time; become one with it and you may achieve a kind of symbiosis.
Venom,6.7,213515506,70,"The action is dumb, the plot is weak, and the story is pitiful. Venom is a bad movie, yet surprisingly I still loved the hell out of it."
Venom,6.7,213515506,70,"For several weird stretches, though, Venom is a bouncy good time. The movie doesn’t seem to care if you’re laughing with it, at it, or whatever. Just as long as you’re engaged, rollicking along as it doles out fan-service while still making a gleeful hash of so many serious franchise movies about very silly things."
Venom,6.7,213515506,63,"It's a mess, but wow, is it ever a fun, fascinating mess. Those are always so much more thrilling than any of the formulaic superhero movies that parade through multiplexes all year."
Venom,6.7,213515506,60,"Much of the picture falls flat, but the Eddie/Venom dynamic is aces and lives up to the Zombieland legacy."
Venom,6.7,213515506,60,"Fleischer made a better comedy-horror with Zombieland, but Venom’s a decent buddy actioner. You might even laugh your head off."
Venom,6.7,213515506,58,"Venom isn’t quite bad, but it’s not exactly good either. It’s noncommittally mediocre and, as a result, forgettable. It just sort of sits there, beating you numb, unsure of whether it wants to be a comic-book movie or put the whole idea of comic-book movies in its crosshairs."
Venom,6.7,213515506,55,"Venom is, at its heart, a will-they-won’t-they story—a grisly meet-cute between a down-on-his-luck reporter and a grumpy, gloppy little extra-terrestrial with a really big appetite. That’s good, because the movie is barely competent as an action flick."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"Neither the most super-awesome Marvel movie nor the worst. It exists in that micro-millimeter’s breadth of in-between. Venom has energy, style and Tom Hardy — all good things. But it doesn’t really make sense, a bad thing."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"The film’s off-kilter schizophrenia gives it a madcap appeal. While Fleischer seems to have a darker, moodier film in mind, Hardy has the good sense to steer Venom in a more over-the-top direction, even if the movie around him can’t catch up."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"As a symbiote, Brock/Venom is sometimes funny, and for a while the movie finds a rhythm that seems to suit director Ruben Fleischer, best known for Zombieland."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"In the end, Venom exists in what may end up being regarded as a no-man’s land — too much like a superhero movie to appeal to people who despise the genre, and yet too deliberately silly to be taken seriously by superhero fans. There’s nothing memorable in Venom, nothing to talk about the next day. But if it happens to hit you right, its lightness is refreshing."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"To the extent that Venom works, it’s as a comedy not an action/adventure superhero film."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"Ultimately, the ingratiating eccentricities of Venom aren’t enough to really distinguish the movie from its superhero-movie brethren as it devolves into the usual expensive orgy of sound, fury and wisecracking."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"So of course, Hardy applies that same intensity to the comic-book anti-hero origin story, Venom. And his fully committed performance is pretty much the only reason to see it."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"The best moments toy with a kind of superhero body horror, but the movie never fully commits to that angle, maybe to appease a ratings board and perceived audience of 13-year-olds (isn’t that who Venom was designed to please?), or maybe because director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) is more interested in the comic possibilities than the horrific ones."
Venom,6.7,213515506,50,"Like his hungry symbiote latching onto Eddie, Fleischer cunningly fastens a malicious irreverence onto an otherwise lacklustre superhero movie. But the symbiosis doesn’t quite take."
Venom,6.7,213515506,42,"To be honest, Venom’s almost worth watching for Hardy’s bizarre accent and whirling-dervish mania alone, but it’s a shame he’s not surrounded by a better, more exciting film."
Venom,6.7,213515506,42,"It’s a cliché to praise a film by saying that an actor “is having fun” on screen, but Hardy having fun with a weirdly bland character and his absurd, sassy alter ego goes a long way to giving Venom a reason to exist."
Venom,6.7,213515506,41,"It’s a train wreck of a movie, mixing and matching wildly dissonant tones, bizarre plot contrivances, and a truly unique lead performance."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"At least the CGI is clever, the consistency of Venom’s viscous, hostless form moving between molten metal and melted chewing gum."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,Venom is a desperately confused piece of work which has only a few compensatory pleasures to offer along the way.
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Despite a commendably committed performance from Tom Hardy (whether it's a good or bad one will still need further evaluation), Venom's a big, stinking gooey mess of a film."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"No one can accuse Hardy of giving Venom anything less than his absolute best. He has always been a performer who loves a good affectation; here he seems to be riffing on his performance as Max Rockatansky in ""Mad Max: Fury Road."""
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Venom wants to be something different, an off-kilter dark comedy whose protagonist doesn’t need to be cleaned up so he can fight alongside Iron Man someday. But it’s also terrified to step out of line, and the stench of fear overwhelms whatever wisps of fresh air have sneaked through the cracks in the doorway."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Entertainingly, Hardy lets himself get jerked around, Evil Dead–style, but he’s never enough of a jerk—so much for that journo-snoop backstory—and Venom isn’t vicious enough to justify its own existence."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Venom is neither triumph nor train-wreck. It’s a mediocre origin story, a superhero host that sadly fails to bond with its comedy parasite. Which is a shame, as there is enough here to to suggest it could have been a blast."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"If you are going to Venom for cool superhero action — or for compelling characters, pulpy science-fiction, impressive special effects, a parable about corporations run amok, or a single significant connection to Spider-Man — you will be sorely disappointed. If you can look past all of that (and the dreadful first hour), your reward is Hardy, delivering one of the all-time great unhinged performances."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"I do want to make it clear that I think Venom is not a good movie, but I also want to make it clear that I had the time of my life watching it. I think in a couple of years Venom could be the type of movie that sells out midnight showings as people come up to the screen and act out their favorite parts."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Directed with flat, joyless competence by Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland,” “Gangster Squad”), “Venom” brings with it a laborious, decades-spanning development history. A movie this long in the works should arrive on-screen feeling like more than just an afterthought."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Venom is a textbook case of a comic-book film that’s unexciting in its ho-hum competence, and even its visual-effects bravura."
Venom,6.7,213515506,40,"Tom Hardy’s committed performance can’t overcome a painful script and indecisive direction, resulting in a film with a personality that’s as split as its titular character. There are occasional moments of brilliance in the dynamic between Eddie and Venom that give a hint of what the film could have been in steadier hands, but ultimately, that only makes the finished product a more frustrating viewing experience."
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,"Venom, the movie, is a reptilian Marvel mishmash whose touch saps the life force of almost everyone in it."
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,A picture in the running for the dubious distinction of being perhaps the worst Marvel-derived origin story ever.
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,"Tom Hardy is one of the best actors in the world, but as he flounders his way through Venom, we’re reminded even the finest talents can sink under the weight of a terrible movie."
Venom,6.7,213515506,38,"I mean, we all love Tom Hardy, but he can’t break through in this thinly-scripted, dully acted and badly directed Marvel comic brought to life."
Venom,6.7,213515506,30,"The direction by Ruben Fleischer (Zomebieland, Gangster Squad) is oddly slapdash, and hardly does justice to the skills of his cast or his own chops as a comedic filmmaker. Hardy squeezes some baffled comedy out of his schizoid shtick, but there just isn’t much here for him to work with."
Venom,6.7,213515506,25,The final act's full-tilt embrace of action effectively undermines Tom Hardy's flashes of actorly idiosyncrasy.
Venom,6.7,213515506,25,"“Venom”? More like cyanide. The latest movie off the Marvel assembly line is a disaster on every level, from the hatchet-job writing to the horrid performances. Like so many recent superhero movies, Venom has put its focus on juvenile humor instead of heart or action."
Venom,6.7,213515506,25,"Venom isn’t sure what film it wants to be, and it makes for an unintelligible, queasy roller coaster ride."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"This year gave us the best and most imaginative Marvel film in ""Black Panther."" Now we have the worst."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"Venom can be quite a lively watch, both as a reminder of why Hollywood stopped making superhero films like this, and also for the occasional glimpse of the off-the-wall, star-driven freak-out that might have been.... But in terms of basic entertainment, let alone as the foundation of a franchise, it is miserably shaky stuff."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"Venom feels like a throwback, a poor second cousin to the all-stars that have reliably dominated the box-office charts for most of this century. Partly, this is due to the fact that, as an origin story, this one seems rote and unimaginative. On top of that, the writing and filmmaking are blah in every respect; the film looks like an imitator, a wannabe, not the real deal."
Venom,6.7,213515506,20,"There are in fact one or two big gags, but no real sense of fun - not compared to something like Thor: Ragnarok. Director Ruben Fleischer, who made Zombieland and Gangster Squad, is uninspired. Venom is riddled with the poison of dullness."
Venom,6.7,213515506,15,"It exists as a waste of time (although, one hopes, a sizable payday) for some very talented actors, and it’s proof that even Marvel doesn’t always get it right."
Venom,6.7,213515506,12,"Where to even begin with Venom, a film that had me laughing at it so hard I started crying. A horribly scripted film so bad as to be enjoyable, but not bad enough to be good."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,88,"Compared to its ilk, Suicide Squad is an excellently quirky, proudly raised middle finger to the staid superhero-movie establishment."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,83,"Suicide Squad is not the darkest mainstream superhero comic book movie ever made, nor is it even the darkest live-action film featuring Batman ever made. However, it is gleefully nihilistic, and it takes a different approach to what has become a fairly familiar story form at this point, right at the moment when it feels like superhero movies either have to evolve or die."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,80,"In the end, the characters are more lasting than the story, which is a standard save-the-city-from-destruction yarn. But this crew is a riot, and their world is intriguing and even a little meaningful."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,80,"Like Avengers Assemble forced through a Deadpool mangle, Suicide Squad gives new life to DC’s big-screen universe. So bad-to-the-bone it’s good."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,70,"David Ayer's film may not always work, but when it does, it's a perverse delight."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,67,"Writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) skillfully sets up the film, introducing each of the crazies with caffeinated comic-book energy. But their mission...is a bit of a bust. The stakes should feel higher."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,63,"Suicide Squad had the potential to be as hilariously irreverent as “Deadpool,” a surprise box-office hit about a similarly sociopathic hero. Instead, it’s just another film that relies on special effects to distract the audience from a story that’s overblown and underwhelming."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,63,"Suicide Squad prides itself on being “dark,” but it’s really just jokey, cynical, and violent, not to mention visually ugly as sin. It’s as subversive as milk. But the cast and the pacing keep it moving."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,63,Suicide Squad does have quite a few tremendously entertaining sequences of high action and low comedy. It's a shame it never rises beyond that.
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,63,"“The Dirty Dozen,” one of my favorite war movies, will no doubt get a 50th-anniversary boxed set next year. Those of us who wait for it can mark time with Suicide Squad, which borrows the same concept and executes it with more lunacy and far less flair."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,63,"It’s Harley Quinn’s movie and everybody else in Suicide Squad is just a supporting character. No surprise there. That’s the way it is in the comic books, too. It’s all about personality, and Harley has that by the freight carload."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,60,"When it comes down to it, there's one overriding factor that lessens the impact of the film's numerous stumbles, and that's this: It's just plain entertaining to see all these warped characters, and all these well-cast actors, bouncing off of one another, interacting with one another, and creating a barely controlled chaos."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,60,"Suicide Squad is a so-so, off-peak superhero movie. It chases after the nihilistic swagger of “Deadpool” and the anarchic whimsy of “Guardians of the Galaxy” but trips over its own feet."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,60,"It’s probably best to think of Suicide Squad as a primer, an entry into a side world of the DC Universe that may pay bigger benefits in later films. It certainly seems like that’s how the filmmakers thought of it."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,60,"It’s a clotted and delirious film, with flashes of preposterous, operatic silliness. But it doesn’t have much room to breathe; there are some dull bits, and Leto’s Joker suffers in comparison with the late Heath Ledger."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,60,"Starts off flavourful, turns rather bland. This Injustice League jaunt proves that DC is still a long way behind Marvel for on-screen action."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,60,Fans will probably appreciate Suicide Squad for trying something different — and it gets bonus points for diversity — but the weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies.
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,58,"Like so many of Ayer’s directorial efforts, Suicide Squad feels like it was re-drafted in the editing room. It’s clumsy, disrupted by at least eight different plodding flashbacks, filled with lines of dialogue that cut well into trailers but make zero sense in context, and patched up with an embarrassment of rock-along musical cues."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,58,"It's the garish swarm of colorfully twisted action that Batman v Superman needed, the anarchic approach such timeworn superheroes deserve. Suicide Squad characters aren't nearly as familiar, so writer-director David Ayer's movie is also messy, not entirely by design."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,50,"Regrettably, the film’s place-setting opening lays the scene for a different, more exciting film that never really unfolds."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,50,"It gets props for kinetic energy, bursts of suspense, and a couple of bravura performances (Will Smith & Margot Robbie). But pretty much everything else is either mediocre or substandard and that makes it hard to champion this bloated and cheerless monstrosity."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,50,"Suicide Squad is a concept in search of a story worth telling. Both energized and betrayed by its “Worst.Heroes.Ever” theme and writer-director David Ayer’s trademark visceral filmmaking, it ends up in a kind of limbo, not as strong as partisans will insist or as worthless as its weakest elements would have you believe."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,50,"Writer-director David Ayer tries hard to make this dirty not-quite-dozen into an engaging band of misfits, but the results feel undercooked and overstuffed, with 10 pounds of supervillain backstory being crammed into a five-pound bag."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,50,Suicide Squad does have its moments of beautiful comic-book visuals.... Those are just tantalizing hints of a better movie that never materialized.
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,50,"The action beats are taut, but the story arc crumbles under the weight of all the movies it steals from. The casting fails to pop, in most instances."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,45,"The film doesn't go far enough in setting its own course. Ayer works to establish those villains as gleeful fantasies of unfettered freedom, then fetters them with maudlin backstories that make them all sad, soulful, misused, and misunderstood."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,42,"Writer-director David Ayer doesn’t have the right graphic technique for a comic-book-style jamboree – he’s strictly a noirish-pulp guy – and the characters, all of whom are promisingly introduced, fizzle fast."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,42,"Instead of focusing on the squad in the title — the chemistry the audience wants to see — Ayer doubles down on the usual DC tics: dark fights, a humdrum dependence on guns and fists, a cynical everyone-sucks grasp of politics, and sudden rain showers that people ignore. It’s moody and mindless, an angry toddler screaming over his parents’ classic rock mix of The Rolling Stones, The Animals, and a 14-year-old song from Eminem."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,42,"Muddled characters and uneven storytelling are the roots of the issues here, but the ways in which Ayer seems to try to cover up his film’s deficiencies grate most of all."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,42,"For all of the film’s nonstop, aggressive insistence on its subversive qualities, it’s about as radical and unconventional as a teenager buying a Leftover Crack shirt with their mom’s credit card from Amazon."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,42,"Suicide Squad isn’t a terrible movie per se and judged against its forbearer, ‘Batman v Superman,’ it resembles a shining beacon of coherence. But Suicide Squad isn’t a very good movie either, a mediocre effort with commonplace ideas of rebelliousness and salvation."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,40,"Despite its claims to zaniness and colouring outside the lines, probably the most damning indictment of the silly Suicide Squad is that it's unrelentingly bland."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,40,"There’s no one to root for in this movie, and no one whose prospects we care about. Several plot points lack coherence, and inserted flashbacks add to a sense of the film having been fused into shape in the editing room. It seems that Suicide Squad was done in by its own hand."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,40,"On paper, this could have been the antidote to an increasingly codified strain of comic-book movies, but in the end, it’s just another high-attitude version of the same."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,40,"When you compare Suicide Squad to what James Gunn and Marvel Studios achieved in Guardians of the Galaxy – low-profile property, oddball characters, make-it-fun brief – the film makes you cringe so hard your teeth come loose. But it’s a slog even on its own crushingly puerile terms."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,40,"A puzzlingly confused undertaking that never becomes as cool as it thinks it is, Suicide Squad assembles an all-star team of supervillains and then doesn’t know what to do with them."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,40,"Boasting a darker, more nihilistic streak than the typical comic-book film, this Warner Bros. release has its kinky pleasures and some amusing nastiness, but in the final analysis there’s simply too much flexing of empty attitude — and far too much self-congratulation for how edgy it thinks it is."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,38,"If it has a genius for anything, it’s disorganization: What promised to be a Super Bowl of villainy turned out more like toddler playtime."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,38,"With a few, rare exceptions, the attempts at humor in “Suicide Squad” land with a thud—that is, if you can hear such a sound over the deafening din of gunfire and the bombastic score."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,38,"But folks, this is a lousy script, blobby like the endlessly beheaded minions of the squad's chief adversary. It's not satisfying storytelling; the flashbacks roll in and out, explaining either too much or too little, and the action may be violent but it's not interesting."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,37,"Sadly, Suicide Squad feels like a watered-down version of what could have been a stiff drink."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,33,"Suicide Squad never has the courage of its convictions — it doesn’t own anything. At best, Ayer rents some pre-existing pop iconography and charges us $15 to watch him take it around the block for a spin. Forget the “Worst. Heroes. Ever.” These guys don’t even know how to be bad."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,30,"To say that the movie loses the plot would not be strictly accurate, for that would imply that there was a plot to lose, and that Ayer, in a forgetful moment, left it in the glove compartment of his car on the way to the studio."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,30,"Suicide Squad’s only triumph may be that it manages to make Batman v Superman look better by comparison. Bloated and baffling as that film was, it at least had a coherent aesthetic—a morose aesthetic, to be sure, but an aesthetic all the same. Suicide Squad, by contrast, is little more than a drab patchwork, its stitching the only thing uglier than the cloth."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,30,"The visuals in the final battle have some charm: They reminded me of early Tsui Hark Hong Kong extravaganzas like Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain and A Chinese Ghost Story (which he produced). But there was passion in those HK pictures, along with acrobatic wire-work. Promiscuous CGI makes even the miraculous seem ho-hum."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,30,"Harley Quinn’s entrance is the best moment in Suicide Squad. After that, you can leave. Robbie is a criminally appealing actress, likable in just about every way, but that intro aside, Suicide Squad doesn’t serve her well. It serves no one well, least of all its audience."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,30,"From the first scene to the last, it’s an absolute mess."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,25,"Like the recruited criminals themselves, the film longs to be bad, yet its forced by outside pressures to follow narrow, preset rules."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,25,"There isn’t a moment of spontaneous fun or humor in this long, turgid movie, the latest let-down for rabid DC Comics fans who’ve been waiting for someone to pick up the baton Christopher Nolan left behind and do this universe justice. With “Suicide Squad,” the long wait continues."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,25,"Suicide Squad wussies out when it should have been down with the Dirty Dozen of DC Comics. Audiences complained that Batman v Superman was too dark and depressing. So director-writer David Ayer (End of Watch, Fury) counters with light and candy-assed. I call bullshit."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,20,"Decadence is supposed to be fun, surely, or at least more fun than the desperate, sludgy, frantic mess of Suicide Squad."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,0,"In a word, Suicide Squad is trash. In two words, it’s ugly trash."
Suicide Squad,6.0,325100054,0,"It’s the kind of torment you can wish on your worst enemy without feeling too guilty, not something to inflict permanent damage, just two hours of soul-sickening confusion and sensory torment."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,88,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,88,"A whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't just go to 11, it starts there."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,83,"Whedon has more on his mind than he did in the last one. The Avengers seem not just contentious toward each other but weary, sick of their brutal responsibilities."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,83,"As usual, psychological anguish is a key element of Marvel heroes. Age of Ultron boasts a cast of actors that ""serious"" filmmakers would kill for, so the gravitas they're capable of conveying amid such outlandish fantasy is the franchise's stealth advantage."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,83,"This is a movie that is almost exhaustingly large-scale, and Ultron's ultimate plan involves a crazy visual idea that Whedon makes sort of beautiful and eerie. It's got so much action that I'm going to bet some audiences go numb after a while. But in scene after scene, there are beats and stunts and poses that suggest that an army of comic book fanatics worked on this movie."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"If anything, Whedon’s writing is almost too sharp. The characters are so finely drawn and verbally quick (they name-check Banksy and Eugene O’Neill) that they seem to belong to a different universe than the cartoonish one they find themselves in."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Whedon’s handling of the personal material is what makes Age Of Ultron extraordinary. Remarkably for a film so overstuffed, no character gets neglected."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a kinetic, wicked mix of muscle and magic. Look no further if you want a world of superpowered freaks and geeks. But be aware: It comes at a cost. Vaporized in the parade of action and characters is the wonder and simplicity of its first, superior entry."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"With Avengers: Age of Ultron, Whedon doesn't merely hit it out of the park, he Hulk-smashes it."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"It’s the interplay between the film’s many different characters, rather than the blow-up-the-world crisis they’re trying to defuse, that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Part horror, part love story, part morality tale, Age Of Ultron is a smart superhero smackdown that raises the bar once more."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"It’s all operatically mad, and the city-destroying final confrontation is becoming a bit familiar, but Whedon carries it off with such joy and even a kind of evangelism."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"The new movie is a sleeker, faster, funnier piece of work — the sort of sequel (like “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” “Superman II” and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” before it) that shrugs off the self-seriousness of its predecessor and fully embraces its inner Saturday-morning serial."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,80,"Bigger and, yes, darker than the first, this is less air-punchingly gleeful but probably more consistent. Thanks to Whedon and the most charismatic, compelling cast you’ll find anywhere, Age of Ultron redefines the scale we can expect from our superhero epics but still fits human-sized emotion amid the bombast."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,78,"It is the product of a machine perfectly evolved for the sole purpose of annihilating boredom, a machine whose primary weakness is the utter indifference of those uninitiated or unimpressed by this point. For the rest of us, it’s a hearty helping of fine."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"As I sat slavishly (and needlessly) through the entire end credit roll, it was hard to muster anything more fervent than ""Yeah, it was pretty good."" Even a clean, white hate would have somehow been more satisfying."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"Age of Ultron has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"Whedon knows this is all nonsense, but it can be great fun, too. Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"In its lumpy-porridge way, this film makes a better case than any other Marvel picture for the notion that quarter-billion-dollar-budgeted, CGI-festooned slabs of multimedia synergy can be art, too, provided they're made by an artist with a vision, and said artist appears to be in control of at least part of the production."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,75,"It may well be that we’ll eventually stop looking at these Marvel films as discrete, individual experiences rather than chapters in an epic binge-watch, but even by those standards, Avengers: Age of Ultron feels like a solid but overstuffed episode, one more concerned with being connective tissue than anything else."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,70,"There is much to like about Avengers: Age of Ultron. There was much to love about ""The Avengers,"" and therein lies the difference."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,70,"I enjoyed Age of Ultron more than its predecessor, despite the fact that it’s almost exactly the same thing. This was probably a result of adjusting my expectations: I wasn’t sitting there waiting for Whedon to revolutionize the genre, or to turn an overdetermined comic-book movie into a Noel Coward comedy. He delivers a clean and capable entertainment, with a handful of distinctive flourishes stuck to the margins."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,70,"Whedon and his large, capable cast (even larger for this follow-up) deliver enough adventure, laughs and flat-out spectacle to ensure that audiences will feel as if they have gotten their money’s worth, especially when Ultron zeroes in on the quiet humanity beneath the special effects."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"The action sequences aren’t especially well designed, and the plot, such as it is, is essentially one catastrophe after another."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"There’s so much ground to cover here—so many introductions to make, so much story to churn through, so many gargantuan set pieces to mount—that the movie never really finds room to breathe."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"Still, my real beef with these movies — and this one in particular — is how same-y they’ve started to feel. Each time out, everything is at stake and nothing is at stake."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,67,"For all its bluster, end-of-doom stakes, gravitas and super-seriousness, what Whedon’s movie does best is communicate its concern for the all the human beings touched by this story: the broken, nearly shattered heroes, their extended families and even the civilians caught in the crosshairs."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"As he did in the first “Avengers,” writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book ­self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"Ultron’s goals never make much sense beyond the basic kill-the-Avengers-and-destroy-the-Earth checklist, nor does he develop as a character over the long haul. He’s just a static baddie, fun to look at and handy with a quip but ultimately as dull as unpolished chrome."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"Entertaining as much of Avengers 2 is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" lesson, learned), Whedon’s picture meets expectations without exceeding them."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,Whedon can’t quite work the same miracle twice. Age of Ultron also bears the familiar stretch marks characteristic of middle movies in franchise series.
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"The thrill of the new, the delight in discovering how light on their feet and how trippingly the Whedon one-liners can fall off
the tongue, is fading. A bloated blockbuster movie-as-commodity like Age of Ultron doesn’t herald the end of this franchise or genre. But you can see it from here."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,63,"Director Joss Whedon knows how to make a wryly funny, action-packed extravaganza, as he proved with 2012's ""The Avengers."" So why did he overstuff the 2½-hour sequel?"
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Though a mess by all conventional narrative standards, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a fascinating case study in the rules of “universe” storytelling. Chief among them is that a film may not be self-contained — it must constantly allude to worlds outside its own. Marvel fans want extra characters, extra subplots, in-jokes that pander to their supposed breadth of knowledge. They don’t want closure."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"For a Marvel agnostic like me, the single most interesting thing about Age of Ultron is that you can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first “Avengers,” has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"The uncomfortable reality remains that although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace almost as soon as it's consumed."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Age of Ultron -- for all the eye candy and mindless entertainment it has to offer -- stays safely within the franchise's established parameters. Here, there are no real surprises."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Age of Ultron, then, shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedon’s imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth). And the result is, indeed, paradoxical: a crashy, overlong, FX-driven blockbuster that’s capable of morphing, Hulk-to-Banner style, into a loose-limbed ensemble comedy about collaboration, flirtation, and friendship."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"[Whedon] wants to give us everything, and that he fits it all in is its own kind of feat. Age of Ultron is a middling film, yet it's so heavy with his sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in — which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Whedon has revealed that his first cut ran for well over three hours, and it shows: Ultron feels excessively nipped and tucked, barrelling from one explosive set-piece to the next, leaving ideas half-formed and character motivations murky."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Avengers: Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no-man's-land."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,60,"Whereas ""The Avengers"" felt like a reimagining of the paradigm for superhero movies, Age of Ultron has air of a rerun. Though impressively made and visually remarkable, it suffers from the hollowness that plagues so many blockbusters carrying the sense that we've been through this before."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,58,"Whedon keeps approaching ideas, but every time he does so he leaves a flaming bag of dog poop on the doorstep, rings the bell and runs away tittering."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,50,"First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn’t worth the sweat."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7.3,459005868,50,"Supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,100,"There are moments of genuine pathos, genuine humor, genuine surprise. As much as the film adheres to the strictures of the standard comic-book movie, it also pops with a knowing, loving, Whedon-world jokiness that keeps everything barreling along."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,100,The Avengers is both campy and ­reverential. Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms. I had a blast.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,100,"Most impressive of all, The Avengers makes superhero movies new again - a colossal task indeed."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,91,"Tasked with meeting the many requirements necessary for any Avengers movie to work, Whedon checks off all the boxes, then sets about creating new expectations for what a big superhero movie ought to be."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,90,"The real hero here is Joss Whedon, who directs the film with a fanboy's enthusiasm and a thorough knowledge of the genre."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,88,The Avengers kicks ass.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,88,"The Avengers has it all. And then some. Six superheroes for the price of one ticket... It's also the blockbuster I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one, shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ""Transformers"" with a brain, a heart and working sense of humor. Suck on that, Michael Bay. [10 May 2012, p.74]"
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,83,"The Avengers is as brawny and lamebrainy as any comic book movie deserves to be, capped by a 40-minute assault pummeling senses as few action sequences ever have."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,83,"In terms of storytelling, The Avengers is for the most part a highly functional, banged-together vehicle that runs on synthetic franchise fuel. Yet the grand finale of CGI action, set in the streets of New York, is - in every sense - smashing."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"This mania is what Marvel followers have hungered for, and it would be fruitless to deny their delight. As Loki says to a crowd of earthlings, ""It is the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation."" We do, Master, we do."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Whedon is the key reason why this $220-million behemoth of a movie is smartly thought out and executed with verve and precision. It may be overly long at two hours, 23 minutes, but so much is going on you might not even notice."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,The action scenes-blissfully easy to follow-are where Whedon makes the giant leap into the big leagues.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"The Avengers doesn't aim for transcendence, only for the juggler's skill of keeping the balls smoothly airborne, and in 3-D too (converted after production). At that it succeeds."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"The Avengers have been assembled and, for the most part, they fit together superbly. A joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Big, brash and very funny, Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble is equal to the sum of its parts – and for once, that's no faint praise. Suit up."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,80,"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,78,"Fans of all that has come before (excluding Roger Corman's premature-ejaculation version of ""The Fantastic Four,"" natch) will weep tears of giddy joy at how crowd-pleasingly cohesive – and ridiculously fun – this film is."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"The banter has zip, the effects are fun, the climactic battle is decently spectacular, and if the 3-D is mostly expendable, there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"Even with the flaws of the final half, The Avengers is grand, brisk fun.  It comes tantalizingly close to reaching the level of the very best comic book films of the current generation."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,The film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"The Avengers has been executed with all the reverence the super-fans demand, as well as the winking, self-referential humor that has made it palatable for filmgoers disinclined to take a bunch of grown men dressed in spangles and spandex so very seriously."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,Whedon has made a superb template of an action film.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"Whedon weaves a story that allows each of the heroes to do what they do best. And while they may not have exactly equal time, audiences get enough of each to feel satisfied, but not sated. Clever work, indeed."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"When I see these six together, I can't help thinking of the champions at the Westminster Dog Show. You have breeds that seem completely different from one another (Labradors, poodles, boxers, Dalmatians), and yet they're all champions."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"You don't need to be a ""comic-book person"" to find the set pieces exhilarating. But if you are such a person, or a fan of the movies that comic books turn into, The Avengers feels like the moment you've been waiting for."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"If the film is more solid and satisfying than terrific, so be it."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,75,"The Avengers is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. What it expertly is, is whelming."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,70,"Because it pulls off the tricky feat of combining multiple pre-existing Marvel franchises into a reasonably entertaining and tonally coherent whole, The Avengers will likely be hailed as a kind of thinking fan's superhero film, the way Whedon's recent ""Cabin in the Woods"" functioned as both a horror movie and a critique of same."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,63,"The fiery finale is good enough to leave the legions smiling. But when a movie is expected to lift an entire industry, ""good enough"" shouldn't be good enough."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,63,"The chaos and carnage here is just a pumped-up take on a tradition that harks back to Godzilla, and harks back, of course, to the Marvel comics from which all these heros originally sprang."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,63,"While The Avengers exhibits exemplary craftsmanship, Joss Whedon hasn't made a great film."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,"They're fascinating characters, to be sure, with back stories ripe for development. But Whedon doesn't commit here, and the results are shrug-worthy."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,The picture is broken down into narrative chunks that ultimately don't tell much of a story – what you get instead is a series of mini-climaxes held together by banter between characters.
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,"It's fun to watch Whedon pitch his heroes against each other. Child's play, maybe, but entertaining all the same."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,60,"The bad news is that if you haven't seen ""Thor,"" ""Captain America"" and ""Iron Man 2"" - that's six hours and three minutes of homework - The Avengers won't make sense. The good news is if you're a human under the age of 45, you probably already have."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,50,"Expected too is the result: a kind of sterile opulence or, if you prefer, a magnificent emptiness."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,50,"Every time the movie hints at something rich and evocative, Whedon undercuts it with a punchline - his instincts as a big-picture storyteller crippled by his short-term need to please the crowd."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,50,"The Avengers has a knockout final 30 minutes, all gee-whiz crash and bang and eye candy that makes grand use of 3D and IMAX and all the other toys. But the Transformers movies did that, too."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,40,"A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-""Transformers"" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,40,"The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,40,"What I see in The Avengers, unfortunately, is a diminished film despite its huge scale, and kind of a bore."
The Avengers,8.1,623357910,30,"Of the star-studded cast, only Mark Ruffalo (playing Bruce Banner) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man) bring any personality to the place-holder dialogue. Overlong, monotonous, violent, and simple-minded, this is like one of those ""World's Biggest Gang Bang"" videos, except that no one onscreen appears to be enjoying himself."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"A great movie... A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"Because it is a sequel, it's less satisfying than the more idea-driven original, but this is still top-flight kick-ass entertainment"
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"Cameron's achievement isn't only technical. He's using all the not-so-cheap thrills of a violent genre to make a movie with an antiviolence message, and the wonder of T2 is that he pulls it off without looking silly."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,100,"The key element in any action picture, I think, is a good villain. Terminator 2 has one, along with an intriguing hero and fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played by Furlong with guts and energy."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,90,"T2 features bigger, bolder, more energetic action sequences than its predecessor."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,88,The movie is a great big feast of wreckage. But that’s also what makes it a bit numbing.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,88,"As with ""Aliens,"" director James Cameron has again taken a first rate science fiction film and crafted a sequel that's in some ways more impressive - expanding on the original rather than merely remaking it."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,83,"Visceral to the point of overkill (and beyond), a berserk blizzard of kinetic images, it doesn't even give you time to be scared."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,80,"The action in Terminator 2 is edited for maximum suspense, and much of it is mounted on such a grand scale that little in movie history comes close. (Scenes in last summer's Die Hard 2 did, but they lacked the finesse of the new film)."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,80,"The film's relentless pummeling grows wearying at 135 minutes. The first Terminator, a half-hour shorter, was leaner and meaner."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,80,It's a joyride until you think about the film's biggest contradiction. How come this movie celebrating the superiority of human feelings over machine precision is most alive when thrilling in the mechanical perfection of the Terminator and T-1000? Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart. But its soul is that of a killer machine.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,Trend-setting visuals compensate for a plot that lacks the imagination and edge of the 1984 original.
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,"Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first film's potent but rudimentary visual style. He has also broadened his initial idea to encompass better developed characters (after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal), a livelier wit and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,"What is notable, though, is the amount of compassion invested in the film by Cameron and co-screenwriter William Wisher. There's a fairly well-drawn moral message in T2 that was more or less absent in the first film."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,75,"All the virtues of the original... are present here, though when Cameron tries to milk some sentiment out of the ""personality"" and fate of his top machine he comes up flat and empty, and the other characters are scarcely more interesting."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,8.5,204843350,70,"If you change the course of history, the world will experience a different kind of chaos. That's a time-honored movie cliche. Terminator 2: Judgment Day chooses to go against that philosophy, noisily and with some monotony."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,88,"You need to see this one on the biggest screen possible, and let it wash over you as if you had stepped inside the most incredible video game experience ever created — one in which events in the manufactured universe can have lasting and serious real-world consequences."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,83,"It runs too long and drags a bunch in its final third, but make no mistake: This is Spielberg’s biggest crowdpleaser in years, a CGI ride that wields the technology with an eye for payoff."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,81,"The sheer dynamism and energy of the movie are compelling, even when the character drama isn’t."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"Its plot is complexity itself, but its ""kids save the world"" soul is simple and earnest as opposed to earth shattering. With apologies to Bill and Ted, it's an excellent adventure, and let's leave it at that."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,The movie is crammed with excitement and good humor.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"Spielberg has seemingly done the impossible: balancing sugar-rush nostalgia with an involving story to create a pure, uncynical, cinematic ride that recaptures the magic of his early films."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,80,"A rollicking adventure through worlds both bleak and fantastic, Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One makes big changes to the specifics and structure of Ernest Cline's best-selling novel but keeps the spirit and level-up thrills intact."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,76,"I don’t know how he does it, or for that matter why, but Spielberg turns Ready Player One into something that’s both nostalgic and new, something impersonal yet uniquely his. It is not one of his better movies; it’s probably not even in the top half. It’s way too long and packed with too much extra junk. It is still, somehow, a gas."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Although Ready Player One is nowhere near as memorable as “Jaws” or “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” it demonstrates that the director is fully capable of adapting to the times. What the film lacks in substance, it makes up for in style."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"My main beef is with Spielberg’s choice to leave out his own work, both as producer and director: “I didn’t corner the ’80s market,” he told Entertainment Weekly. But yeah, he kind of did."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"A loving ode to a few decades that Spielberg made his own, Ready Player One’s an entertaining nostalgia trip that wears its influences proudly but throws them at such dizzying force that sometimes you feel like you’re buried under Chuck E. Cheese tokens."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Never mind the director’s still-prodigious work ethic, the big-screen adaptation of Ernest Cline’s giddily overstuffed, ’80s-saturated best-seller is, in a way, a movie that couldn’t be more bespoke to Spielberg. After all, so many of that decade’s most indelible touchstones poured directly from his brain. It’s the perfect marriage of fabulist and fable."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"It’s good to see Spielberg, at 71, still finding new forms of cinematic language with which to express his humanism. It also should be said that though Ready Player One wears a cheerful face, there are none of the usual heartwarming, classic Spielberg moments. That’s because, second to “Munich,” this is his most pessimistic film."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Spielberg has invested massive creative capital into Ready Player One and the resulting production has all the ingredients viewers expect from potential blockbusters. Whether it achieves the level experienced by Spielberg’s biggest successes remains to be seen, but it is without a question one of the year’s most energetic, visually rewarding, and ultimately exhausting motion pictures."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,Spielberg's visual inventiveness is unflagging.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, a rollicking virtual-world geekfest flooded by ’80s ephemera, doesn’t just want to wade back into the past. It wants to race into it at full throttle. For those who get their fix through pop nostalgia, “Ready Player One” is — for better or worse — an indulgent, dizzying overdose."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Spielberg’s control of pacing, rhythm, action dynamics and tonal juggling is so astute that the story of Wade never quite gets lost in all the fly-by jokes and references. Sheridan’s highly skillful, as is Cooke."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Ready Player One, based on the bestseller of the same name, is a pandering, crassly commercial victory of intellectual property law that’s also, in its best moments, a grand popcorn entertainment, made with skill and wit and even sincerity."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Dazzling in form and a chase film at its heart, Ready Player One is exhilarating, but it also can’t sit still. Fitting to the content perhaps, the movie still arguably suffers from troublesome A.D.D. with its hyper fast cutting and its tendency to wander narratively."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,75,"Everything in Ready Player One ties together into an action-packed, upbeat, hero’s journey that keeps the film moving along at a thrilling pace. While it’s not particularly emotional and I was disappointed by how many questions are left open by its shallow visits to the real world, it’s still a lot of fun."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"Ambitious, sweet-spirited."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"There’s not much wrong with the movie on its own terms. But there’s nothing great about it, either. It doesn’t have the breathless exuberance, the highs, of Spielberg’s best “escapist” work, maybe because everything is so filtered, so arm’s length."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,"Visually, the movie is amazing — jaw-droppingly so. This is as technologically impressive as anything Spielberg has done, if not more so. The story, on the other hand, based on the bestselling novel by Ernest Cline, doesn’t just allow for narrative shortcuts; it practically demands them."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,70,It’s an accomplished and intermittently hypnotic movie. Yet you may feel like you’re occupied more than you are invested.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,67,"Spielberg wants us to drop the techno-gadgets and join hands, but it’s the VR world that really juices him. He’s the ultimate fanboy making a movie about the need to move beyond being a fan."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,67,"And yet, for all those weaknesses, this is a Steven Spielberg film, of the kind only Steven Spielberg can make. Big, raucous, heartfelt, referential, and unabashed in celebrating the culture he has always loved."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,65,"Rather than dig into the mind-boggling, byzantine inner workings of the OASIS, Spielberg spends time with the flashier stuff. He is, even in this later, moodier phase of his career, still an entertainer first and foremost."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"It overuses ’80s nostalgia as shorthand for genuine emotional involvement, and it presents us with a rapturous digital wonderworld only to sternly lecture us that reality is the better value."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One is competent, occasionally rousing entertainment that nonetheless left me a little bummed."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"Ready Player One is at once familiar in its fabric and forward thinking in its technology, with a combination of gritty live action and glossy CGI. It’s an ambitious mix that can be thrilling while it lasts, and yet it fails to linger for long afterward, leaving you wondering what its point is beyond validating the insularity of ravenous fandom."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"If Ready Player One is tedious at times, it’s also oodles of fun at others."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"I didn’t dislike “Player One,” even if I rolled my eyes at the low-hanging fruit one-liners and cloying characters, the on-the-nose soundtrack tunes (Van Halen?), the cringe-worthy avatars from your favorite horror movies, all introduced to the giggles and applause of an audience sure it’s in on the joke. Because the movie was concocted to elicit just that reaction."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,63,"It's a boldly attempted strike against the monolithic corporatization of fan service, and arguably one of the few films that defines dystopia as nothing less than a marketplace of trademarked, cross-promotional intellectual property. In other words, our here and now."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"I saw the film in IMAX, and a week later I’m still waiting for the safe return of my optic nerves, but it was the meagre emotional charge that shocked me most. Toward the end, as in many Spielberg movies, there are tears, but, for once, they feel unearned."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future. But it seems to have no idea how dystopian it really is.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It misses the point to ask, as some have recently, whether he’s still able to have fun at the age and status he has attained. Sure he is. He must have had great fun making this immense Tinker Toy of a movie, but there’s a fundamental mismatch between artist and material."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It’s a film in which Spielberg’s traditional reverence for the wonder and idealism of youth has had to compromise with wised-up survivalist toughness of the new YA mode. But what extraordinary visuals this films conjures up, with images that appear and disappear like quicksilver memes."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Ready Player One is entertaining enough, and it’s certainly well-made, but what truly stands out is the filmmaker’s prevailing-present sense of bemused disgust at the way his offspring are spending their time. He can’t go home again, and he knows it."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Mr. Spielberg, a digital enthusiast and an old-school cineaste, goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Spielberg asks audiences to fondly remember their childhood, and to fall back in love with characters, songs and stories long forgotten. At the same time, there is a didactic notion that reality is always better than a synthetic replication. You can’t comfortably have both."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"It’s a CGI-heavy fantasia that will pop your eyeballs, but giddy as it is, it never quite sells its characters or gets much purchase on your emotions."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,"Once the initial thrill wears off, it’s a hollow kind of fun, which is almost certainly the point."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,60,Ready Player One isn’t slick enough a commentary worth getting riled up about or distracting enough to hide glaring structural issues underneath a barrage of “HEY I KNOW THEM!” cameos like dangling keys in front of a dog.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,58,"It’s a theme park ride but not the rollercoaster Spielberg hopes. More like It’s a Small Virtual World, careening through gamer nirvana, jerking viewers to and fro among everything Gen X retro."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,58,"In spite of how visually dazzling and legitimately entertaining it is, Ready Player One is at its heart, a celebration of the gormless rube. It is a paean to the schmuck. To celebrate it uncritically is to become one."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"So much of Ready Player One is assembled from the detritus of our past that it is less a film and more an overstuffed cultural recycling bin. A shiny, expensive, well-cast and professionally assembled recycling bin, sure, but a trash heap all the same."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"The scenes of millions of things happening at once are skillfully made, to be sure, but they’re still visually busy to the point of numbness instead of energization. The action has verve but no soul."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"Ready Player One has no obligation to be a rigorous intellectual exercise, even if it amounts to a wasted opportunity to explore who else might steer tech, and society, toward greater equity. But it doesn’t have to be so facile, either. Maybe next time the screenwriters shouldn’t set the difficulty mode to “easy.”"
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,The emphasis here is on the splashy spectacle with those insider-knowledge elements jammed together in a frenetic hodgepodge.
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"This film, mostly shot in the UK, is technically suberb. But splitting the pleasures of virtual and reality, Ready Player One never fully satisfies on either front."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,50,"Because Spielberg seems as eager as Wade to get back to the digital fantasy world he’s created, a lot of the human element is elided or glossed over."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,45,"Overall, the movie left me feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,42,"The joy of Ready Player One does indeed come from its world-building and kaleidoscopic mashup of pop culture—what Spielberg would likely dub its “movie” elements.... At a certain point, though, Ready Player One wants to be appreciated as a film as well as a movie, no matter what Spielberg says. And that’s where it begins to falter."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,40,"Those who come away cheering for Ready Player One will likely have enjoyed the film’s many references, the story’s breakneck speed and playful visual design. Others may want to unplug from the paint-by-number characters and shallow plot."
Ready Player One,7.5,137690172,30,"With Steven Spielberg behind the camera, Ernest Cline’s book had potential to transcend its source material. It’s disheartening that the finished product is little more than the cinematic equivalent of a pop culture mashup tee, which takes cherished icons of film and coats them in garish CGI while clumsily smashing them against one another like a child playing with action figures."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,100,"Rogue One might trade heavily in nostalgia but it's bold enough to take risks, and will leave you stirred, fired up and raring for more. Now, if only there was a follow-up we could go away and watch immediately…"
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,100,"It stands alone as the best ""Star Wars"" entry since 1980's ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Yes, it's that good."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,90,"Perhaps the darkest, most action-packed Star Wars instalment, director Gareth Edwards’ standalone adventure establishes its own rhythm, balancing fan demands with grand, poetic moments unlike anything this cinematic galaxy has previously achieved."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,Rogue One spins “Star Wars” into a whole new orbit.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,"Rogue One is a letdown in other areas, and there are creative decisions so ill-conceived they take you out of the story. But somehow these aren't enough to sink the movie, which manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a ""Star Wars"" film."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,"This is a very “Star Wars”-y “Star Wars” movie. It’s not quite on the level of the original or “The Empire Strikes Back” (the best of ’em all, of course), but it’s on a par with last year’s “The Force Awakens” and it’s light years above “Attack of the Clones” and “The Phantom Menace.”"
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,88,"With the smashing Jones giving us a female warrior to rank with the great ones and a cast that knows how to keep it real even in a sci-fi fantasy, Rogue One proves itself a Star Wars story worth telling."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,83,Rogue One would have been a very good stand-alone sci-fi movie if it came out under a different name. But what makes it especially exciting is how it perfectly snaps right into the Star Wars timeline and connects events we already know by heart with ones that we never even considered.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,83,"Rogue One is a very good “Star Wars” film, frustratingly though, it falls short of being a truly great one."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"The film soars when it abandons all pretense of being a space opera, and fully embraces the bombastic modern action movie that’s at its core, giving it a unique identity that does indeed stand apart from other entries in the series."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"A minor miracle in and of itself, Edwards' Rogue One somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting The Force Awakens for sheer spectacle and world-building."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"This is an imperfect film, bold but occasionally baffling, and one that in its final act grows into something much more exciting than you might initially expect."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"Rogue One stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the “Star Wars” franchise (obviously) but also separate – a tougher, grittier film."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"The ultimate Star Wars fan film, it’s short on whimsy but when it gets going there’s enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"What fans will get here is loads of action, great effects, good comic relief, stunning locations (Iceland, Jordan and the Maldives) and some intriguing early glimpses of the Galactic Empire as it begins to flex its inter-galactic power."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,"But in its best moments, there’s a yarn-spinning intimacy to it too – an old war story told around a spectacular campfire."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,80,This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,78,"It starts off slow and somewhat clunky, but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives, it’s all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,Rogue One is a better movie than The Force Awakens - something that elevates it considerably over its “secondary” designation.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"By the time its credits rolled, I was ready to forgive Rogue One any imperfections. Its last 10 minutes are spectacular and dark, with a final flourish that should give any “Star Wars” fan goose bumps — and a new hope that the next main installment will be this good."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"It has undeniable weaknesses: an underwritten protagonist, a generic villain, a shortage of interesting personalities. (No knock against the large cast, which is mostly very good, but underused.) But in many other respects, it is a better film than last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens: leaner, darker, with a distinct visual style and an actual ending that feels like a denial of blockbuster expectations simply because it shows basic narrative integrity."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the “Star Wars” rebellion are high indeed."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,Rogue One will engage such diehards but making new friends for the brand is unlikely.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"I do wish Felicity Jones’ character popped the way Daisy Ridley’s did in last year’s franchise offering. “The Force Awakens,” directed by J.J. Abrams, was smooth, consistent, even-toned, nostalgic. Rogue One zigzags, and it’s more willfully jarring. Yet it takes time for callbacks and shout-outs to characters we’ve seen before, and we’ll see again. And again. And again."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,75,"It’s almost wholly satisfying — witty, warm and entertaining — a film in which fatalism isn’t a joke, where pitiless death is doled out by Empire and Rebellion, where those deaths have weight and meaning, where suspense is genuine."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,"The movie didn’t rekindle the thrill of seeing, say, The Empire Strikes Back, but Rogue One will loom pretty large in the Star Wars galaxy — if only because there’s so little competition."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,"By breaking some of the rules, Rogue One has made itself the first movie since The Empire Strikes Back to redefine the boundaries of what a Star Wars movie can be. The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it’s Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,"A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of “A New Hope,” manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,Director Gareth Edwards has finally made the first “Star Wars” movie for grown-ups.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,70,Rogue One makes up for a shaky first act by punching into overdrive for an outstanding third act battle sequence that overwhelms in scale and intensity.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,65,"With all the aerial dogfights, armored combat vehicles, grenades, flame-throwers and snipers, Rogue One feels like a film for those who think that most Star Wars movies are insufficiently like World War II flicks. Or maybe that they should more closely resemble computer games."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,"The cast does good work, despite a less-than-great screenplay."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,"By no stretch is this a disaster on a par with Lucas’s misbegotten prequel trilogy. Still, at least until its final section, Rogue One lacks the zip, zing and exhilarating sense of return to form that “The Force Awakens” conveyed so lightly."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,"Rogue One is often undermined by its close ties to George Lucas’ original trilogy, and more emphasis is put on its central mission than its fresh-faced characters."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,63,Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,60,"Edwards is very good at crafting images that straddle the uncomfortable line between beauty and horror, and at dwarfing people with giant monsters and machines with powers beyond mortal comprehension. It’s his comprehension of mortals that sometimes feels lacking."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,58,"Action is Rogue One’s strongest suit, and what makes all the faffing about bearable."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,58,"For a film that’s all about hope and rebellion, it’s kind of ironic how it’s such a conflicted mess in and of itself. The Force should have been stronger with this one."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,58,"Not only is “Rogue One” the rare modern blockbuster that could have afforded to risk something real, it’s the rare modern blockbuster that gave itself a genuine responsibility to do so. And yet, for all of its excitement and occasional splendor, there’s nothing the least bit rebellious about it. It could have been special, instead it’s just… forced."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"The story hits every expected beat, right when you expect it to. And it squanders some of its best resources."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Plots and subplots are handled with clumsy expediency, and themes that might connect this movie with the larger Lucasfilm mythos aren’t allowed to develop. You’re left wanting both more and less."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,Rogue One is a minor little story with a likable cast and familiar Star Wars themes. But it tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece – with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score –  that it ends up a laughable parody of itself.
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Only Tudyk’s dry humour in the role of the tactless droid K-2S0 makes Edwards’s darkly reductivist approach occasionally seem smarter rather than lesser. In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Rogue One's creators clearly want to move us deeply — several major plot developments should pack an overwhelming emotional wallop — but they haven’t given this talented cast enough to work with. It’s fast, loud, even lovely — and not terribly engaging."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"The good news about Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the first in a planned series of stand-alone movies set in the “Star Wars” universe, is that the last half-hour of the film is a sustained stretch of rousing action, indelible images and cliffhanger thrills. It’s pop sci-fi bliss...The bad news about Rogue One is that getting to the good stuff is a slog — and the movie is pretty long."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,50,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is for the fans, all right, but in that expression’s worst way."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,42,"Edwards and the screenwriters have designed Rogue One around applause breaks for cameos and callbacks. We’ve all lost the point of the franchise. Audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future; now, it’s to soak in the past."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,40,"The fault lies not with Ms. Jones, an appealing performer, but with Gareth Edwards, who directed doggedly from a delight-free script by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,38,"“Star Wars” movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don’t think “dull” was the most appropriate adjective."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,30,"The director of Rogue One, Gareth Edwards, has stepped into a mythopoetic stew so half-baked and overcooked, a morass of pre-instantly overanalyzed implications of such shuddering impact to the series’ fundamentalists, that he lumbers through, seemingly stunned or constrained or cautious to the vanishing point of passivity, and lets neither the characters nor the formidable cast of actors nor even the special effects, of which he has previously proved himself to be a master, come anywhere close to life."
Rogue One,7.8,532177324,25,"It’s a downer. It’s morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino’s music can’t make it better."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,80,"The achievement of John Carter is that it takes the elements worn to nubs by everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Avatar"" to TV's ""Fringe"" and makes them fresh again."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,78,"Old-school ""Gosh, wow!"" sense-of-wonder filmmaking is in short supply in these anxious days, and John Carter (of Mars!) left me with my disbelief in suspended animation and once or twice with goosebumps dotting my arms. And that's enough for me."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,Did anybody expect it to be a metaphor for modern America?
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,The result is an entertaining diversion but it lacks the magnificence one desires in the opening chapter of a would-be franchise.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,John Carter is too wickedly strange not to recommend. Movies this expensive usually play it much safer.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"Against the odds, John Carter is itself pretty amazing - an epic pulp saga that slowly rises to the level of its best imitations and wins you over by degrees."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"Spirit counts for something too, and John Carter has plenty of that, in addition to the requisite dashes of wit."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"John Carter manages to be a ridiculous amount of fun, even if you are immune to the charms of Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) running around in what amounts to a stylish loincloth."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,75,"Rather than trying to overwhelm viewers by overloading the senses, John Carter's effects strive to create something new using as their foundation a book that's fired imaginations for the past century."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,70,"This middle section, in which both Carter and the audience get a crash course in the politics, history, and theology of the Red Planet, is the movie at its most imaginative and most fun."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,70,"If you're willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence, it's also a rip-roaring, fun adventure, fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,70,Director Andrew Stanton's Disney extravaganza is a rather charming pastiche.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,65,"It’s tempting to believe a great sci-fi yarn exists in Carter, somewhere in the no doubt thick sheaf of studio notes demanding more spoon-feeding of an audience they believe to be equally thick. But more likely, it’s possible that Stanton simply wasn’t ready to make the leap from animation to super-budgeted live action."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,63,"That's kind of the aesthetic that Stanton is going for: over-the-top pulp. But there's something generic about the digitally rendered Martians, and there's a corniness to the dialogue that keeps the audience from any kind of emotional attachment to the Tharks and Zodangans and their ilk."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,63,"John Carter bites off more than even Woola can chew, but it's built on something rare: wonder instead of Hollywood cynicism."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,63,"Does John Carter get the job done for the weekend action audience? Yes, I suppose it does. The massive city on legs that stomps across the landscape is well-done. The Tharks are ingenious, although I'm not sure why they need tusks. Lynn Collins makes a terrific heroine."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"Get your ass to Mars? A handsome new sci-fi adventure that feels rather familiar. Enjoyable enough while it lasts, John Carter is big on ambition and disappointingly short on action."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"There's no wonder or elation or even dopy sincerity here - just a high level of proficiency and, yes, a lot of expensive CGI."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,There are plenty of entertaining moments to latch onto beneath the sci-fi tropes -- and maybe even a few that will inspire a new generation of storytellers.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"It is a potpourri of arcane and familiar genres. ""Mash-up"" doesn't begin to capture this hectic hybrid; it's more like a paintball fight. Messy and chaotic, in other words, but also colorful and kind of fun."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"What director Andrew Stanton has brought forth from Burroughs' limited, hoary source material is actually kind of fun."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,60,"Stanton has built a fantastic world, but the action is unmemorable. Still, just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,58,So why is everything so thuddingly fun-free?
John Carter,6.6,73078100,55,"When Stanton lets the film be pure popcorn entertainment, with swashbuckling set pieces and lovably corny romanticism, it's a great ride in the Indiana Jones tradition."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"Epically fantastic would be a welcome change, although epically awful would at least keep the symmetry. Alas, epically bland will have to do."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"Though the project, based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel ""A Princess of Mars,"" is ambitious, it's also bloated, dreary and humorless."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"Unlike Stanton's memorable animation features, this is surprisingly devoid of humor or winning characterization, though the special effects are fantastic."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"The result is that John Carter plays like an alternate, inferior version of ""Avatar""…Plus fleeting hints of John Ford's ""The Searchers"" - for this is also a Western."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"John Carter isn't much - or rather, it's too much and not enough in weird, clumpy combinations - but it is a curious sort of blur."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"It's all too much, and it's too hard to follow. Less is more, and this movie proves it."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,50,"The film's biggest (and saddest) crime is malaise - it's not that John Carter doesn't care about what it's doing, it just can't make us care, even though the magnitude of every event, conflict and emotion is as melodramatic as its Victorian roots."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"This new Disney film, marked by myriad lapses and marketing follies, bears the woefully familiar earmarks of a big studio production that was pulled and hauled every which way until it lost all shape and flavor."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"That John Carter is so hit and miss, and miss, and miss is unfortunate on any number of levels."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"Aside from a few inspired vistas and alien life-forms (the Road Runner–fast red planet dog Woola is sure to sell a bazillion action figures), John Carter is as deadly dull as its basso-voiced, beefcake slab of a star, Taylor Kitsch."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"Stanton has been given the resources to create an expansive, expensive world, but lacks the instincts to direct live-action, a limitation that shows most in the performances. Bare of chest and fair of feature, Kitsch doesn't exhibit enough charisma to carry a project of this scale."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,40,"Interminably long, dull and incomprehensible, John Carter evokes pretty much every sci-fi classic from the past 50 years without having any real personality of its own."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,Even Strong's best efforts can't save John Carter from collapsing in on itself like a dead star.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,"The opening to John Carter is a dud, a battle between airships made of woven bamboo, bursting into computer-generated flame over a sandy terrain. There's nothing to see, nothing to think about, nothing to care about, and nothing to feel, just emptiness. The emptiness is never filled over the course of 132 long, barren minutes."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,"Nothing in John Carter really works, since everything in the movie has been done so many times before, and so much better."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,25,"Dejah, with her seen-it-all-before smirk, is not a very sympathetic heroine, and Kitsch is stolid and dull. And as for the red planet, the answer to David Bowie's famous question is no. What a sadd'ning bore it is."
John Carter,6.6,73078100,20,Most annoying is John Carter's scarcity of action. This much buck should buy more bang.
John Carter,6.6,73078100,16,"As film theorist Siegfried Kracauer once wrote, to paraphrase, art often blooms in the most hostile soil. No such luck here."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,Director James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd (both of whom co-wrote the script) demonstrate their storytelling virtuosity.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,"A blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,"Getting the extraordinary physical specimen of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead was a stroke of genius and a stroke of fortune. Each of his pecs is the size of a bull’s flank. It is a tremendous black-comic performance and, without Schwarzenegger, the movie is of course unthinkable."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,"From the slam-bang direction to the relentless pace to the not-a-word-wasted dialogue and even the driving synth score, everything else about The Terminator just works."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,100,The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind since The Road Warrior.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,91,It's a rousing science fiction story that proves an on-screen adrenaline rush.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,An amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget.
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,"When Terminator is not taking itself seriously -- and sometimes even when it is -- it's lots of fun. And filmmakers James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd don't drown us in blood, though it's not for the squeamish."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,"An efficient, cold-blooded sci-fi splatter movie that never makes the mistake of forgetting that on some level it is deeply ridiculous."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,90,"Those nightmares we’ve all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,88,"It's rather confusing. But in the context of this wildly imaginative movie, it's all, rather exciting, too."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,88,"Schwarzenegger is presented as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength--the image is more geological than human--and Cameron plays his crushing weightiness against the strangely light, almost graceful violence of the gunplay directed against him. The results have the air of a demented ballet."
The Terminator,8.0,38400000,80,A B-movie with flair.
Logan,8.1,226277068,100,"The R-rating does represent truth in advertising, and it has conferred a kind of liberation on what strikes me, a violence-averse moviegoer at heart, as the best superhero film to come out of the comic-book world, and I’m not forgetting Tim Burton’s “Batman” or Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight.”"
Logan,8.1,226277068,100,"Logan takes its indestructible metal claws to comic book movie norms and destroys them, and it’s a wonderful thing."
Logan,8.1,226277068,100,"This is a filmmaker’s film, a fully realized statement that oozes with the assurance and confidence of a hungry visionary who not only knows what he wants to do but how to do it."
Logan,8.1,226277068,91,Logan is the rare action flick in which the quiet moments are as compelling as any of the fights.
Logan,8.1,226277068,91,"What’s special about Logan is that it manages to deliver the visceral goods, all the hardcore Wolverine action its fans could desire, while still functioning as a surprisingly thoughtful, even poignant drama—a terrific movie, no “comic-book” qualifier required."
Logan,8.1,226277068,91,"James Mangold's Logan is an uncommonly mature comic book movie, practically from another universe unto itself. It's a movie demanding and deserving to be taken seriously, an elegy for a mutant."
Logan,8.1,226277068,90,It’s not just one of the best superhero movies ever – it’s a damn-fine cinematic representation of the human condition in all its agonizing forms.
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"Logan isn’t the typical superhero flick. It’s more like a Western, with Jackman turning in a performance that’s reminiscent of Clint Eastwood in his Man With No Name days."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"More than any other comic book character outside of Nolan’s Batman, Wolverine has evolved. With his glimpse into what superhero movies can be, James Mangold has given us something sadly lacking in recent genre entries: hope."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"If Jackman and Stewart are serious about this being their mutual X-Men swan song, they could not have crafted a more heartfelt valedictory."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"For all its moodiness and melancholy, Logan is also a rip-roaring action film — and it’s wickedly funny at times as well."
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,It’s a captivating throwback that promises to lead the genre away from sci-fi flash and trickery. I’d rank it beside “X-Men: Days of Future Past” among the best X-Men entries.
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,Logan is the rare blockbuster that could be a game-changer. It will certainly change the way we look at other superhero movies and how history judges the entire MCU and DC Universe of films.
Logan,8.1,226277068,88,"Easily the best Wolverine outing, Logan is The Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important — and for Logan, that means coming to grips with needing loved ones in his life."
Logan,8.1,226277068,83,A rather brilliant mesh of dystopian and superhero tropes that proves to be as entertaining as it is timely.
Logan,8.1,226277068,81,"The weight of graphic, grotesque violence hangs over the entire movie. But the daring emotional violence lingers longer, well after the lights go down on the final shot."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"The film is stunningly bleak and staggeringly violent. Major characters go down in showers of blood and gore. I’ve seen worse and so, probably, have you, but never from such an essentially wholesome corporate enterprise with a target audience so young and hopeful."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Logan is a strong argument for bringing the comic-book movie down to earth. It solidly hits its marks as it moves the franchise furniture around, and features striking special-effects scenes in which the world shudders to a near standstill."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Logan is a serious take on the comic-book genre, the Marvel Cinematic Universe in particular, and it’s a good one. Not a great one, though, which it might've been if it hadn’t gotten in its own way, overdoing it with its R-rated freedoms."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"A stand-alone adventure, it’s also a salute to a series, a character and a quietly committed actor."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"It is not a superhero flick as we have come to know the genre but a road movie and a Western, one that plays with the myth of the aging cowboy."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"It's R-rated because it has grown-up things to say -- things about mortality, aging, guilt, regret, and about what happens when superheroes, tired of being superheroes, start thinking very dark, very human thoughts."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"In Logan, we have an example of a superhero story taken to new extremes and a franchise to a spare, sad, apocalyptic finish (or “finish”), with R-rated action scenes that are both rousing and unbearably violent."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Amongst the swearing, past gripes and resentments exhibited by wearying central players there is humour, compassion and a great deal more heart and soul than we have come to expect from the rote, by-the-numbers dialogue of Marvels past."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"When it comes to playing a properly magnetic anti-hero with a gruff ’70s-cinema exterior and a dark reservoir of inner depth, Jackman really is the best at what he does."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"This is a fine, fitting finale for the movies’ greatest mutant."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"The heart of the movie is the unexpectedly poignant relationship between Xavier and Logan: I’d be tempted to call them the Steptoe and Son of the mutant world, although in fact Logan goes into Basil Fawlty mode at one stage with his own pickup truck, attempting to trash it – perhaps to teach it a lesson. Logan is a forthright, muscular movie which preserves the X-Men’s strange, exotic idealism."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Overall, Logan is something rather special: a moving and mournful story of life at the end of the line, and the perfect blockbuster for these embittered times."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Logan is a film for people, like me, who thought the only good bit of X-Men: Apocalypse was Michael Fassbender crying in the woods, and left the cinema wishing that had been the whole thing. It’s something no-one could have expected: a creatively risky superhero movie. And it deserves to pay off."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Each time the violence explodes, it’s slashingly satisfying, because it’s earned, and also because Mangold knows just how to stage it."
Logan,8.1,226277068,80,"Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology, James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down stand-alone feature, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman’s nuanced turn as a reluctant, all but dissipated hero."
Logan,8.1,226277068,78,"As light on his feet as he is as a musical-comedy showman, Jackman is perversely even more pleasurable when he’s popping neck veins from the effort of heavy drama."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Mangold mostly lets Logan stand as a showcase for Jackman, that rare performer who can take an already-iconic figure and own him completely, to the point where it’s hard to divorce the two."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"It has, simultaneously, the exhilarating feel of a departure and the finality of a full stop."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Jackman and Stewart’s fond, easy dynamic helps to balance some very provocative brutality, as the movie pushes Wolverine’s berserk nature to graphic new extremes."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Jackman and Stewart give perhaps the most heartfelt performances that they’re ever brought to an “X-Men” movie. Though the tone of the movie is pervasively downbeat, they’re both going out on a very high note."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Logan is a bloody and noble finale to Jackman’s turn with the sideburns and metal claws. It broods and growls, lashes out and swears, and Jackman is magnificent at every one of those."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"A movie with the bleakest vision of Wolverine yet, but also hands down the best treatment the character has received on the big screen in the fifteen plus years Jackman has inhabited the role."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"Logan isn’t always a satisfying movie, but there’s a very satisfying answer to those questions waiting for viewers at the end of it. Satisfying not only because Mangold resolves things with some brilliantly expressive imagery, or because he endows this story with a no-shits-left-to-give honesty that defies its origins and justifies its spectacular violence and salty vocabulary, but because it proves how iconic Jackman has made this character over the last 17 years."
Logan,8.1,226277068,75,"In Logan, the clawed mutant Wolverine finally gets to slash through the constraints of a kid-friendly PG-13 rating, and the result is bloody, vicious fun. The squeamish will avert their eyes, and young children should not be allowed anywhere near this movie, no matter how many X-Men action figures they own."
Logan,8.1,226277068,70,"While this carnage is defensible in theory, and while the filmmakers have taken pains not to linger on the horrific brutality Logan and his terrible claws inflict, the gruesome situations presented, including more than one beheading, work at cross purposes with the film's more serious intent and reminds us that a scot-free escape from the strictures of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not in the cards."
Logan,8.1,226277068,70,"It’s a mature consideration of the ideas underpinning its comic-book motifs. It’s also easily the best Wolverine movie of the three, and an impressive sendoff for Jackman’s version of the character."
Logan,8.1,226277068,70,Whether or not the “Wolverine” movies have a future — Jackman swears this is his last go-round — Logan is an exceedingly entertaining one.
Logan,8.1,226277068,67,"Set in 2029, Logan is the closest thing to a valedictory the Marvel universe has yet concocted. Depending on how sentimental you are about these things – me, not much – it’s a bittersweet event."
Logan,8.1,226277068,67,"The loner has to learn to put someone else first. It’s both as manipulative and hokey as that sounds, but occasionally it works well enough that you might find yourself getting choked up against your better judgment."
Logan,8.1,226277068,63,It recognizes that the thinly veiled secret of Wolverine’s loner act is that he’s always been a cog of some kind.
Logan,8.1,226277068,50,"Logan is deadly serious, and while its gamer-style killing sprees are meant to be excitingly brutal, I found them numbing and, in the climax, borderline offensive."
Logan,8.1,226277068,50,"When Logan and Laura unleash their furious scythes nothing feels settled or satisfied. The world grinds on, fruitlessly weary and wild."
Logan,8.1,226277068,50,"Boasting a few nifty action sequences and the always-compelling Jackman, Logan self-consciously aspires to retire this iteration of the steel-clawed hero with epic grandeur, and the results are often rousingly bleak. And yet, the risks taken...only make the formulaic redemption story and clichéd emotional underpinnings increasingly frustrating."
Logan,8.1,226277068,40,"The picture is mostly tedious and unpleasant, which is a shame for the sake of the performers. Jackman works hard here, and his performance does away with vanity altogether."
Logan,8.1,226277068,25,Logan is another heinous and sophomoric waste of Hugh Jackman ‘s time and considerable talent and another expensive throwaway aimed at milking money out of people who still read comic books. Color it stupid.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,80,"The actors are what save it. Not only does Johnson build on his subversive  persona of hulking, dim-witted likability,  but he’s joined by Neighbors’ Zac Efron, today’s reigning king of the hazy one-liner."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,70,Baywatch...is for those fans who couldn’t resist the show’s soapy charms. New ones who crave a summer blockbuster comedy might enjoy how much it not only owns its dumbness but hurtles itself all the way back around through a flurry of genitalia jokes and F-bombs to splash unapologetically in an R-rated surf of winking postmodernism.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,67,"Baywatch won’t blow anything out of the water (except for the boat it sets on fire), but it will certainly make a splash."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,60,"It’s the smart-ass nerd’s Baywatch. The movie is okay, though, if you don’t mind manic pacing and icky dick jokes."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,60,"Like its source material, Baywatch is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It’s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"Like the show, it’s about an insanely attractive lifeguard crew whose members really throw themselves into their work. But the product teeters between absurdity and earnestness."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"Baywatch is a running gag in slow motion, a thong-in-cheek TV retread swapping wholesome jiggles for dirty giggles. There are places for such humor but beaches don't have gutters."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"You’ll find laughs, zaniness and plenty of signature slow-motion jiggling, but it’s buried under a burdensome two-hour procedural."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"For the most part, Baywatch resembles a scarce amount of its origin and relies on a none-too-arch humor that misses more than it hits."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,Baywatch should have been a lot more fun.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"The result is a scattershot comedy that only intermittently nails either tone, finally just bogging down in flatly choreographed mayhem in the late going."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"No cliché is left unturned, and Gordon compensates with slick action."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"Honestly, I’ve seen more narratively ambitious Mad Libs."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"After a sharp, satiric opening, though, Baywatch slowly sinks. The scenery is pretty, including the actors, but Johnson and Efron are better at making fun of themselves than landing zingers."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"This Baywatch has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they’re beating a dead seahorse."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,"In terms of body objectification, Baywatch is an equal-opportunity exploiter, but when it comes to comedy, it's a total boys' club."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,50,The trouble is that the movie plays it boringly straight.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,48,Baywatch wastes its attractive cast on tired jokes and nothing.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,42,"In spoofing something so forgettable, they’ve made something even less memorable."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,42,"Its insistence on trying to balance wannabe sincerity and earnest actions with laughs is a tonally misconceived idea. Ultimately more forgettable then deplorable, Baywatch isn’t so much a disastrous spill in the ocean as it is disposable garbage making a mess."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"Thank heaven for Dwayne Johnson, whose foot-wide smile will not be switched off, and who saves the life of the movie. Whether it deserves to be saved is another matter."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"The plot doesn't quite sink Baywatch, but it sure slows it down."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"As with any movie of this sort, there are a few laughs. Johnson is as likable an actor as there is, and it’s to the actors’ credit that they buy in to the stupidity. But there aren’t enough laughs and not nearly enough story."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"Everything about Baywatch the movie is big, brash and bombastic."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,40,"Johnson and Efron possess impressive muscles, but the performers have never done as much heavy lifting as they do here. And to their credit, they succeed to some degree."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"As it giggles away at its campy self, at least you can groan along with it."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"It’s all just a day at the beach, harmlessly fun and instantly forgettable."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"When you make films from junk TV, more often than not you’re going to wind up with a junk movie."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"Baywatch is not nearly as good as this genre’s best entries, like 2012’s “21 Jump Street.” It washes up on the beach like a dead whale."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"The movie is all preening and very few laughs, though Daddario and Efron have a few moments, and Johnson remains a supremely likable slab of movie star."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"If you saw the trailer, you got the best the movie has to offer."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,38,"It’s a goof that isn’t goofy enough, a romp that doesn’t, and a tone-deaf riff on a show that was already a parody, in and of itself."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,"The movie is a minor crime, a meandering misdemeanor that’s neither soft-core nor hardcore but no core, with no consistent style and minimal content."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,Baywatch is surprisingly without sexism or condescension: It’s equal-opportunity stupid.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,"Baywatch’s comedy (credited to six different writers) is second-rate and its action is even worse, with special effects that rank among the absolute worst I’ve seen in a big summer movie in many years."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,30,"The film may pretend it’s more sophisticated than the show that spawned it, but its comedic stylings are alarmingly regressive."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,What little plot there is involves drug-running and is just about as disposable as everything in this paltry excuse for a movie.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,The waterlogged end product is an example of lazy writing and direction with the vague hope that perhaps the involvement of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson will attract viewers.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"If anything, Baywatch is a litmus test for how low Johnson can sink while still winning us over."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"When it comes down to it, Baywatch’s central sin is that it’s just…not funny."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"There’s a severe tonal problem this movie never reconciles. It wants to be a self-aware, R-rated comedy and a straightforward action picture. At any moment, it’s one or the other but never both."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,25,"A summer franchise movie that can’t decide if it wants to be a hard-R bawdy comedy, a d-bag-comes-of-age tale or a fairly unironic reboot of the glossy TV show (which ran from 1989-2001), Baywatch fails at all three, despite the best efforts of the perennially game Johnson and Zac Efron."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"What the director and writers have done is turn something that's considered by many to be dumb-but-fun into an overlong, unfunny film that's just plain dumb."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,Baywatch is a tonal mess of epic proportions.
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"Unfunny, unthrilling and unsexy, this doesn’t even reach the low bar set by the source material."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"Tonally, Baywatch veers all over the place like a drunk on a speedboat, making for one of the most lacklustre comedies of the year so far."
Baywatch,5.6,58060186,20,"By about halfway in, the gags dry up and the story sinks like an overweight tourist who took a dip too early after the all-you-can-eat surf ’n’ turf buffet."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,100,"The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and — this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off — more touching than the first film."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,91,"It’s the rare Marvel sequel that manages to expand on what came before in new and rewarding ways, while also striking its own distinct tone even as some of its narrative devices skew familiar."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,91,"How many times have you read that it’s really hard to duplicate the success of the first film in a sequel? Probably more than you can remember. Well, here’s a newsflash: Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 pulls that feat off with only a little strain and a belly of genuine emotion."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,88,"While Marvel metastasizes as a movie brand, the irreverent Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has become a healthy off-shoot. There’s something loose-limbed and unexpected about this series."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,88,"Pratt is engagingly rascally as Quill, and Saldana brings a sassy charisma to the no-nonsense Gamora. But as might be expected, Baby Groot steals the film."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,88,"Just like the first one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a winning and wonderfully relatable gem of crazy."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,86,"By the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the audience is unlikely to feel they’ve seen anything that different from Vol. 1, but it’s clear that Gunn and company knew exactly what qualities made the first film so enjoyable, and what they needed to do to make sure this particular sequel was worth the wait."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"Its unthwartable tempo of quips, gags, cameos (Sly Stallone!), and loud noises rarely feels grating if only because of how loving it feels toward its characters and soundtrack, and how respectful it is toward the limits of its audience’s appetite for superheroic universe-building."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is the deranged Marvel disco you’d expect from a filmmaker who wants to push the limits of an otherwise rigid and structured system.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"Underneath Vol. 2’s sarcastic exterior, Gunn’s script has a big, bleeding heart, pinpointing the characters’ insecurities and emotional scars."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"The Guardians get a welcome return to the big screen, which despite many positives, fails to match the dizzying heights of the original."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,That sense of gooey euphoria runs through everything that’s good in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,80,"Even when the pixels threaten to overwhelm, Gunn finds refuge in his main characters. There’s plenty to enjoy here."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"If it’s overstuffed in the way of most sequels, well, at least it’s stuffed with good cheer."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"Volume 2 can claim to be bigger and better than its predecessor, although it still suffers from some of the narrative sleight-of-hand issues that kept Guardians of Galaxy from achieving greatness."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"It’s a sci-fi action movie that spoofs the form to strong comic effect, and yet it profits from every good thing about the genre it’s mocking. It tries to have it both ways, and it succeeds."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"To some degree, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a more offbeat film than the original, with better gags, better (and more cartoonish) action, and more visual variety."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,The film at one point offers the finest sustained act of emotional storytelling to grace a Marvel Studios production.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"“Vol. 2” avoids many of the flaws of the first movie, and does several things notably better. It’s fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn’t quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original — but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,Hanging with Quill and his mercenary space misfits is still everything you'd want in a wild summer ride.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,75,"There is wit and there are explosions, and while none of them represent a step above “Guardians of the Galaxy,” neither do they impugn the memory of one of the freshest and most fun of the Marvel movies."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,70,"It’s the classic example of the sequel to a really imaginative original: If the first one didn’t exist, this one would seem revolutionary. But the first one does, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, for all its charms, will live in its shadow."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,70,"The characters and their relationships are strong and the dialogue is sharp, but the whole thing feels like a minor installment in an ongoing series."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,70,"Shot for shot, line and line, it’s an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle. Yet this time you can sense just how hard the series’ wizard of a director, James Gunn (now taking off from a script he wrote solo), is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,"Director and writer Gunn is a dab hand with space opera quippery and most of the set-pieces land bang on target, with collateral emotional damage to boot."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,James Gunn's second spin with Marvel's interplanetary misfits still entertains but this time the fun feels forced. Gone is the original's scrappy underdog spirit and a director operating like it's his only chance to make a movie.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,"It’s smarter than most films, but not as smart as the first one. It’s funnier than most films, but not as funny as the first one. And it still probably belongs in the upper tier of Marvel movies but nowhere near as high up as the first one."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,67,Much of the material gets rehashed with slight variations...and many of the space battles have a redundant quality.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,65,"Thankfully, Vol. 2 does come together in the end with a powerful emotional payoff, but that’s only after it becomes a computer-generated action-fest with the fate of the universe hanging in the balance again."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,63,"The sharp comic timing and devil-may-care breeziness of the original only return intermittently, and the new film’s emphasis is on family feuds and forgiveness. It’s heavy on the feels. There are hugs."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,63,"What flipped by as a funny, big-budget whimsy before takes on gravitas — daddy issues, intimacy issues, trust issues."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,63,This one's a step down from the original.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"Gunn decides to treat the quest for meaning seriously — a lethal move that not only leads to the noisy palaver of the climax but also undermines Chris Pratt, who likes to hold these movies at arm’s length, as it were, and to probe them for pomposity."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"It’s tough being a hitmaker who isn’t weighed down by corporate expectations, but for a while, Mr. Gunn does a pretty good job of keeping the whole thing reasonably fizzy, starting with an opener that winks at the audience with big bangs and slapstick."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 probably couldn’t, and definitely doesn’t, recapture the sweet and singular silliness of the original, though the new edition from Marvel Studios and Disney has its rewards."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"As a result of trying too hard to maintain the original's insouciant attitude, what was fresh now seems institutionalized, what was off the wall now feels carved in stone and the film's trademark irreverence has become dogma."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"The second ""volume"" of the open-ended franchise is simply not as charming as the original."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"The choice soundtrack, accompanied by the candyfloss aesthetic make for moments of fun, but it ultimately lacks the originality of the first."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"The characters are still fun to be around, the one-liners are still sharp...and the soundtrack is, of course, terrific. But there are only so many times you can slap on a Fleetwood Mac toe-tapper and expect it to paper over the cracks."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,60,"It’s fun, though GOTG2 doesn’t have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had. They’re still guarding, although the galaxy never seems in much danger."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,"The sequel is often loud, occasionally obnoxious and so consistently convinced of its own awesomeness that it will not, it cannot, stop pointing out everything that makes it so utterly wonderful."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,"Gunn maintains the unenviable job of giving each piece of his ensemble their due screen time to avoid making it the Peter Quill show, but the proceedings often feel manic, disjointed, and overstuffed."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,Vol. 2 aims to please with breathtaking set pieces that’ll convince you to delete all your old diatribes about CGI ruining the movies. But no matter how funny writer-director James Gunn wants this film to be — the one-liners move at lightspeed — too many of the punch lines are referential.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,It’s not the weighty emotions that drag Vol. 2 down. It’s the plot that chases its own tail and the cluttered visual palette.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,50,"In striving to surprise us every minute with its seen-it-all irony, Guardians Vol. 2 is actually the surprise-spoiler of all time—our every “Wow!” or “Haha!” has been scripted in advance."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7.7,389813101,38,It’s a rare misstep for the usually sure-footed folks behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,88,"Another “Jurassic” flick wasn’t necessary, but it’s a fantastic ride all the same."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,84,"It’s a brave choice to literally blow up everything that’s come before but one that definitely pays off in Fallen Kingdom. While Jurassic World gave us a lovely self-contained story, Fallen Kingdom leaves us wondering just where the series will go for its third act - as long as Stiggy plays an extensive pivotal role, I’ll be absolutely fine with it."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,83,"Howard, thankfully, gets more to do than the last go round (and in combat boots, no less!), Pratt busts out his Indiana Jones cocktail of can-do heroism and deadpan jokiness, and Bayona and his screenwriters (Trevorrow and Derek Connolly) test the laws of incredulity with varying degrees of success. At least, until the final half hour when forehead-slapping absurdity finally win out. Up until then, Fallen Kingdom is exactly the kind of escapist summer behemoth you want it to be."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,80,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is boggled insanity of the highest and most enthralling sci-fi order. As exciting and wondrous a summer blockbuster audiences could ask for. You must suspend reality (EVEN FURTHER) and enter a world where dinosaurs have existed for years in order to attain circumstantial nirvana, but if done correctly, an absolute wealth of ceremonious riches await"
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,80,"The fear factor is back. This is a Jurassic sequel that plays it both adrenaline-pumpingly huge and thrillingly small. A summer ride that will drive kids out of their minds, and maybe even give the parents nightmares."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,75,"Howard and Pratt don’t get to do much besides run like hell, but a movie like this in a way emphasizes rather than obscures the importance of star quality. They’re just so good-looking that it’s a pleasure to watch them -- idealized surrogates for humanity."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,75,I like the new “Jurassic World” movie better than the 2015 edition. Bayona’s direction is considerably more stylish and actively mobile than Colin Trevorrow’s was.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,75,"“Fallen Kingdom” is a more interesting, and less obvious, story than the usual Tyrannosaurus romps, which tend to be death-defying games of hide-and-seek."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,70,A more thoughtful and interesting film than its immediate predecessor.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,70,"Bayona not only nods to the histories of classic monster movies and the legacy of original Jurassic helmer Steven Spielberg; he brings his own experience to bear, treating monsters like actual characters and trapping us in a vast mansion that's as full of secrets as the site of his breakthrough 2007 film The Orphanage."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,67,"Bayona fights against the script’s weaknesses to craft a movie that, against all odds, feels fresh, fun and even a bit vital. A lot of it’s dumb, and the human characters haven’t gotten any more compelling than they were in Jurassic World, but dammit, everything involving dinosaurs is top-notch."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,67,Those who just want to watch dinosaurs eat people in creative ways? They’re destined to get their money’s worth.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,67,"There is visual wit in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and some invention, too."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,65,"There is a little bit of the wonder and joy that made the original so special embedded deep within Fallen Kingdom, which I credit to Bayona, whose primary drive, even in genre fare like this, has always been to sprinkle just enough emotion into the stories he tells."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"The opening sections has a feel of a competent if familiar effects movie, but the film changes mood and tone when story movies the foreboding castle — perhaps a nod to Mary Shelley, among the first to warn us of the hazards of scientists who interfere with the natural order."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"You can go see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom or you can save yourself the time and money by chugging a six-pack of Red Bull and running through the dinosaur exhibits at the Harvard Museum of Natural History until you can’t breathe. As experiences go, they’re equally adrenalizing and equally ephemeral."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"Has all the requisite rampaging dinos, dizzying action scenes and, sure, a few flesh-and-blood heroes running around saving the day. But there’s just not enough underneath that well-trod surface — an intriguing ethical conundrum bears heady fruit at times, yet is just as quickly shelved in favor of roaring lava or unleashed reptiles."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,63,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom will not stand up to rigorous scrutiny, and yet, it’s kind of an enjoyable, preposterous and thrilling ride that ticks through nostalgia beats like a shopping list."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is exactly what you think it’ll be. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is up to you.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"After a quarter-century the franchise may be terminally long in the teeth; much of this fifth iteration is absurd, both intentionally and un. Yet it’s also funny, intriguingly dark and visually sumptuous."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"Fallen Kingdom understands the moral weight of the setup it’s been handed by the previous five movies. Even when it stumbles as a film, it has a definite point of view on what a humanity callous enough to revive a species for its own pleasure and inquiry ought to experience in return."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"Fallen Kingdom understands that, as much as Jurassic Park has the shape of an action movie, its roots are in horror, and Bayona takes evident glee in drawing out his scares."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"After a first half that suggests franchise fatigue is setting in, Fallen Kingdom zooms in for some scarily good set-pieces."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,60,"This fun, pacy addition to the dino disaster franchise doesn’t do much that’s particularly new – though what it does, it does with a fair whack of panache."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,58,"Pratt brings a wry derring-do to the mayhem, and the escape from Isla Nublar has its modicum of thrills."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,58,"For a movie that preaches the importance of dinosaur freedom, it’s hard to watch something so caged by its terrible plotting and predictability."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,55,"Normally, the creatures lend this series a built-in sense of awe and wonder. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom strips that majesty away and turns the focus on the human characters, who are markedly unengaging."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the latest installment, has more dinosaurs, more screams, and more general chaos, but doesn’t make a single move to explore a fresh idea or add a new slant on a tired old formula. As brainless summer-escapism movies go, this one can’t go fast enough."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Here’s yet another incident-packed, steroid-pumped, dumb airport novel of a movie, with a few flourishes of Spielberg-inspired titanic imagery (though the director is J.A. Bayona) and a wall-to-wall John Williams-like orchestral score (by Michael Giacchino), with scenes that echo from the previous Jurassic Park movies."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Fallen Kingdom is so committed to thunderous spectacle that it fails to capture the poetry of these beasts in all their spiky, scaly, long-necked wonder. They deserve better."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Like almost every other major studio film this summer, Fallen Kingdom plays dumb, and happily."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Even the heavenly chorus that’s working overtime  on the soundtrack can’t drown out the lack of chemistry between Howard and Pratt. And the movie too often defaults to people running around screaming — which is, to be fair, the backbone of this franchise, but it gets awfully old here."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"“Fallen Kingdom,” directed by J. A. Bayona, is in most respects a dumber, less ambitious movie than its immediate predecessor, and also, for just that reason, a little bit more fun. Some of its high jinks have a hokey, silly, old-fashioned mad-scientist feeling to them, especially when the dinosaurs are chasing people or vice versa. Which is reasonably often."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"J.A. Bayona's film never figures out what it wants to be, casting about for a coherent tone. Thanks in large part to Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow's script, it doesn't find one. But at least it has some fun making the effort."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Cliffhanger elements aside, I have no desire to revisit this world again. It’s played out. There’s only so far you can go with dinosaur movie and this series has gotten to that point…and beyond. Fallen Kingdom isn’t dino-myte. It’s dino doo-doo."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"This is a movie that’s annoying in part because it doesn’t care if you’re annoyed by it. It doesn’t need you, the individual viewer, to like it. It just needs a crowd to see it. Whether you’ve been entertained or enlightened is immaterial. It’s Barnum time. You don’t like it? This way to the egress."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"This sequel has the perfunctory vibe that comes from filmmakers who cynically believe the public will buy anything T. Rex-related, no matter how shoddy the goods or warmed-over the plot."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"The special effects remain startling, and in your face. But there's nothing new here, and what's old feels like less. The corporate villains seem to have wandered over from ""Rampage."" The humor has vanished."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"J.A. Bayona's gothic flourishes suggest opioid hallucinations, and they're a welcome escape from the doldrums of the writing, but they seem at odds with the rest of the film."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Too often, Fallen Kingdom has all the soul and grace of a well-prepared business proposal—you can sense all the money being invested into an intellectual property in order to reap a sizable windfall and ensure the franchise’s continued commercial viability. It’s as scintillating as a retirement plan."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,The movie plays like a strenuous imitation of Steven Spielberg instead of the real deal.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"It’s possible to watch this movie, in other words, and feel that the series is carving out a new direction, returning to its ancient stomping grounds and sticking to a familiar holding pattern, all at the same time. Such is the repetitive, rudderless nature of so much big-budget franchise filmmaking, even with a proven talent like Bayona behind the camera."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"Spain’s J. A. Bayona is essentially stirring the same Jurassic pot here, with little that’s inspiring from his cast, unless you count the dinosaurs."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"It looks and feels familiar, and in an era where studio filmmaking has increasingly become an extension of brand management, that should make a lot of people happy. But I can’t say it made me particularly happy."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,50,"The first “Jurassic World” was, quite simply, not a good ride. “Fallen Kingdom” is an improvement, but it’s the first “Jurassic” film to come close to pretending it isn’t a ride at all, and as a result it ends up being just a passable ride."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,42,"The film may deliver the spectacle of dinosaurs body-slamming other dinosaurs with their mouths, but that’s about all that connects Fallen Kingdom to the wonder and fright of the original film. As a horror movie, it’s diverting enough when it’s not continuously shooting itself in the foot with ideas it can’t explain and doesn’t care to."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,42,"Like an amusement ride on its last legs, there is no wonder in this world anymore; just the repetition of cheap, worn-out jolts. The park is gone, and with it, so is any semblance of humanity."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,42,The Fallen Kingdom is at its worst when attempting topicality (the testosterone-fueled Wheatley refers to one of our heroes as a “nasty woman”) or when beefing up its crass plot.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,40,"In a film about resurrected dinosaurs, suspension of disbelief is mandatory, but the script’s illogical nonsense and flat, cartoonish characters compound on each other until any audience goodwill has evaporated."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,40,"The film staples together two snazzy-sounding ideas – an ecologically inclined disaster movie with dinosaurs, and, later, dinosaurs on the loose inside a stately home – without considering whether the end product’s sheer snarling hideousness might just prove an intelligence-insulting turn-off."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,40,"There are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to"
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,38,"There are at least four movies stuffed into Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and about a third of one of them isn’t half bad. I don’t think that math adds up to a decent film, but if all you need is a roaring dinosaur every 15 minutes or so, it might not matter."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,38,"How bad is “Fallen Kingdom”? How terrible is a movie that pounds us with a pretentious, nearly operatic score while indulging in B-movie clichés and calling for the main characters to make idiotic decisions just to keep the story rolling? I have to dig deep into the Awful Sequel Playbook to draw parallels to this exercise in wretched excess."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,38,"I was one of the few naysayers when the franchise was rebooted with “Jurassic World,” yet even with the bar set lower for expectations on this one, I found it “Transformers” boring, a summer movie that however much it earns, fails to justify its existence."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,37,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom finds another way to grow: by making its plot much, much bulkier. In doing so, it commits the worst possible sin: It makes dinosaurs boring."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,35,"Bayona, the Spanish director who first emerged with his terrific horror film The Orphanage, does his best to inject some more intimate action into a series that usually operates on an epic scale, but he’s working with too absurd a plot for his craft to really matter."
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,30,While it has its moments of passable action -- ends up feeling every bit as toothless as its dinosaurs are toothy.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,30,This isn’t just a film you need to “turn off your brain” to enjoy; nothing less than surgically removing your brain from your body would do the trick.
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,6.2,417719760,30,"The major problem with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom — the fifth installment in this dinosaur series, and the second of a prospective trilogy — is that the makers treat the action and suspense sequences in the way most of us go to the dentist."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,70,"Robin Hood is no classic, but if it sometimes seems like it’s trying to be “Baz Luhrmann’s Robin Hood,” more power to it. The movie is a diverting live-wire lark — one that, for my money, gets closer to the spirit of what Robin Hood is about than the logy 1991 Kevin Costner version or the dismal 2010 Russell Crowe version."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,63,"While it plays fast and loose with loaded political iconography, this Robin Hood brings a whole new dimension to this age-old tale."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,63,"Robin Hood’s shameless silliness only takes it so far, as the film is frequently undermined by Otto Bathurst’s wobbly direction."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"You could build a suspension bridge over the gap between what Robin Hood could have been and what it is. Its hero is credible as a man who wants to rob from the rich and give to the poor, but the storytelling is so impoverished that the message can't stick."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"Well, the Hood would never stand for it and neither should you. Defy authority and watch this movie on a plane instead."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,Say this and little else for the new Robin Hood movie: It’s less of a self-serious slog than the last Robin Hood movie.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,The action is violent and improbable but not staged with particular pizazz.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,Some of the film is slow. Some of it is silly.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"Grimly upbeat rather than merry, and relentless rather than frenetic, the film’s gritty zest is splashed across the screen with momentum, but also to the point of overuse. It serves a late heist set piece well, yet wears thin in a sea of training, thieving and fighting montages elsewhere."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,50,"On all fronts, it strives to twist the Robin Hood story into something more provocative, but ultimately it’s a garbled, hollow mess of attempts at relevancy."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,45,"It’s a straightforward retelling with a confusing design philosophy, disappointing action sequences, weak storytelling and a cast which clearly deserved better material."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,42,"Rife with stereotypes, a terrible script, and odd “300”-esque cinematography that just doesn’t fit, this is not only a film nobody asked for, but also one that nobody should be forced to endure."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"It’s a world that is so incoherent and inconsistent you almost have to admire the chutzpah, in which buxom lady horse-thieves dress themselves for a night of crime displaying several inches of showy cleavage, contained only by a glorified shoelace."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,This version will make you side with the Sheriff of Nottingham.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"Like Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur, this tries hard to do something new and exciting with an old formula. It quickly makes you wish for something more traditional and straightforward."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,40,"This bloated, featureless, CGI-heavy movie is not so much stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, as stealing from Guy Ritchie, Batman, Two-Face and a few others – and not giving back all that much to the audience."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,30,"Robin Hood isn’t as awful as all that, really. For one thing, it’s too singularly bizarre to be anything less than head scratchingly entertaining, and the action set-pieces are pulled off with much quivery panache."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,30,"The plot is twisty in a perfunctory way, the action predictably explosive, the sought-after exhilaration nonexistent."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,Egerton is miscast. He and Hewson have nary a spark in their love scenes. Dornan overplays his hand. Foxx belts out nearly every line as if he’s trying to be heard above a parade of fire engines on a Fourth of July parade
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"What balderdash. And not the fun kind, either."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"There’s nothing particularly memorable about Robin Hood even when you’re laughing at it, and that may be one of the saddest fates a movie can meet."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"The more invested you are in the old-fashioned Robin Hood of legend — the less likely you are to enjoy what amounts to a chilly and flavorless frappé of historical speculation, revisionist folklore and every lazy action-movie cliche ever written."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"The latest labored take on the old British legend, Robin Hood is little more than a pitch-black war film, complete with rudimentary medieval bombs and blood spatter on the camera lens."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,25,"If nothing else, this accidentally hilarious, goofy train wreck of an origin story most definitely has the courage of its convictions. Alas, the film isn’t smart enough to recognize that its convictions are dumb, and it doesn’t have the goods to back them up in the first place."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"This film, with its endless copying of Assassin’s Creed camera angles and state-of-the-art bullseyes, is an ugly machine, tiring to the eye, monotonously scored, and also weirdly regressive on quite a few levels."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"Arriving just in time to win a place among the year’s worst films, Robin Hood — bursting with an entitled sense of its own non-existent coolness — falls flat on its fat one."
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,A thoroughly incoherent movie salad.
Robin Hood,5.3,30824628,20,"Mendelsohn's villain is boringly one-note, Eve Hewson's Marion uses an incongruous Yank accent and always looks as though she's just stepped out of the makeup trailer, F. Murray Abraham swans around in fancy cardinal's vestments looking sinister and Foxx seems pissed off that he's not somewhere, perhaps anywhere, else. As for Egerton, he's a boy doing a man's job."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,100,"Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the finest movies yet from Marvel Studios, and a big departure in tone and storytelling from most of the films they've made so far.  It is a strong indicator that the more willing the studio is to experiment, the more exciting the payoffs can be."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,91,"Johnston and company are aware that introducing a hero means more than showing off his suit and gadgets or building up the universe he will eventually encapsulate. Before any of that, we must care about who he/she is."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,91,It gives you all that you could ask for when you buy a ticket to a thrill ride.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The movie surges ahead, moving nimbly through a series of action set-pieces that owe more to films like ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"" than they do to, say, ""The Green Hornet."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,Adding goofy uncertainty to shoulders as wide as the East River makes for a disarming hero in one of the spiffiest WWII action yarns ever to march out of Hollywood.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The best kind of comic-book movie. It's stylish and spectacular, yet it's rooted in history and human emotions. It's smart yet it's funny. It's wise yet it kicks ass when it has to. Just like the U.S. of A."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,88,"The most stylish comics-derived entertainment of the year...It's paced and designed for people who won't shrivel up and die if two or three characters take 45 seconds between combat sequences to have a conversation about world domination, or a dame."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Joe Johnston - returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort, ""The Rocketeer"" (1991) - creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting, and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Captain America isn't a masterpiece, but it's a solidly crafted, elegant adventure movie that held my attention from start to finish and sent me out into the street energized instead of enervated."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"This muscular, red-blooded adventure has a decent heart and the stuff of Saturday afternoon serials running through its veins."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"Captain America is exactly what the third week of July needed: a curiously fun, surprisingly imaginative and unashamedly old-fashioned yarn of skulduggery and adventure."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,80,"What really distinguishes Captain from the other superhero movies of 2011 (and quite frankly, the majority of the others released in the last several years) is a romance that feels like an integral - not incidental - component of the plot."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"What distinguishes Cap is his humble backstory, which involves neither hairy gods nor hot-dogging test pilots but a kid from Brooklyn who just wants to fight for freedom."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"While the story is preposterous and most of the cast standard-issue, it's hard not to like a comic-book movie that features both Busby Berkeley-style dance numbers and high-tech vaporizing weaponry."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"For the most part, it manages to balance laughs, genuinely rousing moments, and a fully packed agenda into something fleet enough to keep running under the weight of its rich ambitions."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Captain America might hold the most promise, not just of saving the world, but of saving comic book movies from themselves."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Succeeds where ""Thor"" didn't and the ""Incredible Hulk"" hasn't, twice. Unlike those drags, director Joe Johnston keeps things relatively simple and pleasantly stupid."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,It goes without saying it's preposterous. But it has the texture and takes the care to be a full-blown film.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"Stolidly corny, old-fashioned pulp fun."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,75,"The fourth comic book movie of the summer is the best comic book movie of the summer. Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump in the throat nostalgia."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Until the computer-generated effects bog it down and mess up its rhythms, Captain America: The First Avenger, has a measured, classical pace and a lot of good, old-fashioned craftsmanship."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"On its own, Captain America is a modestly engaging little-big movie in the median range: well below the first ""Iron Man,"" somewhat above ""X-Men: First Class."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Captain America is first and foremost an origins story. Almost half of the film's running time elapses before Rogers gets any kind of power at all, and though its elements are awfully familiar, it's the most involving part of the film because it takes advantage of Evans' performance."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Has a winningly pulpy, jaunty, earnest spirit."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,70,"Sticking to its simplistic, patriotic origins, where a muscular red, white and blue GI slugging Adolf Hitler in the jaw is all that's required, Captain America trafficks in red-blooded heroes, dastardly villains, classy dames and war-weary military officers."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Captain America falls into the prevalent pitfalls of origin stories. So much time and effort is expended explaining how the protagonist gains his super-powers (and exploring his initial usage of them) that there's not enough opportunity to develop a compelling storyline beyond his ""baptism."""
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"From its antagonists to its art direction, everything about Johnston's movie has a been-there, seen-that familiarity. Yet Evans' clean-cut idealism and objectives make old-fashioned patriotism look fresh."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,This is what the ongoing onslaught of comic book movies lacks: stars. Real stars. Robert Downey Jr. is the exception when he should be the rule. It's possible we take these movies for granted because the marketing tells us we should.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Here's the funny thing: Despite all the Captain America rah-rah in costume and indestructible shield, the movie is at its best when the story sticks with skinny Steve."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,63,"Tommy Lee Jones provides wisecracking levity as Rogers's commanding officer, Hayley Atwell supplies the aforementioned buxom chest and accompanying tough-girl grit as Rogers's British love interest, and Johnson directs with flair, his set pieces defined by both muscularity and clarity."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"The movie cleverly spins a meta-fictional ""origin"" myth for Captain America: explaining that he was in fact a propagandist comic-book superhero before becoming a real one. The final scene of the film, and Captain America's very last line, are rather brilliant – though admittedly less brilliant if their sole purpose is to set up sequels."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Captain America: The First Avenger is all utility. It has everything you might want from a movie of this kind — bangs, baddies, nonsensical backstories — except for the most important element of all: surprise."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Respect is due to Joe Johnston and his screenwriters for not only fashioning a nifty, highly entertaining slice of pulpy comic-book action, but for making this most divisive of costumed crusaders universally relatable."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"Charming, handsome and full of pep – all 70 year-old Cap lacks is a knockout blow. Still, Johnston should be saluted for old-fashioned heart in a cynical age, while Marvel should be confined to barracks for cynical marketing."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"The old-fashioned vibe, in fact, does more than just distinguish the story of skinny runt turned supersoldier Steve Rogers (Evans) from every other comic-book movie out there, though its fetishization of retro-techno gizmos and getups-call it leatherbucklepunk-immensely adds to the fun."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,60,"In the end, the action sequences are just overblown and dollar-squandering, with no particular payoff in the entertainment department. The supporting actors - particularly Jones, Tucci and Luke - are the thing to watch here; they do all they can to keep the movie's gears running smoothly."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,The final conflict is so protracted as to comfortably accommodate a bathroom break. Don't worry. You won't miss anything you haven't seen before.
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"Is there any doubt Evans' Captain America will do exactly what the character created 70 years ago by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby did in the comics – kick Nazi butt? The real surprise will come next year, when we get to see how the super-square Captain adapts to 21st-century life."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"Evans – always a reliably dynamic and vivacious screen presence – can't do much to bring the character to life. As far as superheroes go, Cap remains a bit of a stiff."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,50,"As Marvel heroes go, Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,40,"Once Captain America goes off to war in his endearingly silly suit, however, the movie starts to lose its vibe."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,40,"(A) hokey, hacky, two-hour-plus exercise in franchise transition/price gouging, complete with utterly unnecessary post-converted 3-D."
Captain America: The First Avenger,6.9,176654505,20,Captain America is simply awful. It is another hour and a half of prologue to the film people are apparently waiting for - The Avengers.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,75,"While it does take on the franchise burden in hefty doses, the film remains a fun, and funny, B-movie throughout."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,75,"While The Mummy isn't the big bang preferred to start the Dark Universe of classic monsters, it's a serviceable popcorn flick dangling hints of promising things to come."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,75,"The Mummy is a tomb full of action-packed guilty pleasure that owns its horror, humor and rampant silliness equally."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,67,"I’m not sure that this aimless, lukewarm take on The Mummy is how the studio dreamed that its Dark Universe would begin. But it’s just good enough to keep you curious about what comes next."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,63,"Action-packed and patently ridiculous, it’s all in good fun."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,60,It’s all patently ridiculous - and surprisingly watchable.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,60,"While there’s little here to jangle the nerves, The Mummy does wrap up enough adventure, action and quips to make it, if not a scream, a worthwhile Friday night out."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,60,"An odd but frothily entertaining genre cocktail, which coasts on the charisma of its two biggest names and keeps things just fun enough to forgive its considerable lapses in narrative."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,57,"Given that The Mummy only barely works as a movie on its own account, the question becomes whether it works as a franchise-starter. And the answer is that while its franchise elements are foregrounded, they still aren’t terribly compelling."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,55,"There are moments where it reaches out for horror and produces something interesting and distinct from Hollywood’s other blockbusters, but those moments are buried beneath unremarkable and, by the end, tedious action sequences."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,52,"As a commentary on the modern blockbuster, the movie’s fascinating. But as an actual movie, it’s fairly disheartening."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"The Mummy does have elements that are effective, especially Sofia Boutella in the title role, but with all the hurly-burly on screen the virtues get lost in the shuffle."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"The Mummy starts off light and very quickly goes dark — fading rapidly, along with our hopes that this latest monster mash might possibly be any good."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"Because the movie’s carrying a heavy load of corporate expectations, it gets pulled in different directions by competing agendas before eventually collapsing into incoherence."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,The Mummy is crippled by a failure of imagination.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,The Mummy is the rare Cruise film that doesn’t quite give audiences their money’s worth.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"Too much is at stake throughout, leading to formulaic plot filler and exposition that snuff out the spark of the early scenes."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,50,"The Mummy is a literal-minded, bumptious monster mash of a movie. It keeps throwing things at you, and the more you learn about the ersatz intricacy of its “universe,” the less compelling it becomes."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,42,"Unfortunately, The Mummy’s true curse is that it’s doomed to sacrifice its moments of fun, breezy spectacle for overwrought world-building."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"Ultimately, and perhaps most disappointingly, The Mummy winds up being not so much its own movie as what, by the end, feels like the first episode of a show that's already been renewed for several seasons. Because, in some respects, that's what it is."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"The nonsensical story would matter less if The Mummy would get out of Cruise’s way and let him do what he does best. Instead, it buries him beneath punishing dialogue scenes and surrounds him with unconvincing and unoriginal special effects."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,Everything about The Mummy strains solely towards setting up a franchise in a world which only makes sense to its writers.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"Weirdly out of place here, Cruise brings little daring and less charm to the film, though to be fair to the actor, his character's a stiff."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"The core of The Mummy is built around a mostly fun, fast-moving vibe, while its malformed midsection seeks to undermine anything good it has accomplished."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,It’s a ragbag of action scenes which needed to be bandaged more tightly.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,40,"Sure it’s got big, blurry action scenes, a plane crash, and an army of dusty, mindless zombies. But I think some of them may have been the screenwriters, because the movie’s practically lifeless."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,You only have to watch the trailer to know that Producer-Director Alex Kurtzman’s reboot of Brendan Fraser’s once-charming mummy movies is full of embalming fluid.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,"And the living are pretty lifeless themselves. As led by the often wooden Tom Cruise playing the U.S. soldier who inadvertently wakes the dead, and directed by an indecisive Alex Kurtzman, the cast is offered some passable action sequences but struggles with weak dialogue and uneven comedy."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,"Narratively incoherent and full of cheese and camp, this movie makes it clear that the mummy should have remained dead and buried."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,38,"It’s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,37,"The big thrills and few laughs are no match for the cumbersome, convoluted story, not to mention the nonexistent chemistry between Cruise and Wallis."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,"It’s big, it’s slick, it’s very, very Hollywood, but it’s just not that good a film. It’s not even as much fun – and monster movies, as opposed to horror movies, should be fun – as the 1999 Brendan Fraser vehicle of the same name."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,"The Mummy turns out to be a drab, nonsensical affair that squanders its potential for humor, atmosphere and sweep."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,"This isn’t a new breed of terror, just another neutered reboot churning all the same mainstream gears."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,30,This “Mummy” is rags that produce no riches.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,25,It's a monster fail.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,25,"The Mummy is so wall-to-wall awful, so cheesy, so ridiculous, so convoluted, so uninvolving and so, so stupid."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,25,"The mayhem in The Mummy feels desperate, mistimed, grueling in the wrong way (the film's violence is infinitely less appropriate for preteens than that of ""Wonder Woman"")."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,20,"The “Mummy” reboot from 1999, directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, was kind of fun. Monster movies frequently are. This one, directed by Alex Kurtzman and starring Tom Cruise, is an unholy mess."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,16,"The Mummy is a dated, empirically dismal, laughable excuse to kick off a franchise, and it should have remained entombed."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,16,"It’s not that it’s bad, it’s that it never could have been good. It’s an irredeemable disaster from start to finish, an adventure that entertains only via glimpses of the adventure it should have been."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,10,"Cruise seems weariest of all, flogging outdated merchandise he can’t even pretend to believe in. It’s not Cruise that feels ancient; it’s The Mummy."
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,0,The Mummy is not your usual lousy movie. It has been made with skill and hits its marks. But those marks are so low and so brazenly mercenary that it doesn’t feel like much of an achievement. It’s not involving.
The Mummy,5.5,80101125,0,A movie that goes beyond defying comprehension to being truly incomprehensible.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Rian Johnson’s film is the real deal, a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"While there are some solid nuggets of deep-cut easter eggs for hardcore fans, what is so extraordinary about The Last Jedi is that this is the first post-Lucas Star Wars film that feels free to dance to its own beat."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"It’s not a perfect movie, but it may be a great one."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Like many before it, The Last Jedi has already been hailed as the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, and while that’s true, it’s too faint a compliment. It’s a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi launches the franchise to another level of action and humor thanks to incoming writer-director Rian Johnson, whose imagination seems boundless as George Lucas’ 40 years ago."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"An excellent middle chapter bursting with wit, wisdom, emotion, shocks, old-fashioned derring-do, state-of-the-art tech, and stonking set-pieces."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Easily its most exciting iteration in decades — the first flat-out terrific “Star Wars” movie since 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back.” It seizes upon Lucas’ original dream of finding a pop vessel for his obsessions — Akira Kurosawa epics, John Ford westerns, science-fiction serials — and fulfills it with a verve and imagination all its own."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Sure, it’s just a space Western, but “Star Wars” is one of the our most popular modern mythologies. Johnson respects that. He’s infused the storyline with new energy and artistry, and I can’t wait to see it again."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"Writer/director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a sprawling, incident- and character-packed extravaganza that picks up at the end of “Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens” and guides the series into unfamiliar territory. It’s everything a fan could want from a “Star Wars” film and then some."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,"A triumph of comic irreverence and dramatic purpose, Episode VIII dazzles like the sci-fi saga hasn't in decades."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,100,It’s less Star Wars as you’ve never seen it than Star Wars as you’ve never felt it.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,97,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the quintessential Star Wars movie. It embraces everything in the franchise that came before while taking big risks to push the story into new and unexpected places.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,93,"The movie is smart, stirring and deeply exciting, but more than anything, it is surprising. This is a Star Wars movie that plays with your assumptions and upends them, but it never betrays the story, characters and ethos at the series’ core. It expands the idea of what a Star Wars movie can be. It’ll knock you over."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,91,"Under the fastidious guidance of writer-director Johnson, The Last Jedi turns the commercial restrictions of this behemoth into a Trojan horse for rapid-fire filmmaking trickery and narrative finesse. The result is the most satisfying entry in this bumpy franchise since “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"No matter how much money has been poured into a movie, it’s emotional generosity that matters, and Johnson gives without squandering. His great gift is that he knows when to stop."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The new Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is shockingly good."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"What’s important in The Last Jedi is what happens to, and what we find out about, all of these characters along the way. In retrospect, The Force Awakens feels like a short introduction to these characters. After The Last Jedi, I feel like I’ve gone on a week-long road trip with them all."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever)."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is striking, stunning, visually hypnotizing, thrilling - everything ""epic"" about the famed franchise rolled into a tremendously overcharged start to Rian Johnson's Star Wars career."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The Force is, to me, still silly Star Wars mumbo jumbo, but Johnson finds a way to underscore it with humanity, with a classical Greek rumble of true pathos. On that front, The Last Jedi is a pure success, accessing the molten core of its drama and grappling with it in nuanced ways."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The space battles and lightsaber duels are appropriately exciting, but Johnson keeps a close eye on the human element that girds this galactic odyssey. Rather than simply regurgitating Star Wars’ past, The Last Jedi emphatically builds on it."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"The new movie truly passes the torch by making the next generation of Resistance heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and new addition, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) — every bit as compelling as the old guard. Even more surprising, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) evolves from the whiny brat in “The Force Awakens” to a three-dimensional menace."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,90,"There are images in this movie that provoke awe and delight, and creatures that feel lifted out of half-remembered childhood dreams. And though it briefly appears to lose steam in the middle, that’s short-lived, with a third act harboring sequences that feel like a maestro conducting a concerto the size of the cosmos."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,89,"While Abrams peddled name recognition, Johnson understands that the classic characters have to reignite the torch before they can pass it on, and gives both Leia and Luke defining moments."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has more than enough action, humor and stuff blowing up to thoroughly satisfy fans of the long-running franchise."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"The Star Wars universe is the best toy box a fanboy could ever wish for, and Johnson makes sure that Jedi is bursting at the seams with knockout fun surprises, marvelous adventure and shocking revelations that will leave your head spinning."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,Last Jedi is deep. It’s also rollicking. It’s right up there with the very first “Star Wars” in terms of its enjoyability factor. It’s a triumph.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Much will be resolved by the final chapter of the trilogy, to be directed by Abrams. As much as I enjoy his brand of canny populism, I prefer Rian Johnson’s wilder, generous, far-flung imagination."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"The Last Jedi tries to do a little too much in its overlong 2½ hours, yet writer/director Rian Johnson still turns in a stellar entry that owes much to George Lucas’ original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound. As is the case with all of the “Star Wars” films, where there is evil there is heroism, and where there is bravery there is sacrifice — and sometimes where there is love, there is heartbreak."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,88,"If having pure fun at a “Star Wars” movie is wrong, I don’t want to be right. So for me, The Last Jedi falls right behind “The Empire Strikes Back” and maybe the original film in providing the thrills and the heartbreak, the heroism and villainy, and the romance and betrayal that makes these films such a treat even for those of us who can’t name all the planets or the alien species or even the Empire’s flunkies."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"By the rousing final act, Johnson has brought an apocalyptic grandeur to the lightsaber duels and airborne combat. His often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma—and the texts—of the old way."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,The film simply drags too much in the middle. Somewhere in the film’s 152-minute running time is an amazing 90-minute movie.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"Audiences will likely come away from The Last Jedi with a lot of complaints and questions. But they’re at least likely to feel they’re in the hands of someone who cares about the series as much as they do, someone who loves its history, but sees the wide-open future ahead of it as well."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,Rian Johnson’s main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,83,"“Star Wars” has always been about destiny, fate, and legacy. However, perhaps like no film in the franchise yet, The Last Jedi seriously considers the hubris that comes with certainty, and how knots from the past that can keep you bound from moving forward."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,"The Last Jedi checks off all the boxes you want from a Star Wars movie, including one of the coolest lightsaber fights in the series’ 40 years, but Johnson is also interested in exploring new territory, including a consideration of the shadings and nuances to the Light and Dark Sides of the Force."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,"If The Force Awakens raised a lot of questions, The Last Jedi tackles them head-on, delivering answers that will shock and awe in equal measure. Fun, funny but with emotional heft, this is a mouth-watering set-up for Episode IX and a fitting tribute to Carrie Fisher."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,80,The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It’s a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe – a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has. And there is no provisional hesitation or energy dip of the sort that might have been expected between episodes seven and nine.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"By breaking down some of the old mythology, Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a “Star Wars” film feels forward-moving."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the eighth movie in the series and one of the better ones. I’d rank it behind “The Empire Strikes Back” (still by far the best) and the first film, but it’s about on par with the enjoyable last episode, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which also awakened the long-moribund franchise."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"The Last Jedi is a film of moments. There are perhaps a half-dozen of them: goose-pimple inducing, fist-pump encouraging, heart-racing bursts of cinematic satisfaction. The problem is that the narrative threads connecting them are lazily knitted and sometimes tangled or broken."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi unspools like a one-movie binge watch, a lively if overlong and busily plotted second chapter to the latest Star Wars trilogy that advances the story and deepens its characters with a combination of irreverent humor and worshipful love for the original text."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"You don’t see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it’s all about and whether any of it was worth it. It’s this element that gives The Last Jedi an extra something, a fascinating melancholy undercurrent."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"These sequels trade directly on the emotional legacy of the originals (The Last Jedi makes some leaps into sentimental hyperspace, particularly in the way that it handles Fisher on-screen), and the more of the aged Luke and Leia we see, the more we chip away at the mythic power of characters as Lucas left them: Young, strong, immortal."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,75,"For all its strengths, The Last Jedi is a very manic film, fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Does the movie, like its predecessor, rely on familiar tropes a bit more than it should? Yes, I think it does. Is it, at a solid two-and-a-half hours, considerably longer than it needed to be? Yes, that too. But it’s still a pretty damn good movie, arguably the best the franchise has offered since Empire."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"While Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good movie and a worthy entry, it would have been stronger if Johnson didn’t telegraph those new directions before leading us to them."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"A narrative that mixes, not always successfully, stirring moments and sensational action with angst and grim conflictedness on a galactic scale."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Although The Last Jedi meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson’s effort is ultimately a disappointment. If anything, it demonstrates just how effective supervising producer Kathleen Kennedy and the forces that oversee this now Disney-owned property are at molding their individual directors’ visions into supporting a unified corporate aesthetic."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,70,"Loaded with action and satisfying in the ways its loyal audience wants it to be, writer-director Rian Johnson's plunge into George Lucas' universe is generally pleasing even as it sometimes strains to find useful and/or interesting things for some of its characters to do."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,63,The latest entrant in this now-Disney-owned franchise is largely content to further the themes and narrative strategies of J.J. Abrams's predecessor.
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi yokes Johnson’s formidable cinematic intelligence to an elaborate feat of fan service that feels, above all, like the rhetorical and dramatic gratification of a religious sect."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Ridley, full of charming spunk playing a skeptical rebel recruit in The Force Awakens, is the biggest disappointment here. She is less engaging now that she is committed to the fight and plays most of the later action on a single note of earnest desperation; Johnson's script leaves her little else."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,7.1,620181382,50,"Intentions and inspiration aside, Last Jedi doesn’t add up to an “Empire Strikes Back” for this trilogy. There’s no romance, little pathos and no real punch-in-the-gut moment. Its emotionally sterile tone was set with “The Force Awakens,” and that’s proven hard to shake, new innovations and plot twists aside."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"A fully believable, flesh-and-blood (albeit not human flesh and blood) romance is the beating heart of ""Avatar."" Cameron has never made a movie just to show off visual pyrotechnics: Every bit of technology in ""Avatar"" serves the greater purpose of a deeply felt love story."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"It's been twelve years since ""Titanic,"" but the King of the World has returned with a flawed but fantastic tour de force that, taken on its merits as a film, especially in two dimensions, warrants four stars. However, if you can wrap a pair of 3D glasses round your peepers, this becomes a transcendent, full-on five-star experience that's the closest we'll ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. Just don't leave it so long next time, eh, Jim?"
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"Once again, [Cameron] has silenced the doubters by simply delivering an extraordinary film. There is still at least one man in Hollywood who knows how to spend $250 million, or was it $300 million, wisely."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"This is, simply put, one of the most beautiful movies you’ll ever see."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"A quantum leap in movie magic; watching it, I began to understand how people in 1933 must have felt when they saw ""King Kong."""
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"Avatar's shock and awe demand to be seen. You've never experienced anything like it, and neither has anyone else."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,Glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,Avatar is entertainment of the highest order. It's the best movie of 2009.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"At the end of a decade defined by much bellyaching about ""the death of cinema"" (including, on occasion, by this critic), Avatar concludes, appropriately enough, with an image of rebirth."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,100,"Pantheism, Cameronism: In Avatar, what's the diff? Now he's king of a world he made from scratch."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Avatar is all-enveloping and transporting, with Cameron & Co.'s years of R&D paying off with a film that, as his work has done before, raises the technical bar and throws down a challenge for the many other filmmakers toiling in the sci-fi/fantasy realm."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Embrace the movie -- surely the most vivid and persuasive creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures -- as a total sensory, sensuous, sensual experience."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"The movie's story may be a little trite, and the big battle at the end between ugly mechanical force and the gorgeous natural world goes on forever, but what a show Cameron puts on! The continuity of dynamized space that he has achieved with 3-D gloriously supports his trippy belief that all living things are one."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Much of the time, though, you're transfixed by the beauty of a spectacle that seems all of a piece. Special effects have been abolished, in effect, since the whole thing is so special."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,90,"Is it or is it not stupendously friggin' rad? And the answer is yes. For most of the first hour, a good portion of the second, and even many of the 40 minutes left after that, Avatar is stupendously friggin' rad."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,89,"It's thrilling and lovely and sad and explosive in all the right ways, and it needs to be seen – on the big screen, in 3-D – to be believed."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,Tone-deaf but thunderously exciting.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,Rarely less than absorbing and never boring over its nearly three-hour length.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,"An entertainment to be not just seen but absorbed on a molecular level; it's as close to a full-body experience as we'll get until they invent the holo-suits. Cameron aims for sheer wonderment, and he delivers."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,88,"Avatar delivers. Combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility - not to mention a love angle, an otherworldly bestiary, and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry - the movie quite simply rocks."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,83,"If I never felt entirely transported by Avatar, it's probably because the story thudded just as often as the imagery soared. But Pandora is still a good place to park yourself for three hours."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,83,"Is it a great movie?  Maybe not.  But it is a great step forward in moviemaking.  Shrug it off if that makes you feel better, but starting today you live in a post-Avatar movie world."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"The first 90 minutes of Avatar are pretty terrific - a full-immersion technological wonder with wonders to spare. The other 72 minutes, less and less terrific."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"As visual spectacle, Avatar is indelible, but as a movie it all but evaporates as you watch it."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,The scenes in Pandora -- a planet with an Earth-like environment -- are so breathtaking that the narrative seems almost beside the point.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,Titanic technical achievement.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"By presenting Avatar in 3-D, Cameron is staking his claim and building a fence around his own precious resource, making it unobtainable on any but his own terms to increasingly emboldened and technologically savvy natives."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"Avatar is a king's ransom fairly well spent, not least because Cameron's invitation into his superbly crafted universe comes with an unexpected price: He makes it easy to gaze fondly on all this movie magic, but only in exchange for a hard look at ourselves."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,75,"Vast, beautiful and meticulously detailed."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,70,"Avatar is a technological wonder, 15 years percolating in King Cameron's imagination and inarguably the greatest 3-D cavalry western ever made. Too bad that western is ""Dances With Wolves."""
Avatar,7.8,760507625,63,"Whatever faults Avatar may have -- and there are many -- the movie succeeds in immersing you in a photorealistic, painstakingly detailed world more fully than any science fiction movie before."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,60,The question lingers as the movie comes to its triumphant body-swapping close: Is this a pro-environment parable or a prophecy of virtual realities yet to come? Cameron's new world may very well be a verdant Matrix.
Avatar,7.8,760507625,60,"Avatar clears the hurdle in terms of being optical candy. Its story, though, is pure cheese."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,50,"Avatar is a weak patchwork of his other films: the leaden voiceover from ""Terminator 2"" here, the military/civilian conflict from ""Aliens"" there, even a Jack-and-Rose-style forbidden love story cued to adult-contempo soundtrack."
Avatar,7.8,760507625,50,"It is a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of ""Attack of the Clones."""
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"At the root of that is Civil War’s greatest strength – and the reason it makes all thought of the recent Batman v Superman debacle evaporate on contact. The Russos’ film has an unshakeable faith in these decades-old characters: they’re not wrangled into standing for anything other than who they are, with no gloss or reinterpretation or reach for epic significance required. This is the cinematic superhero showdown you’ve dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that’s everything – and all – it wants to be."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"What makes Captain America: Civil War such a terrific accomplishment is the way it takes what could have been the most crass and overcrowded story to adapt as a film and instead transforms it into an examination of just who these heroes are and what impact they’ve had on the world around them, and vice versa."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"If there’s a risk of the Marvel ‘formula’ becoming stale, there isn’t any evidence of that here. Civil War isn’t just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn’t offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward. Team Cap or Team Iron Man? The real winner here is Team Marvel."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,100,"Matching its blockbuster scale and spectacle with the smarts of a great, grown-up thriller, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel Studios’ finest film yet."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,91,"More than any previous Marvel adaptation, Civil War conveys the comics' light touch amid somber circumstances. In a bold stroke, those circumstances are of the heroes' own making."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,91,"Despite its stars-and-stripes title, Marvel’s latest billion-dollar-blockbuster-to-be, Captain America: Civil War, is essentially a third Avengers movie – it’s also the best one yet."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,91,"Striking and consistently engaging, the Russos deftly craft compelling blockbuster entertainment out of a a moral and emotional conflict, and that’s more impressive than any overblown display of loud and vulgar power."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,90,"The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America drives a wedge through this community of heroes. And they fight, in one of the most joyous cinematic superhero battles ever filmed, the closest thing we’ve seen to an on-screen splash page."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,90,“Civil War” strikes that admirable balance: serious-minded action that never forgets to indulge in serious fun.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"At the end of the day, it’s still a comic-book movie, but one that actually raises serious questions about security, accountability and revenge."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,Captain America: Civil War appeals to me more strongly than any superhero movie of the last decade.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,In nearly every way Civil War represents the dizzying heights of the genre.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"Kudos to the Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, for directing the hostilities for maximum impact and without neglecting character. Their thundering epic is also smart,  snappy, politically savvy and blessedly fast on its feet."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"After the nihilistic deconstruction of Deadpool and the flattening self-importance of Batman v. Superman, Captain America: Civil War reminds you how funny and exciting these pictures can be when they’re done right — you know, like comic books. The summer movie season has barely begun, and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,Captain America: Civil War is a classic example of what the big-ticket summer movie experience is all about.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,88,"While it’s not the greatest Marvel effort — that honor goes to the previous Captain America: The Winter Soldier — Civil War does pull outstanding performances from its two franchise faces, Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,85,"The way in which Captain America: Civil War brings together a dozen or so heroes, sorts them into not one but two teams and then flings them at each other is its own special delight for comic book fans long accustomed to such things on the printed or digital page. And it must be pretty exciting for non-fans, too."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,84,"In terms of narrative ambition, and giving meaningful screen time to an ever-growing stable of onscreen characters, Civil War rivals Joss Whedon's MCU standout The Avengers. And in terms of sheer thrill, it surpasses Avengers — at least for fans who come prestocked with an emotional investment in these characters."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,83,"That Civil War doesn’t collapse under the weight of its various moving parts, that it manages to be the most serious entry yet in this franchise of franchises without sacrificing much in the way of valuable comic relief, is a testament to the creative mojo of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,83,"By firmly rooting all of the film’s sprawling drama in a singular conflict, directors Joe and Anthony Russo manage to do what many superhero films have struggled with in recent years: find a truly effective reason to pit superpower against superpower."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"Marvel’s new “Captain America” is anything but bleak — what’s so audacious about the film, and so pleasing, is its quicksilver mix of hardcore action and bright comedy."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"Fun, happily, is one of the many ingredients in copious supply here."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"It’s that rare superhero movie that doesn’t grind you down with nonstop action or, worse yet, the usual tiresome cavalcade of smart-ass wisecracks."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"It’s a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"A nagging sense of incompleteness means that Civil War isn’t quite as satisfying as the first ‘Avengers’ (it’s all building up to the ‘Infinity War’ two-parter in 2018). But overall, this is Marvel at their best: a pacey, intelligent super-sized blockbuster and a roaringly fun night out."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"This chronicle of an epic clash between two equally noble factions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, proves as remarkable for its dramatic coherence and thematic unity as for its dizzyingly inventive action sequences."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"Civil War is an exciting, often giddy pop pleasure."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,80,"While slightly overlong, this movie is bright, creative, insightful, affecting and, above all else, fun."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,78,"Civil War’s main battle sequence is so effective because it’s six-on-six, and we’ve spent the past decade getting to know the combatants."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Who emerges as the winner of this “Civil War”? The audience. The picture delivers in a big, big way."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in Captain America: Civil War, which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Those who attend this movie expecting to see a superhero smack-down won’t be disappointed, but anyone partial to Captain America’s saga may feel shortchanged."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"With every new installment of the comic book franchise, the scale gets bigger, relationships get trickier, new forces enter the fray."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"They’ve built up a vast ensemble of character types, all of them played by better-than-average actors, and that they can mix and match the drama, comedy, or action as they see fit."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Crisply photographed, thoughtfully acted and often refreshingly amusing, “Civil War” injects doses of much-needed fun into a genre of filmmaking that’s become mired in dour pretentiousness, when it’s not ridiculing its own excesses in such meta-snark exercises as “Deadpool.”"
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Thanks to strong performances, deft writing, and clear, snappy direction and editing, this newest volume of the Marvel Cinematic Universe manages to be at once a thoroughly entertaining standalone story while also serving and benefiting from stories that came before."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,75,"Nothing in “Civil War” takes your breath away. All the exteriors are shrouded in the same overcast, indistinct light. Little in story terms is what you’d call daisy fresh. But almost everything in it works on its own prescribed terms, and the quiet moments register."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,70,"This very crowded, reasonably enjoyable installment in the Avengers cycle...reveals, even more than its predecessors, an essential truth about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s not so much a grand science-fiction saga, or even a series of action-adventure movies, as a very expensive, perpetually renewed workplace sitcom."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,70,"If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,70,"Posing serious questions about violence and vigilantism while reveling in both, Captain America: Civil War is overlong but surprisingly light on its feet. It builds upon the plotlines of previous Avengers outings, bringing together known marquee quantities and introducing the Black Panther and a new Spidey in winning fashion."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,67,"The action, directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, is thuddingly effective without being terribly imaginative, but at least it’s not in the clobber-the-audience “Transformers” category."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,63,The undeniable fun of Civil War's action scenes only exacerbates the failure of the narrative to adequately contend with its own themes.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,I personally find the Russo brothers’ lightning-fast action scenes difficult to process — it’s as if cinema editing now exceeds the speed of human brain functions — but they’re undoubtedly exciting and skillfully constructed.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,"Those who sit through its talky, belabored first half will be rewarded first and foremost with the finest fight scene of any ""Avengers"" film to date, one that doubles as a satisfyingly popcorny start to the summer season."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,The best way to think of Captain America: Civil War is as a toy box in which the sheer quantity of toys partly makes up for the lack of anything new. But the big takeaway is worrisome. Marvel has created a universe teeming with superheroes who simply don’t have enough to do. They’re all suited up with nowhere to go.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,"I never found myself genuinely wondering what was going to happen next; the moves are too familiar. Even the big fight, entertaining as it is, feels like it's there not because of dramatic inevitability, but because somebody behind a desk decided it had to be. It's just a bunch of stuff."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,60,"There's a certain bloatedness to much of the first half, while the film in general lacks the balance of humour to hard-hitting found in Shane Black's superb Iron Man 3 and/or Whedon's two Avengers outings."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"As the feigning wears off, and Captain America: Civil War crawls to a close, you sense that the possibilities of nature have been not just exceeded but exhausted. Even the dialogue seems like a special effect: “You’re being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal,” Black Widow remarks to Iron Man. Translation: “Say something.”"
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"After the first two “Captain America” entries, the finest comic-book movies of the last five years, this one is disappointing. The story doesn’t make sense."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,Robert Downey Jr. gets to remind everybody that before this blockbuster turn he was actually a serious actor and may still be again. Stark’s frustration at the rigidity and short-sightedness of his confreres and his anguish at where it all leads are vivid and felt.
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"There’s a “for fans only” feel to the latest “Avengers” movie, Captain America: Civil War, that won’t be to every taste. A talky, often ponderous exercise in comic book movie elephantiasis, it overdoses on characters, old and new, sometimes not even bothering to name them."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"Sometimes, more is less. Although it’s called Captain America: Civil War, the latest Marvel movie is actually a supersized “Avengers” picture -- overstuffed to bursting."
Captain America: Civil War,7.8,408084349,50,"The bigger these movies become, the smaller they feel. The more aggressively they reach for greatness, the more clearly they prove that its beyond their grasp. Marvel movies don't get much better than this. The trouble is, they don't want to."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,100,"Doctor Strange doesn’t always make sense — but so what? It’s a mind-blowing special-effects extravaganza, and the most exciting comic-book flick since “Deadpool.”"
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,"Doctor Strange doesn’t break formula, and no, they will never ever be able to surprise us with his origin story again. It’s still head, shoulders and cloak above so much of what’s being churned out the seemingly bottomless vaults of Marvel and DC Comics."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,"What Robert Downey, Jr. is to ""Iron Man"" and Ryan Reynolds is to ""Deadpool"" – that's what Benedict Cumberbatch is to Doctor Strange. By that I mean, he's everything."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,You know you’re in a top-drawer Marvel Comics adaptation when even the Stan Lee cameo is clever.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,88,"The action climaxes with a truly impressive finale, one that employs time going in multiple directions that’s like nothing I’ve ever seen in a movie before. The effects shots here aren’t just visually impressive; they actually let the narrative go to places it couldn’t without this level of, you’ll pardon the expression, wizardry."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,"For the first time, a Marvel movie draws that pencil line from dream to screen. Where the earlier films felt hard and shiny and steel-colored — the look of bashing action figures on a sidewalk — Strange is ink-smudged and obsessive. It's defiantly old-school — not the cozy, apple-scented nostalgia of the first Captain America film, but that cold, back-of-the-library whiff of eraser nubs and mold."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,A nice balance of solemn myth making and genre irreverence lifts Doctor Strange to Marvel's first tier of movie franchises.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,"Doctor Strange lacks the bloat that’s made other recent, blockbusting superhero films fall flat. It doesn’t lean too hard on the considerable talents of its stars, nor does it waste their talents. It keeps a brisk pace, but doesn’t rush. It gets weird, but not too weird. And if all else fails, it’ll make your jaw drop from time to time."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,83,Doctor Strange is thrilling in the way a lot of other Marvel movies are. But what makes it unique is that it’s also heady in a way most Marvel movies don’t dare to be. It’s eye candy and brain candy.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,This is a rare case in which Marvel has freed a director’s imagination instead of  straitjacketing it.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,One of the pleasures of Doctor Strange is the way it both wholly embraces and gently mocks the unapologetic geekiness of the enterprise.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Ultimately, though, it’s Doctor Strange’s return to its protagonist’s long lost psychotherapeutic roots that works best."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"The space-and-time warping and mirrored realities in Doctor Strange are a blast. They’re inventive enough that they awaken wonder, provoking that delicious question: How did they do that?"
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"While it hardly pushes the envelope in terms of developing Marvel's homogenous narrative conveyor-belt, it does do so in other areas, suggesting that the MCU can see beyond the confines of its first two phases."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"A bizarre and beautiful detour on the Marvel journey, which culminates in a mind-bending, expectation-inverting final act. Not to be watched under the influence."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Perhaps the strangest aspect of Doctor Strange, within the lockstep rubric of these things, is how non-Marvelly it manages to feel."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Cumberbatch fits Doctor Strange like a pair of snap-tight surgical gloves, in yet another MCU triumph. Beautifully designed, brilliantly executed."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"It’s a tremendously engaging and likeable superhero ride, in which the classiest of casts show they know exactly where to take it seriously – and where to inject the fun."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"To his credit, director Scott Derrickson...navigates through the different zones with a fair degree of actual coherence, and delivers the entire package with evident ease and some flair."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,80,"Yes, this new project shares the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen as the rest of Marvel’s rapidly expanding Avengers portfolio, but it also boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,78,"A tight, compact, and visually sumptuous origin story that revels in the surrealistic vision of Doctor Strange’s legendary creator and artist Steve Ditko."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Although the comic book tropes are all in place, the acting, tone, and visual effects keep them from becoming tedious. This is yet another solid building block in the foundation to Marvel’s ever-expanding superhero fortress."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Director/co-screenwriter Scott Derrickson generally keeps the massive enterprise moving smoothly along. The trip’s the trip here, and it’s well worth taking."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"With a mischievous, metaphysical flourish, Doctor Strange administers some much-needed CPR to the flagging superhero genre. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel — a power-hungry villain (Mads Mikkelsen) tries to unleash hell on Earth, blah blah blah — but it’s a heck of a lot more fun than I’ve had at a Marvel movie lately."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,The upshot: The movie develops a distinctively trippy identity.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Cumberbatch fleshes out a portrait of uncompromised and resolute selfhood. In that way, he carries us and the movie over some long stretches of blue-screen emptiness."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,“Cool enough” doesn’t do justice to this blockbuster’s city - and reality-bending set pieces. “Awe-inspiring” is closer.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"This latest in the ever-broadening Marvel movie landscape is fun. For an effects-laden franchise launch it's light on its feet, pretty stylish, worth seeing in Imax 3-D (for once, the up-charge is worth it) and full of tasty, classy performers enlivening the dull bits."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,Nothing that Marvel Studios has produced can compare to the visual splendor of Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,75,"Derrickson (Sinister) crafts a trippy phantasmagoria for Strange to fly screaming through as he begins his path to sorcerer supreme. The only thing missing is a Doors jam as the sequence unfolds a dizzying blend of psychedelia, geometric oddities and nightmarish dreamscapes."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"Doctor Strange has one significant quality that most Marvel adaptations lack: A sense of humor about itself, which it wears as lightly as the most gossamer Cloak of Levitation."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"Derrickson’s use of computer-generated action is a strength instead of a strain, and it’s not just showing off; in the context of the film, the bizarre images make sense."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,Doctor Strange is at its most entertaining when it’s unapologetically different from anything Marvel has done before.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"It's not all that strange, but it's restlessly arresting and always technically impressive. Unlike most studio franchise fantasies, Doctor Strange rewards the eye rather than assaults it."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,70,"Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,67,"Make no mistake; there is no disputing this is clearly one of Marvel’s better efforts. And, yes, attempting to break from the expected shackles of a lineage of other origin movies is difficult, but you still feel the formula straining at the core of Doctor Strange."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,67,"As with all of the best installments of the MCU, the film’s unique strengths have a perverse way of highlighting the franchise’s shared weaknesses. But Doctor Strange deserves credit for treating several of the ailments that have been infecting the series, and for diagnosing several more."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,63,"All in all, Doctor Strange is a fun and trippy excursion to a place where Marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,63,The film is surprisingly engaging. It’s fun.
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,63,"For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn’t the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise. Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we’ve seen countless times."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"Doctor Strange is the psychedelic kung-fu spectacle that Marvel hoped director Scott Derrickson would deliver, but it’s got a strange problem – the doctor himself."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"It's fun to have new version of an old Marvel favorite, and a storyline which adds some genuine mysticism to this ever-expanding franchise. But ""Strange"" is too often only odd when it needs to be truly magical, and Hollywood-safe when it needs to be brave."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"There are sequences in Doctor Strange that could burn the top layer off your eyeballs, crammed as they are with some of the most unashamedly drug-inspired imagery since the ‘The Simpsons’ episode where Homer takes peyote. But problems arise when Doctor Strange tries to tackle the everyday stuff, like telling a half-decent story."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,60,"The bad news is the studio’s most innovative visuals are wedded to one of its most formulaic origin stories. In some scenes, Doctor Strange is Marvel’s most exciting movie yet. In others, it might be its most boring movie since Iron Man 2."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,58,"Allow me a quick lament: Do we really want to see a great actor like Cumberbatch, not to mention Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tilda Swinton, entombed in yet another superhero franchise?"
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,58,"This superhero adventure, like most of Marvel’s output, is well-paced enough with a few interesting ideas up its sleeve (including a refreshing climax featuring anti-destruction) that it should thus hold one’s attention. But for being devoid of a compelling story at its center, one walks away from Doctor Strange feeling as empty as the magic on display."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,50,"Little by little, though, unfunniness takes hold. Stephen’s training grows interminable. The mysticism turns deadly serious. The effects turn repetitious: Worst of all, the plot loses its way just as Stephen is coming into his own as a worthy antagonist of Kaecilius, a villain — or is he? — played with hollow-eyed intensity by Mads Mikkelsen."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,38,"If that wasn’t enough, there is something even more dispiriting about Doctor Strange beyond its halfhearted visual and narrative ambitions – an issue that made a brief blip on the cultural radar when the film was first announced but has distressingly gone unheard of since: This is a movie that revels in whitewashing."
Doctor Strange,7.5,232641920,25,"People who ask nothing more for their money than a lot of nerve-scrambling computerized special effects might get through Doctor Strange, another in a long line of lengthy, stupid and unbearable Marvel Studios comic books on film, with minimal brain damage."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,90,An expertly designed theme park ride of a movie that packs nonstop thrills.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,70,"The plot is about as ridiculous as you'd expect, but for the most part its absurdities are tolerable."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,60,"Despite all the flash and filigree, this monster movie is curiously -- and conspicuously -- lacking in heart."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,58,"There are some clever and exciting sequences, but this $120 million epic of reconstituted Atomic Age trash lumbers more than it thrills."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,"Size really is about all that this tedious, underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,Godzilla is so clumsily structured it feels as if it's two different movies stuck together with an absurd stomping finale glued onto the end.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,This Godzilla is lacking both the awesome spirit of the original and the sublime silliness of the more recent Toho outings.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,"It probably would have benefited from a 20- to 30-minute trim and, certainly, a smarter script, but the special effects truly are amazing."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,50,"The movie is of minimum interest; the story of the movie, however -- or, rather, of the way in which it has been engulfed by its own publicity -- is bound to fascinate connoisseurs of cultural meltdown."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,40,"The year's most eagerly anticipated green-eyed monster finally rears its ugly head, not with his trademark radioactive roar, but a deafening yawn."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,40,"Casting aside the forgettable ragbag of a cast, tiptoeing round the leaden script, and avoiding the story's many pot-holes (how come he only breathes fire twice?), Godzilla does provide plenty to look at. But that, for fear of sounding ungrateful, is all."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,38,"A big, ugly, ungainly device to give teenagers the impression they are seeing a movie."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,38,"The script isn't just ""dumbed down,"" it's lobotomized."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,30,"They do it up big, but their frame of reference -- mostly old sci-fi movies and TV shows -- is pint-sized."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,30,"For the single-digit age set, Godzilla is sure to be the greatest movie of all time."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,25,"When a movie is nothing but relentless action, there's little chance for dramatic tension to develop."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,25,"An overblown action monstrosity with no surprises, no exhilaration and no thrills."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,25,"The dialogue is dumb ('zilla has the best lines, ""arrrrrggh"" and ""maaroarrr""), New York is waterlogged, and Godzilla isn't on screen enough."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,20,The makers of Godzilla obviously devoted so much manpower and time and energy and money to the admittedly fabulous special effects that they apparently had no budget left over for actors.
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,10,"Overlong, neither funny nor scary movie about a big lizard."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,10,"While the special effects are impressive, countless films have already proven that if you sink enough money into a project, you can at least make it look good. Unfortunately, good looks are all Godzilla has going for it."
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,10,"Size vanquishes both substance and subtlety in the overhyped, half-cocked and humorless resurrection of dear old ""Godzilla."""
Godzilla,5.3,136314294,0,Watching inept American actors and wishing they were badly dubbed into Japanese isn't any fun at all.
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"A grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Star Wars is, quite simply, one of the best family entertainment buys you can make this summer. It’s a gorgeous, fantastic toy, a marvelous science fiction film that anyone can enjoy, sci fi fan or not."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"It is, on the other hand, enormous and exhilarating fun for those who are prepared to settle down in their seats and let it all wash over them. Which I firmly believe, with the extra benefit of hindsight, is more or less exactly what the vast majority of the cinema-going public want just now."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"I loved Star Wars and so will you, unless you're . . . oh well, I hope you're not...Star Wars is a hell of a lot of fun and Lucas makes fun a sparkling pop metaphor for the sheer joy of goodness that could even make friends out of men, mutations and machines."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"An exhilarating update of ""Flash Gordon,"" very much in the same half-jokey, half-earnest mood, but backed by special effects that, for once, really work and are intelligently integrated with the story."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"If I were asked to say with certainty which movies will still be widely known a century or two from now, I would list ""2001,'' ""The Wizard of Oz,'' Keaton and Chaplin, Astaire and Rogers, and probably ""Casablanca'' ... and ""Star Wars,'' for sure."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Like all great craftsmen, Lucas has managed to fashion this material in a manner that not only honors the original sources, but makes it uniquely his own. Hacks rip off other movies; artists synthesize and pay homage to their inspirations."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Star Wars, set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” is the most exciting picture to be released this year — exciting as theater and exciting as cinema. It is the most visually awesome such work to appear since “2001: A Space Odyssey,” yet is intriguingly human in its scope and boundaries."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"A marvelous child of Star Wars technology, the advanced sound design makes a celebratory re-viewing of George Lucas' legendary, 20-year-old space opera a thrilling experience. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"A magnificent film. George Lucas set out to make the biggest possible adventure fantasy out of his memories of serials and older action epics, and he succeeded brilliantly."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"The aerial dogfight Dykstra and Stears have helped Lucas perfect as his climactic piece de resistance looks more exciting than its antecedents in live-action war movies. Its the most gorgeous stylized combat sequence since the underwater battle at the end of ""Thunderball,"" a project that won an Oscar for Stears."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,Lucas combines excellent comedy and drama and progresses it with exciting action on tremendously effective space battles. Likeable heroes on noble missions and despicable villains capable of the most dastardly deeds are all wrapped up in some of the most spectacular special effects ever to illuminate a motion picture screen. The result is spellbinding and totally captivating on all levels.
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,Star Wars is the most entertaining sci-fi movie of the decade.
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,100,"Star Wars is somewhat grounded by a malfunctioning script and hopelessly infantile dialogue, but from a technical standpoint, it is an absolutely breathtaking achievement."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,90,"There is something dazzling about a sci-fi film that manages to call upon the energies of both futurism and long-held faith. The movie is not to be compared in ferocity of imagination with Kubrick’s “2001”—significant that the music here is merely illustrative, never caustic or memorable, and that there is nothing of Kubrick’s vision of a blanched form of existence—but it is exuberantly entertaining."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,90,"Star Wars brought back for a new generation many of the most attractive elements of studio-era moviemaking, and it did so in breathless anthology form. For some young filmgoers this film acted as a doorway to the glory of the movies."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,90,"Star Wars had all the right stuff, and unlike its confounding progenitor, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it was fairy-tale simple: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,"" good met evil. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,88,"Let's discuss those extra four minutes for a second, shall we? I found them incredibly distracting. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,80,"Everyone treats his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor that avoids condescension. One of Mr. Lucas's particular achievements is the manner in which he is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,80,"Still packs an entertaining punch with its blend of old-movie formulas, new-age philosophies, and video-game visuals. A small amount of new material, added for the 20th-anniversary reissue, is fun to look for but doesn't make much difference to the story or its impact. [Special Edition]"
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,80,"Rendering all of its materials with a self-protective tongue-in-cheek tone, Star Wars is fun. But if the movie appeals to the child in all of us, it also may seem to the adult within a good deal less delightful. There's something depressing about seeing all these impressive cinematic gifts and all this extraordinary technological skills lavished on such puerile materials."
Star Wars,8.6,322740140,75,"Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a “future” cast to them: Human beings, anthropoids, or robots, you could probably find them all, more or less like that, in downtown Los Angeles today. Certainly the mentality and values of the movie can be duplicated in third-rate non-science of any place or period."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is some kind of miracle. It works on every imaginable level - as a heartfelt love letter to fans, an irresistible invitation to newbies, a visual marvel and a blockbuster of unparalleled emotional heft and cultural significance."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,The Force Awakens barrels back into Lucas' 'lived-in' universe with inextinguishable energy and boundless joie de vivre.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not perfect nor could it ever be. But for every niggle...there are 10 things that are exactly right, and it says much that no one will leave disappointed despite going in with hysterical levels of expectation."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Rarely have age and shining youth been juxtaposed more affectingly, but that’s only one of many moments of grace in a movie that mines its resonant mythology while moving its story ever forward."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The Force Awakens reveals surprising connections, begins a few bromances, solves mysteries while digging up others, and sets a strong tone for what comes next in Star Wars lore. Best of all? It’ll make you feel like a kid being introduced to something truly special once again."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The storytelling in The Force Awakens is masterful, in that it seems to be taking its time but is always moving relentlessly forward and coming up with surprises."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"Perhaps the greatest triumph of Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that it justifies the enormous hype. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Michael Arndt and Lawrence Kasdan, director J.J. Abrams (“Star Trek”) brings fresh energy to the franchise while adhering to the storytelling values that made it matter in the first place."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"From the off, JJ Abrams’s film sets out to shake Star Wars from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past. That it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"What a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising and heart-thumping adventure this is."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The rollicking, space-opera spirit of George Lucas’s original trilogy (you can safely forget the second trio of cynical, tricked-up prequels) emanates from every frame of J.J. Abrams' euphoric sequel. It’s also got an infusion of modern-day humor that sometimes steers the movie this close to self-parody—but never sarcastically, nor at the expense of a terrific time."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"It must have seemed like a nearly-impossible task when JJ Abrams and his collaborators set out to bring ""Star Wars"" back to life, but they've more than done it. They've made something honest and beautiful and, above all, fun, and I find myself energized by the movie and by the promise it represents."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,100,"The Force Awakens is ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity. What a Christmas present."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,91,"If the sequels to “The Force Awakens” are as good as this film, that will probably be because they follow the same formula: heavy on the human side, more comedy, less CGI, more fresh faces, and more delightful droids. And, yes, one must pay homage to the Force."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,"All you really want to know is whether it's good, right? Well, in fact, it is better than it had to be."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,"What Abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round: fun...There are some laugh-out-loud moments here, but also some touching ones. Happy, sad, exciting, silly — all that is included, along with the original sense of Saturday-morning-serial abandon that made what became known as “A New Hope” so wonderful all those years ago."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,"Mr. Abrams may be as worshipful as any Star Wars obsessive, but in The Force Awakens he’s made a movie that goes for old-fashioned escapism even as it presents a futuristic vision of a pluralistic world that his audience already lives in. He hasn’t made a film only for true believers; he has made a film for everyone (well, almost)."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,90,Abrams and his collaborators have made a movie that feels resoundingly fresh and new by paying tribute to a style and story that is decades old.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"The action, from lightsaber duels to X-wing dogfights with TIE Fighters, is explosive and buoyed by John Williams' exultant score. And the movie is also funny as hell. Abrams knows how to build a laugh and fill the emotional spaces between words."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"The film ultimately runs up against the limitations of its own nature.... But it’s still an exhilarating ride, filled with archetypal characters with plausible psychologies, melodramatic confrontations fueled by soaring emotions, and performances that can be described as good, period, rather than ""good, for 'Star Wars.'"""
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"If Hollywood’s going to extend the most famous movie myth of the past 40 years, The Force Awakens seems a worthwhile way to do so."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,88,"Abrams understands what George Lucas never quite figured out: that we’re less interested in the science fiction future than we are in revisiting the past. We don’t really want to see what happens next in that galaxy far, far away. We want to recapture what it felt like the first time we arrived, in 1977, with a movie called “Star Wars.” We want to go home. Star Wars: The Force Awakens takes us there."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"Star Wars is fun again. Fans whose love for the series was forged with the Original Trilogy will see too much they recognize (and, later, missed) not to love this effort."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"The Force Awakens accomplishes its fan base mission, bringing back a modern myth with the torch-passing respect it deserves (plus some crass commercialism it doesn't)."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"The ending he’s come up with for The Force Awakens feels so perfect it’s hard to imagine it any other way. In an age when we’ve all become binge watchers, we feel as if it’s become our right to immediately roll right into the next episode, the next sequel. And when The Force Awakens ends, it’s bittersweet because you so badly want to head right into the next chapter."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,83,"Snazzily directed by J.J. Abrams with vibrant effects and a busy plot that sets the whole franchise in motion all over again, The Force Awakens delivers on expectations with a fun, polished space odyssey that embraces the appeal of the originals."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,"Like their Star Wars forebears, Boyega’s Finn and Ridley’s Rey are brave, funny, and admirable but also imperfect, uncertain, and sometimes afraid. That is to say, they’re genuine, multisided characters with believable motivations—no small victory in a movie designed with the express purpose of breaking world box-office records."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,"Robustly entertaining while carrying the weight of impossible audience expectations, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fascinating, often satisfying mixture of rollicking mythmaking and fan service."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,"Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn’t work in Lucas’ prequels, and he’s gone in the opposite direction. He’s also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,Star Wars: The Force Awakens pumps new energy and life into a hallowed franchise in a way that both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,You would have to be practicing some pretty dark arts to not smile as you watch the iconic Millennium Falcon take off into battle one more time.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,80,The prequels this ain’t. We can all breathe again.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is not a great film, but it flirts with that designation far more often than this lapsed fan could have ever expected. If, on a creative level, what’s contained herein is ultimately the planting of seeds that will continue growing two, four, or forty years down the line, I suspect this franchise is in its best-ever state. How fortunate that it also stands alone as a good time at the movies."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"The Force Awakens is half reboot, half remake, and all fun."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,So what’s the final verdict? A mixed bag. It’s a good start to a new trilogy but hardly the hoped-for masterpiece. It’s a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the ‘70s and ‘80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Ridley is the picture’s real find. Her Rey is fearless, forceful, resourceful, and with a hidden side to her personality that slowly manifests itself and will surely be more deeply explored in the sequels."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. Filled with incident, movement and speed, dusted with light layers of tarnished “used future” grime, it captures the kinetic energy that made the first film, from 1977, such a revelation to filmgoers who marveled at Lucas’s mashup of B movies, Saturday-morning serials, Japanese historical epics and mythic heft."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"If Abrams didn't take many chances, he didn't make many mistakes, either. First, Do No Harm became Don't Mess With Success, and it worked. Show Me the Money is sure to follow."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"It is good. Not great. But far better than ""not bad."" Solidly, confidently good."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Abrams makes big decisions and takes chances that command respect, especially in the very safe current tentpole film industry, but he doesn’t always quite sell them as he could. Still, as this new chapter props the franchise back up on sturdy legs, the Force seems to be in capable hands with a fresh forward direction."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"Abrams and Kasdan’s respective humor and pathos push the characters beyond some of the more rote and redundant storytelling. So while it’s not always compelling, it’s always fun."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,75,"What Abrams has done is strip Star Wars down to its core components, rearranging the stuff people liked about the original trilogy and getting rid of what they hated about the rest."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"By temperament, Abrams is more of a Spielbergian than he is a Lucasite. His visual wit may not be, as it is for Spielberg, a near-magical reflex, but nor is Abrams suckered into bombast by technological zeal, as Lucas has been, and the new movie, as an act of pure storytelling, streams by with fluency and zip. To sum up: “Star Wars” was broke, and it did need fixing. And here is the answer."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"The movie has already blown away advance-sale records, and when you go (which, of course, you will) I bet you’ll have fun — I did, mostly. But it’s the fun of seeing something fairly successfully redone, with the promise of more of the same to come."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens steers the franchise back to its popcorn origins. It's not a Bible; it's a bantamweight blast. And that's just as it should be: a good movie, nothing more."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"Although Star Wars has always been about the past, The Force Awakens is ironically at its best when it looks the future."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,70,"The reassuring familiarity of Abrams’ approach has its limitations: Marvelous as it is to catch up with Han Solo, Leia and the rest of the gang, fan service takes priority here over a somewhat thin, derivative story that, despite the presence of two appealing new stars, doesn’t exactly fire the imagination anew."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,67,"Still, as a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard Star Wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters, The Force Awakens is exactly what it needs to be: an old-school Saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,It exists less as a meaningful extension of its world than as a fan-service deployment device.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,"What’s missing in The Force Awakens – and this is a major, critical flaw – is a fresh story template, a plot that doesn’t build toward a climax you’ve already seen, played out in practically the exact same way. That’s the kind of failing that a lot of fans will overlook while they bask in the undeniable bliss-out the movie delivers. But in hindsight, as you play the film back in your mind, the huge lack of imagination and freshness become more problematic."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,"The shamelessness with which Star Wars: The Force Awakens replays the franchise’s greatest hits is startling. To put it another way, it’s a satisfying meal — but it’s $200 million worth of leftovers."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,63,It tells a well-crafted story; the new characters are invigorating; the old characters are reintroduced tidily. But it is also far too enamoured with the power of its own history.
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,60,"When you’ve been charged with reviving one of the most obsessively beloved franchises in modern movies, is it better to defy expectations or to meet them? With Star Wars: The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams splits the difference, and the movie suffers—in the end, it’s perfectly adequate, hitting every beat. But why settle for adequacy?"
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,60,"You can choose to understand The Force Awakens as an embrace of the mythological tradition, in which the same stories recur over and over with minor variations. Or you can see it as the ultimate retreat into formula.... There are moments when it feels like both of those things, profound and cynical, deeply satisfying and oddly empty."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,60,"Though a definite improvement on the last three abortive Star Wars prequels directed by series creator George Lucas, The Force Awakens is only at its best in fits and starts, its success dependent on who of its mix of franchise veterans and first-timers is on the screen."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8.0,936662225,50,"The Force Awakens boils down to a couple of genuine lump-in-the-throat moments, and those are due to nostalgia. The rest? Seen it, done it, been there, and remember it — even though it was “a long time ago.”"
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,100,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a vast improvement on “Ant-Man” (2015) — and one of the most entertaining releases from Marvel Studios.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,88,"It’s fast, it’s funny, it’s superficial, it’s full of likable stars and scientific mumbo-jumbo, and, above all, it taps into the human urge to see big things become little and little things get big. It’s as close to lizard-brain entertainment as superhero blockbusters get, and as the mercury pushes toward 100, I’ll take it."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,84,"Boasting some of the most creative action scenes and finely-calibrated comedy in the Marvel universe so far, Ant-Man and The Wasp doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it certainly knows how to make the ride even more fun."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,83,"Ant-Man & The Wasp somehow manages to organize laughs, action, theme, small MCU connections and even fairly touching ideas about family, responsibility and what it means to be a hero all housed inside of an undersized blockbuster."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,81,"Given how much of the film is spent on watching tiny items grow to improbable size, and huge objects shrink down to the scale of toys, it seems only appropriate that Ant-Man and the Wasp neatly balances its big, serious concerns with its little petty ones. It’s a movie that understands all the variances of scale, and takes the audience along for the ride as they constantly change."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,It buzzes with uncomplicated enjoyment.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Though Rudd and Lilly spark off each other just as appealingly as before, the more urgent point is for Lilly to earn The Wasp her equal billing, which she very much does."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"With well-balanced humour, and a heartfelt father/daughter narrative, Ant-Man and The Wasp makes for refreshing viewing after the gasp-inducing drama of Thanos clicking his fingers. Sometimes, focusing on the smaller stories is just better."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hilariously, fun action-flick that takes the edge off the tragic ending of Avengers: Infinity War."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"It’s funny how little things, like personality, can lift a movie. Ant-Man and the Wasp features kinetic action sequences, but what makes it zing is that Mr. Reed has figured out how to sustain the movie’s intimacy and its playfulness, even when bodies and cars go flying."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"The action scenes are complex masterpieces of speed and stunts that combine physical bits with fresh, exciting 3D effects."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"With inventive action and a gag-rate that bests most comedies, Ant-Man and the Wasp is the kind of slick entertainment you’ve come to expect from the MCU, with Rudd and Lilly’s winning double act at the centre."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a movie of deliberately low stakes and, for that very reason, enormous charm."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is firmly on the B-movie end of the Marvel spectrum, a happy enough place to be: clacking along with all its bug friends, for the moment unfussed about Thanos and geopolitics. It seems pretty nice. Would that we could wrestle the rest of the world down to that same agreeable scale."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Paul Rudd and his equally likeable cast mates find the heart and humour in familiar comic-book theatrics, resulting in a film which is less concerned with generating awe than in delivering plenty of goofy grins."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,80,"Ant-Man and the Wasp has a pleasingly breakneck, now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t surreal glee. It’s a cunningly swift and delightful comedy of scale."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,78,"Yes, the action sequences are hilarious, and yes, the design department gets to cut gloriously loose with the kaleidoscopic, shifting microverse of the Quantum Realm, but this is first and foremost about family."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"We’re hardly in original territory when a movie relies not once, but twice, on truth-serum humor — but even when things get ultra-corny, “Ant-Man and the Wasp” keeps merrily buzzing along."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,Felt like it was missing something. Something fun. Something small.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"For some Marvel devotees, Ant-Man and The Wasp will be a clever enough diversion in between the more main-event releases. But it’s pretty much exactly what I’d want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Ant-Man and the Wasp moves, mainly on the strength of snappy repartee and visuals. Ignore the plot and live in the moment – kind of a quantum concept right there – and it’s entertaining enough."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Taken in its entirety, Ant-Man and the Wasp may not be the best anything, but, like its perpetually challenged hero, it is plenty good enough."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Escape means a roller-coaster finish, and with this delightful sequence achieved without the aid of computer effects, this “Ant-Man” entry stakes its own corner of the Marvel Universe sandbox as a throwback to ’80s-style childlike adventure."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"For better and worse, Ant-Man And The Wasp knows it’s small potatoes."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Ebulliently funny, visually inventive, and above all passionately committed to the idea that heroism isn't a burden but an uplifting realization of our best qualities."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,The thrill of the film is watching Ant-Man and the Wasp team up and raise hell together. Rudd is a winning combination of sass and sincerity. And it's a kick to watch Lilly break out and let her star shine.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a two-hour mental break when a lot of people could need a mental break. If this sounds like I’m being condescending to this movie at all, I promise you I am not. I mean this as a huge compliment. It’s so lighthearted and everyone in the movie is so darn pleasant and they all seem to like each other, it kind of feels like the most fictitious Marvel movie to date."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Despite its considerable charms, Ant-Man and the Wasp is decidedly not a must-see event. In fact, it sometimes feels less like a movie than an episode of an ongoing superhero TV series. But it’s a really, really good episode of that series. And it’s the perfect antidote for the gravity of Infinity War."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"While Ant-Man's technically “the star,” this is most definitely the Wasp’s movie to own, and the smirking, enjoyably no-nonsense role fits Lilly well."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,75,"Visually here’s the crucial thing with Ant-Man and the Wasp, and it sounds like a small thing, but really it’s a big thing: The sequel has upped the instances and exploits of the rapidly changing superheroes, and every time the movie cuts to a shot of the heroes’ miniaturized car, scooting around the streets of San Francisco, it’s good for a laugh."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,72,"For audiences who like Marvel movies at their tongue-in-cheekiest, this sequel provides some breezy fun while we wait to find out just how permanent Thanos’ genocidal schemes really are."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"Ant-Man and the Wasp bets on everything that worked about the first movie—it’s a light and sunny entry in the ongoing Marvel canon that gets by on the cast’s easygoing chemistry. And, of course, on all the shrinking and growing."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"The best thing, though, is the movie’s modest scale. It’s a good-natured epic, dedicated to the nontech principle of dispensing plain old pleasure."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"Much like ""Ant-Man,"" it's a kind of pressure-relief valve, coasting on Paul Rudd's goofy charm. That's more on display than in the first film; returning director Peyton Reed manages not to shrink Rudd's appeal when he shrinks his character."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"It’s busy, harmless fun. Very, very busy."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,The result is an effects-laden goofball comedy in which anything goes and nothing matters. Not that this is an entirely plot-free extravaganza or just an excuse for comic riffs. But the filmmakers are so cavalier about the idea that any of this is supposed to make any sense that there's a certain liberation in not burdening two human-brained insects with the fate of the entire universe.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,70,"Ant-Man And The Wasp is the kind of playtime entertainment suited for Scott Lang's better-when-on-a-team personality, loaded with size-shifty sight gags and lower stakes worth Paul Rudd's ensemble stardom."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,67,"Ant-Man and the Wasp may never achieve that level of surrealist humor, but as a series of amusing quips and inventive setpieces, the rest of the Marvel family could learn a thing or two from the scrappy small-scale of their tiniest colleague."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,67,"The essence of Ant-Man is inherently silly, and that’s where the strength of the new movie lies."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,63,Ant-Man and the Wasp is still beholden to an overwritten superhero/sci-fi storyline that involves lots of quantum talk and way too many players.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,63,"There’s too much convoluted plot...and the movie at times feels big and ponderous, like Ant-Man when his malfunctioning suit does the opposite of its normal effect.... There are also too few jokes, and though Rudd and Peña work like mad to get laughs, they  come up well short of optimal levels achieved in Thor: Ragnarok."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,63,"As “Guardians” and, later, “Deadpool” doubled down on the snark, “Ant-Man” kept things light, its playfulness made all the more endearing by the boyish, twinkle-eyed persona of its star, Paul Rudd."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It may not be as significant to the Marvel canon as, say, Black Panther but the skittish wit and playfulness wins us over."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It has to be more of the same, but better, and the movie doesn’t quite succeed. You can’t really make a bigger, better Ant-Man — that just means defying the diminutive, carefree scale that made the earlier movie work in the first place."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"While it proves an all-round well-mounted distraction, Ant-Man And The Wasp undeniably lacks the scale and ambition of recent Marvel entries."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"Yet that prickly view of fatherhood is what I kept coming back to as the fizz of the movie faded away. It makes Ant-Man and the Wasp feel like something more distinct than just the Ant-Man sequel, and helps it stand out from the other two movies Marvel put out this year."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It’s disjointed, and cluttered, but it’s also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough? Just about, and not quite. Ant-Man and the Wasp overloads and underachieves, but it also never entirely squanders the first film’s good will."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,60,"It’s about as unassuming as a movie about a man who can grow 65 feet tall could be, and in its relatively subdued scale, it is fairly refreshing and fun."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,58,Ant-Man and the Wasp is working too hard to look unconvincingly relaxed.
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,57,"The movie is ultimately harmless, trivial puffery that vanishes from your brain as quickly as you experience it."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"Good things come in small packages and life’s little pleasures are to be treasured, but Ant Man and The Wasp — together, equal-billed and boring — are too little of a good thing."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"Ant-Man and the Wasp offers nothing close to what we have come to expect from entries into the MCU. Plodding, repetitive, replete with technobabble nonsense and lifeless action, this is easily the worst-written of any of the 20 MCU offerings and may be the worst all-around film featuring a Marvel superhero since Sony rebooted Spider-Man."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"There’s a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all.... Think of it as torture by blah-blah."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"Reed, a comedic wizard, generates some moments of giddy wonder, but the earlier film’s freewheeling, low-key loopiness is replaced by a dull and dutiful plot that, with its forced references to other Marvel installments, squeezes the action to fit the franchise."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,50,"The first flick had a lot going for it: clever cinematography, a refreshing irreverence and Paul Rudd’s boyish charm. But “Wasp” is scant, man."
Ant-Man and the Wasp,7.1,216648740,40,Even Peña and an able supporting cast that boasts a bear-hugging Bobby Cannavale are hamstrung by a script where too many jokes fall flat.
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,91,This is a case of all the elements lining up and pushing a potentially good film into the great category because of just how well executed it is.
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,91,"Vaughn and his collaborators have taken a crude and disposable property and turned it into something more – a thoughtful, exciting, whip-smart spy adventure that doesn't let its smart-ass post-modernism overwhelm its playfulness or its heart."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,90,Kingsman: The Secret Service is a spy movie made by James Bond devotees who know the genre so well that they can have a good time with it while also paying it respect -- and taking it to someplace new entirely.
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,90,"Those more devoted to the genre can debate whether Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman is the best comic-book movie of the last few years. What's beyond argument, however, is that Vaughn has whipped up the most interesting one, the only to make ferocious, unsettling art out of the great contradiction of superheroic fantasy: jolly do-goodism and its brutalizing sadism."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,88,"Firth is brilliant. He’s playing a veteran super spy in a very violent but very silly movie, but even when Harry is explaining why there’s a dead stuffed dog in his bathroom, Firth gives a disciplined, serious performance."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"A brazen, subversive send-up of 007, Kingsman: The Secret Service also has the high-octane excitement to work as a spy film on its own merits."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Things go from far-fetched to insane before it's over, and Vaughn wisely keeps the pace at a healthy clip. But never underestimate his power to floor you."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Firth might appear like an odd choice for an action hero, but he makes a surprisingly convincing one in the Roger Moore mold, the sort of unflappable British gentlemen who can kick your ass without wrinkling his suit. He’s a great straight man for Jackson and some of the movie’s sillier elements as well; Firth has this unshakeable dignity and poise that even the most vulgar moments in Kingsman can’t puncture."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is so well served in terms of gags, action and style that it bodes well for another savvy spy franchise and even more so for the star potential of Taron Egerton."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Injecting fun and fairground thrills back into the spy movie, Kingsman is a blast. Firth is sensational, Jackson rules and newcomer Egerton surprises. Mission accomplished for Matthew Vaughn."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Despite the presence of grandfatherly Michael Caine, Kingsman’s tone is about as far from the Christopher Nolan-style superhero film as you can get. Verisimilitude is frequently traded in for a rich laugh. The action scenes delight with shock humour."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a startlingly enjoyable and well-made action film leavened by humor and slicked along by style, made by, for, and about people who’ve seen far too many Bond films."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,80,"Perhaps the riskiest mainstream movie in years, Vaughn’s love letter to spy movies may be uneven in places, but it’s ultra-violent, envelope-pushing, and fun enough to overcome the flaws."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,78,"Kingsman: The Secret Service may lack the sophistication of its peers, but damned if it doesn’t know how to have a good time."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"At heart, “Kingsman” is a comedy, though granted, one with abundant dismemberments and literally mind-blowing violence. And I mean “literally” in the very strictest sense of the term."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Kingsman is as violently kinetic as anything Vaughn has made, a list including Kick-Ass (the good one) and Craig's U.S. breakthrough, Layer Cake. But Kingsman is also wildly uneven, often slowing its roll to stiff-upper-lip pacing necessary (or not) to create a new British secret agent movie mythology."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Fast-paced with a morbid sense of humor and copious pop culture references, Kingsman breezes along at a nice clip until it gets a little bogged down during its final third."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"A lively, dashing and amusing motion picture that smartly spoofs and slyly celebrates the James Bond spy-film franchise."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"It’s also a movie that further establishes Vaughn as one of the edgier and more underrated genre voices of the moment, and that makes us wonder why Colin Firth hasn’t indulged in an action sideline all along."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Kingsman delivers on its promise of escapist fun, with a touch that alternates between Galahad’s old-school polish and Eggsy’s roguish charm. Like the rookie who knows that you have to make a few mistakes while following the master, the movie shrugs off its missteps with a wink and a smile that makes them easy to forgive."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Mashing up satire, subtle social commentary, clever gadgetry, keen wit and high-octane style, this spy saga — based on the comic book series The Secret Service — is bolstered by a terrific cast."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"OK, got it. It's a spy movie spoof, ""Austin Powers"" with more violence and less camp, a Bond parody that zeroes in on the Roger Moore era, when the sets and gadgets got bigger and the stories got dumber."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Kingsman is all over the place, sometimes to its detriment. But you won’t want to miss the surprises it delights in springing."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,75,"Speaking of young men, newcomer Taron Egerton, playing Harry’s protégé, delivers a star-making performance flush with the kind of charm and unexpected gravitas that no amount of flashy filmmaking can fake."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"It's a lot of fun. But there's also something very bizarre about Kingsman. Namely, its politics are incredibly strange, wildly vacillating between a kind of egalitarian progressivism and the equivalent of shrugging wildly and saying, ""Who cares! The status quo is fine!"""
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"Kingsman is full of elaborately orchestrated violence and acrobatic stunt work, shot in fast, sinewy, CGI-enhanced long takes that push and pull our perspective this way and that. It’s all very silly and not really meant to be taken seriously, but as the story gets more and more brutal, something strange happens: We start to care for these cartoonish characters and this absurd scenario."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"Directed by ""Kick-Ass"" action specialist Matthew Vaughn with slightly more vigor than necessary and a shade less restraint than needed, it's a bit too too to be ""brilliant,"" as the Brits say. But it's not half bad either."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"Director Matthew Vaughn strikes an energetic balance between cartoonish action and character-driven drama... The mix grows less seamless and the story loses oomph as it barrels toward its doomsday countdown, but the cast’s dash and humor never flag."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,70,"While seriousness has overtaken the Bond franchise in recent years (hardly a bad thing, mind you), Kingsman runs no such risk. Vaughn welcomes details that might seem silly in another director’s hands, such as a bulletproof umbrella or tiny microchips that can make one’s head explode, presenting everything playfully enough that plausibility isn’t a factor."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,67,"Camping it up, Jackson is hilarious."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,67,"A live-action Hammacher Schlemmer catalog of pseudo-retro novelties, spiced up with self-aware asides and over-the-top violence — slick entertainment, provided the viewer turns off whatever part of their brain is responsible for recognizing and parsing subtext."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,60,"The film never entirely figures out what it wants to do with the myth of the superspy, but at least it has fun along the way."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,60,"Never less than slick, precision-tooled multiplex entertainment, Kingsman hews close to the formula Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman established in their superficially similar ""Kick-Ass"": hyperspeed action, pithy one-liners and grotesque ultraviolence."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,58,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a modestly entertaining romp that will probably delight those who like to see a genre turned upside down so all its lunch-money lands on the ground, and purveyors of kinetic and no-holds barred gore will also get a treat."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"Director Matthew Vaughn’s latest film, Kingsman: The Secret Service, is an attempt at finding a balance somewhere between Austin Powers and James Bond that doesn’t quite succeed."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"On many levels, Kingsman has the makings of a sure-fire hit. Yet, this is one spy story even the most dedicated addicts of the genre would do well to miss."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"It sounds fun in theory, I guess, and there are some entertaining moments of rude irreverence here and there but the giddiness gets a bit tedious after a while."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"Mr. Firth gives his all, and then some. He’s very funny, even touching, when the material allows him to be. Yet the production, directed by Matthew Vaughn (“Kick-Ass,” “X-Men: First Class”) from a screenplay he wrote with Jane Goldman, can’t contain its centrifugal force."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"It tries to get by on charm, and like a lot of movies, and people who make that attempt, “Kingsman” does have charm — just not enough."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"As February comic book movies go, this works well enough to make you glad they didn’t cook up another “Ghost Rider.”"
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,50,"This is pitiful stuff, and, like the violence, it eats away at the blitheness for which Kingsman strives, leaving an aftertaste of desperation that the Connery of “Goldfinger,” say, would not have dreamed of bequeathing. The sadness is that Firth, alone in the film, does raise the spectre of those days, radiating a lightly amused reserve amid the havoc."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,40,"The problem is that Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn’t use violence; he squanders it."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,40,"Half amusing and half appalling, Matthew Vaughn’s shameless spy caper Kingsman: The Secret Service is ultimately done in by its own hypocrisy."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,40,"Yet for all Vaughn’s attention to stylized details, I noticed a number of obvious continuity errors throughout to which Vaughn seems blind."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,38,"Kingsman is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It’s ridiculously out of balance, and when you’re stuck in the middle, it doesn’t seem so funny."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,38,"Silly, sadistic and finally a little galling, Kingsman: The Secret Service answers the question: What would Colin Firth have been like if he'd played James Bond?"
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,25,"Kingsman: The Secret Service borrows the tone, story, characters and humor of “Kick-Ass,” only this time in a 007 world instead of Batman’s. Nearly everything it does, it does poorly: This one is “Weak-Ass.”"
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,25,"Expensive, derivative and boring as mattress ticking masquerading as designer fabric."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,25,"It's tructured in familiar, safe terms, plays for very low stakes, and appeals to no one so much as white, male teenagers with chips on their shoulders."
Kingsman: Secret Agent,7.7,128261724,20,"The more calculated Vaughn’s films are to appeal to his surprisingly rabid fan-base, the more they seem custom-built to repel everyone else."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,91,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a tremendous piece of pop entertainment, smart and engaging and featuring a home run movie star lead performance by Chris Evans."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"In his third outing as the Captain, Evans seems totally comfortable in the role. He manages to convey his character’s goodness without making him seem like a self-righteous stiff. There’s an ease in his performance, and a sense of humor that makes him very appealing."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,What it comes down to is the difference between spectacle and craftsmanship. The Winter Soldier has plenty of the former – every dollar of its estimated $170-million (U.S.) budget is onscreen – but it’s also got an intricate dramatic and thematic structure holding everything in place.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"The rare film in this genre that serves as both entry point and continuation. For a change, you can walk in cold and you won't be too lost."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier neatly and entertainingly puts into motion some big changes in the Marvel universe, while still sticking to its own charms — no easy feat, but one fit for a hero."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,88,"Co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and the team of screenwriters have fashioned a story with just the right balance of superhero fun, nods to the greater Marvel Universe and genuine dramatic tension."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,86,"The newest Marvel blockbuster-to-be boasts an array of well-cast leads and supporting characters; a crisply paced, sensible plot; and above-average dialogue. Even more importantly, every scene and every character interaction prove that the movie’s creative team truly understands the core appeal of Cap himself—the tone of not just the character, but the comic book series from which he springs."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"By far the best Part Two in the universe (not necessarily hard to achieve) it also rests at the franchise’s peak alongside Iron Man, Avengers, and its predecessor to show the viability of cinematic serials."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"This sequel is, by design, entirely absorbing and satisfying without being one whit memorable."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"The best Marvel film since ""The Avengers."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,The creators of Captain America: The Winter ­Soldier have brought off something fresh and bold.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,83,"Despite some of its more rickety story elements, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is possibly the studio's best action film and the one most able to stand on its own since the original ""Iron Man."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"This entry won't win any new converts, but anyone already invested in this series is going to have a blast."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"What makes ""The Winter Soldier"" so enjoyable, though, and what will make it so profitable, is its emotional bandwidth — all the vivid, nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,Steve and the movie still fly high through plot twists and cool stunts.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"Count Captain America: The Winter Soldier as another success in the Marvel line. Thanks to the chemistry between Evans and Johansson and a willingness to shake things up, it's more than just a placeholder between ""Avenger"" films."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"The script is solid, and the fight scenes are excellent."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"Parents, take note: For all its heart, this is a tougher, more morally complex movie than its predecessors. Young kids carrying their miniversions of Cap’s famous shield may be in for a jolt."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"This installment delivers a heavy and welcome dose of paranoia, administered between fleetly paced smackdowns."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"It may climax with an overly formulaic splurge, but The Winter Soldier benefits from an old-school-thriller tone that, for its first half at least, distinguishes it from its more obviously superheroic Marvel cousins."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"In the first movie, an injection transformed wimpy Steve Rogers into strapping Captain America; similarly, this sequel gives the flagging comic-book movie an adrenaline shot of relevance. You've got to hand it to them."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,80,"With a string of gratifying action sequences, and a breakneck pace leavened by a frequently witty script, The Winter Soldier stands alone as a solidly entertaining blockbuster."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"If we must endure yet another spring-summer cycle of comic book superheroes, this movie at least delivers the wham-bang goods (recycled though they may be)."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"It tells its own story and, unlike with ""Thor 2"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" we don't feel the absence of the rest of the team."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,An often breathlessly exciting action thriller told with humor and intelligence.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"The new film isn’t nearly as bleak as Christopher Nolan’s take on Batman (in general, Marvel seems more risk-averse when it comes to fiddling with the crown jewels), but it still creates an action-movie landscape torn between patriotic ideals and harsh post-9/11 realpolitik."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"The movie does its duty. It's a reliable commodity, delivered efficiently and well, like pizza."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is every rousing, whup-ass thing you want in an escapist adventure."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"A baggy, at times brutal conglomeration of surprisingly deep character development and aggressively percussive action, The Winter Soldier is a comic-book movie only in its provenance."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,75,"It's a heady blend, at times requiring more speechifying than throwaway pop deserves. But it keeps one guessing between ill-staged and frenetically edited fight scenes. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo handle vehicular mayhem better."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"Beneath the expensive, computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing, old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/11 world."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"It needs to seem cool enough that we want to watch it despite its obvious silliness, and viewed through that prism of canny analysis, the craftsmanship of “Winter Soldier” is first rate."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"Arriving in the middle of Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Winter Soldier is among the best of the nine films released so far—roughly on par with the first Iron Man and The Avengers—but if the film has one major flaw, it’s the obligation to serve a larger franchise that keeps taking on weight."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,"For sheer plotting and audience involvement, this is a notch above any of the other Avengers-feeding Marvel entries, the one that feels most like a real movie rather than a production line of ooh-and-ahh moments for fanboys."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,70,It’s to the credit of the Russos that they give the characters such room to breathe in a movie that easily might have been about rushing from one gargantuan setpiece to the next.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,67,"At over two hours, The Winter Soldier could have easily been trimmed by a good 20 minutes, but if it’s spectacular imagery and duplicitous goings-on that you crave, the film will not disappoint."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,67,"The Winter Soldier is probably in the upper tier of Marvel pictures in terms of quality, but ultimately proves too muddled and frantic to match the heights of ""The Avengers."""
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"The problem with Captain America: The Winter Soldier is that there's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"With his glorified Frisbee and good-guy smile, Evans is engaging, but “The Winter Soldier” might be stronger with a little less Captain and a little more America."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,63,"It’s OK for April, in other words, but not up to the higher standards of a Marvel summer blockbuster."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,60,So here's what moviegoers can trust from the Russo's Captain America: Winter Solider: They can trust it to be a brisk ride. They can trust it to be entertaining. They can expect it to be suspenseful.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,60,"You can’t help but feel disappointed that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"Given how little creative wiggle room there is in properties like The Winter Soldier, it’s a minor triumph that the Russos imprint any personality on the movie, which is less a stand-alone work than a part of an ever-expanding multimedia enterprise."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"The most memorable element of The Winter Soldier, besides Redford, is probably Scarlett Johansson, whose dryly funny Natasha at times comes perilously close to being … a well-developed female character?"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"Has the usual overlong running time, the half-hearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,"It's a product of the highest quality, but at the end of the day that's what it is: a machine-made, assembly-line product whose strengths tend to feel like items checked off a master list rather than being the result of any kind of individual creative touch."
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,50,Deeply mediocre and ultra-predictable.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,7.8,259766572,38,"Despite one or two moments of Venture Brothers-worthy fancy, the film is as by-the-numbers as any this series has ever offered."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,80,"Tombstone is incredibly entertaining. While not entirely original and not always well executed, it manages to keep your attention for the entire 130-minute duration. And let's face it, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday is what really sets it apart."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,"Tombstone remains a shamelessly entertaining movie, filled with lively turns from virtually every appropriate actor not working on the Costner version."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,"Tombstone is a tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,75,A few stirring shoot-'em-ups help relieve the logjam of cliches. Director George P. (Rambo) Cosmatos does an OK job at the O.K. Corral. But even the good stuff goes on for too long.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,70,"Kilmer makes a surprisingly effective and effete Holliday, but Russell lacks the stature for Earp - Sam Elliott as his older brother Virgil suggests a better movie. There's a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls, but mostly this is rootin', tootin' entertainment with lots of authentic facial hair."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,63,"Highly stylized fashion-wise but awkwardly unfocused in its plotlines, it aims for the western iconography of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone but never gets past its own directorial hurdles."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,63,Tombstone is a movie that wants to have it both ways. It wants to be at once traditional and morally ambiguous. The two visions don't quite harmonize.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,60,"Though apparently conceived as a revisionist Western, Tombstone falls prey to the cliches of the genre, and its last third is a muddle."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,60,"This has plenty of designer gore to go with its periodic spurts of bloodletting, and a lot of care and attention were obviously devoted to selecting locations, designing sets, and grooming handlebar mustaches. Much less attention went to making one believe that any of the events took place circa 1879, but at least the bursts of action keep coming, and most survive Cosmatos's addiction to smoldering close-ups."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,"If only director George P. Cosmatos (Rambo) knew how to do something with cliches other than throw them into the pot and stir. A preposterously inflated 135 minutes long, Tombstone plays like a three-hour rough cut that’s been trimmed down to a slightly shorter rough cut."
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,Doesn't really cut it in the Western genre.
Tombstone,7.8,56505065,50,"As much as these actors heroically struggle to focus the film, the director more successfully hacks it apart. But if you really love Westerns, despite its faults, it's got to be recommended for Kilmer's performance alone."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Although Dunkirk is not as labyrinthine as Nolan’s “Memento” (2000) or “Inception” (2010), its strike rate upon our senses is rarely in doubt, and there is a beautiful justice in watching it end, as it has to, in flames. Land, sea, air, and, finally, fire: the elements are complete, honor is salvaged, and the men who were lost scrape home."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"The surpassing accomplishment of Dunkirk is to make us feel an almost literal fusion with its story. It's not so much that we've seen a splendid movie, though we have, but as if we've been taken inside a historic event, become wholly immersed in something real and alive."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Seldom has a film so eloquently captured the craziness, brutality and arbitrariness of war. Dunkirk just might be Nolan’s masterpiece."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Technically awe-inspiring, narratively inventive and thematically complex, Dunkirk reinvigorates its genre with a war movie that is both harrowing and smart."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk isn’t comfortable to watch; it never relents or relaxes. At the same time, it’s impossible to look away from it."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Nolan maintains gut-wrenching suspense throughout by cross-cutting between the various characters and their plights. I’d go so far to say that Dunkirk could easily serve as its own master class in the art of film editing. Add to that an absolutely terrifyingly discordant score from Hans Zimmer and the result is, well, a bona fide classic."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"In Dunkirk, an astonishing evocation of a crucial event during the first year of World War II, Christopher Nolan has created something new in the annals of war films—an intimate epic."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is extraordinary not just because it’s ambitious and beautifully executed, but because Nolan, who both wrote and directed it, has put so much care into its emotional details—and has asked so much of, and trusted, his actors."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"It’s one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies — they are rare — that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,Dunkirk succeeds spectacularly both emotionally and visually.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"By minimalizing his loftier techniques and tendencies of the past with brusque pacing and grand photography, Nolan has assembled the leanest and most impassioned film of his career."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is a great movie, both an old-time inspirational war epic and at the same time very much a Christopher Nolan movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,Dunkirk is a landmark with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"The director's technical mastery finally transcends craft to become art and, as a result, this is his best film to date."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"The swift-moving, pulse-pounding Dunkirk reveals its filmmaker at his most nimble, supple, and simple."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Nolan has crafted a tight, gripping, deeply involving and unforgettable film that ranks about the best war movies of the decade."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"There may be money on the screen, but cash alone can’t guarantee this kind of pulsating, cinematic magic, delivered by a director at the height of his powers, mustering the very best at their craft."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,Nolan fully embraces the power of visual storytelling in Dunkirk.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"This is what audiences want from a Nolan movie, of course, as a master of the fantastic leaves his mark on historical events for the first time."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is a staggering feat of filmmaking, as Nolan's fans are accustomed. Van Hoytema's cinematography conveys death trap closeness even with IMAX cameras on a vast beach. Hans Zimmer again proves himself a masterfully dramatic composer, turning violins into the sound of spiraling aircraft. The performances are solid as such Nolan's vision requires, including pop star Harry Styles briefly."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Dunkirk is an impressionist masterpiece. These are not the first words you expect to see applied to a giant-budgeted summer entertainment made by one of the industry's most dependably commercial big-name directors. But this is a war film like few others, one that may employ a large and expensive canvas but that conveys the whole through isolated, brilliantly realized, often private moments more than via sheer spectacle, although that is here too."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Haunting, thrilling and emotional, Dunkirk is a prestige pic with guts and glory that demands multiple views. Especially in IMAX."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Christopher Nolan’s astonishing new film...is a work of heart-hammering intensity and grandeur that demands to be seen on the best and biggest screen within reach. But its spectacle doesn’t stop at the recreations of Second World War combat.  Like all great war films, it’s every bit as transfixing up close."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"A spare, propulsive, ever-intensifying combat thriller, Nolan's history lesson is both a rousing celebration of solidarity and the tensest beach-set film since Jaws."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"This is visceral, big-budget filmmaking that can be called Art. It’s also, hands down, the best motion picture of the year so far."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"This is a powerful, superbly crafted film with a story to tell, avoiding war porn in favour of something desolate and apocalyptic, a beachscape of shame, littered with soldiers zombified with defeat, a grimly male world with hardly any women on screen. It is Nolan’s best film so far."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,There have been countless films this summer that have engaged in endless spectacle but Dunkirk is the rare blockbuster that will leave a bruise.
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Few movies have so palpably conveyed the sheer isolation of fear, and the extent to which history is often made by people who are just trying to survive it — few movies have so vividly illustrated that one man can only do as much for his country as a country can do for one of its men."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,100,"Great directors make great movies. And with Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has made his second masterpiece, thrilling history retold, remembered and relished."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,98,"It is hard to imagine a better tribute to this victory of survival than Nolan’s spare, stunning, extraordinarily ambitious film."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,97,"It takes everything Nolan does well and everything he doesn’t, everything he fights against and everything he embraces, everything great and terrible about him, and streamlines it, focuses it, until it’s pure Nolan, straight into your veins. It’s the most Christopher Nolan film imaginable. It also might just be his best one."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,97,"Nolan has crafted a film that’s sensational in every sense of the word; it aims for both the heart and the head, to be sure, but arrives there via the central nervous system."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,95,"Dunkirk is a monumental, unconventional, and frequently stunning war movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,91,"Christopher Nolan’s terrific new film, Dunkirk, is powered by an engine of combusting contradictions: it’s at once minimalist and maximalist, cynical and dopey, a big-boy white elephant art film that is actually a lean and mean suspense set-piece machine."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,90,"Dunkirk wants us to sense what made this moment so pivotal without reducing it to an individual tale. And at that, it succeeds richly."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,90,"Let other directors play with toy soldiers and computer effects. This is big-time, old-school filmmaking. Dunkirk isn’t overdone. It’s simply done epically...But it’s also human. It has room for small acts of heroism, of kindness, of forgiveness. And for a single, simple important, timeless message of resilience: Take what comes. Do what you can. Never surrender."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Taken as a whole, Dunkirk invites comparisons to the works of Kubrick and Spielberg, but it’s neither as scalding as “Full Metal Jacket” nor as clear-eyed, as aware of war’s terrible randomness, as “Saving Private Ryan.” Instead, a streak of honest sentiment, earned under the most hellish of circumstances, courses through this movie and provides it with spine and a soul."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Although Dunkirk is technically a war film, its tone and style are those of a high-octane thriller. For his most serious-minded film to date, Christopher Nolan has employed all the weapons in his arsenal to craft something that, despite the Oscar-unfriendly July release date, will almost certainly be remembered when the Best Picture nominations are handed out."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Nolan fractures the narrative so that it loops back on itself — we see the events from the perspective of different characters and from different chronological vantage points, though the story coheres by movie’s end."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"This is a movie of vision and integrity made on an epic scale, a series of propositions dramatized with machinery, bodies, seawater and fire. It deserves to be seen and argued about. They don't make them like this anymore. Never did, really."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,88,"Dunkirk is also one of the best-scored films in recent memory, and Hans Zimmer’s music plays as important a role as any character. With shades of Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations, the melodies are glorious, yet Zimmer also creates an instrumental ticking-clock soundtrack that’s a propulsive force in the action scenes."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,80,"It is engaging, it is intense, it is beautifully shot and it thrusts viewers credibly into the horrifying action from the very first frame -- and doesn't relent until the very last. This being Nolan, he also overcomplicates what is essentially a fairly simple story."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,80,"The action is the attraction. If that means some of the film feels a little distant and chilly, it’s in the admirable service of avoiding simplistic drama or easy sentiment."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,75,"It’s a gripping addition to the canon of war on film that is definitely worthy of attention, and some of the images are electrifying."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,75,"Dunkirk satisfies as a brisk, gripping survival story. At only 107 minutes, it’s also astonishingly short in an era when most movies needlessly run on long beyond the two-hour mark."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,75,"With a bare minimum of dialogue, and a brutal maximum of scenes depicting near-drowning situations in and around Dunkirk, France, in late May and early June 1940, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk is a unique waterboarding of a film experience."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,70,"With tighter scripting, this’d be a masterpiece. As is? Christopher Nolan has produced a damn-fine picture that goes against most of what his catalog has become renowned for in a good, streamlined way."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,70,"What Nolan plus IMAX can do is go big. Spitfire swerving, boat tippings, men dropping to the sand as planes scream by — it doesn’t get any better. That first shot of men on a street in a shower of paper on which their deaths are foretold — brilliant. Somewhere inside the mess that is Dunkirk is a terrific linear movie."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,70,"Dunkirk would have been even better, though, if any of the characters seemed as fully realized as the aerial and naval warfare. Without that, it works best as pure sensory experience; incredible visuals, intense battles. In the rare quiet moments, we’re invited to observe an unusual instrument featured in Hans Zimmer’s score: The ticking of a clock, a reminder that while Nolan can change the march of time, his heroes cannot."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,67,"Dunkirk, with its scaled-to-be-a-masterpiece visual grandiosity, aims to be an epic of the spirit, but there is something weirdly underpowered about it. It’s a series of riveting tableaux, but the human center is lacking."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,67,"A constant movement unmoored from all but the present moment (however porously “present” is defined here) pushes Nolan forward as a visual stylist and suspense-crafter — lots of portent in the images of armies and crafts, plenty of faith in his actors to look concerned or outright distressed — as it stalls out Dunkirk in most other respects."
Dunkirk,7.9,188373161,38,"In devoting so much time to the dull, counterproductive mechanics of the action assembly, Dunkirk dispenses with nearly all other elements of drama."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,It’s impossible to envision a sequel with pleasure – this kind of lightning wouldn’t strike twice – but the first one could hardly be improved.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"Compared to Deadpool, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a bastion of sobriety and good taste."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"Smart, sexy and outrageous, Deadpool delivers."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"It’s a voraciously self-aware comedy, one that dines out on the inherent inanity of its own premise as much as it does the movies it’s competing with."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,88,"Deadpool is one of those movies that’s all the more successful for how easily it could have gone so very wrong. It’s suffused with an arch, self-aware wit...yet it takes its romance and revenge storylines just seriously enough to keep us engaged."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,83,"It is almost preposterous how little ""plot"" there is in the film...What it has in spades is attitude, and right up until the moment the film began, I was afraid It was going to be so juvenile and filthy that I would end up annoyed by it. Instead, from the very beginning of the opening credits, it is clear that director Tim Miller and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have crafted something deeply silly that isn't remotely interested in playing by the conventional rules of what we've come to think of as ""the superhero genre."""
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"It takes a strong stomach for extreme violence and over-the-top obscenity, but if you're willing to roll with that, Deadpool is a hoot."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"What sets Deadpool apart is its overall genre-busting tone, which blends a wealth of meta humor, the wisecracking Reynolds' significant skills with a one-liner, and a genuinely funny script that isn't afraid to offend anyone."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,Deadpool is neurotic and needy – and very entertaining. An innocent pleasure.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"Loud, lewd, inventive and outrageous, Deadpool is a delight. All credit to Reynolds and co. for having the steel balls to go this far."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"It takes a little while to get in gear — or perhaps just to adjust to what's going on here — but once it does, Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos, as well as the first Marvel film to irreverently trash the brand."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,80,"As a vehicle for the impudent comic stylings of Ryan Reynolds, this cheerfully demented origin story is many, many cuts above “Green Lantern,” and as a sly demolition job on the superhero movie, it sure as hell beats “Kick-Ass.”"
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,78,"Loaded with sass, sex, and sadistic violence, Deadpool is not your youngster’s comic-book origin story. Deadpool earns every bit of its R rating, a quality that’s sure to appeal to fans weary of the macho, apple-pie-eating, altruistic superheroes who buck for attention in the comic-book stables."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"It's also violent to point of sadism, explicit both visually and in terms of language. A potty-mouthed splatterfest, in fact — but a funny one."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"This movie's junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,First-time feature director Tim Miller has created a work that’s both aggressive and not aggressive enough.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"Deadpool is, on the whole, a big bowl of fun filled with great stunts, gory fight scenes, and sexy poses."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"They even make the requisite cameo by Marvel founding father Stan Lee feel profanely inspired. Not your usual Marvel superhero scene? In this case, that’s a good thing."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"Maximally cheeky. Perversely potty-mouthed. Riotously funny. Insanely violent. Uneven as all get out. And fun, fun, fun."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"Deadpool's flawed insolence is appealing, like a mangy pup crawling into your lap."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,There are more funny lines and opening credit sight gags in this than most comedies have in their full running time.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,75,"It doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story. What it has is the balls to mess with the formula and have some naughty, hard-R fun. It’s a superhero film for the wiseasses shooting spitballs in the back of the school bus."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,72,"This humor could be profoundly ugly, given how it's aimed at reducing other people's grotesque deaths to punchlines. But first-time director Tim Miller keeps the tone light — in his hands, Deadpool is more a snickering, naughty nut than an authentic sociopath."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,"Deadpool is a send-up of Marvel movies but in no way a takedown of them. It’s not subversive — it’s meant to elasticize and enhance the superhero genre, to flatter the audience for being hip enough to get all of those in-jokes."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,"It’s no surprise that the teams hired to bring a property like Deadpool to the screen know how to keep the machine oiled and humming; it’s the ones who somehow manage to temporarily stick a wrench in the works, adding something human — a feeling instead of another quip — who are worth your attention."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,Deadpool might even stand as one of the strongest and most inventive films of the high-early-late superhero baroque — if we could just turn off its built-in commentary track.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,70,"More often than not, Deadpool’s bratty energy feels liberating, allowing for a sexier, dirtier, more hilarious superhero movie than the typical all-ages Marvel affair, which is so concerned with maximising profits that it risks offending no one."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,67,"The eccentric touches—a Wham! musical cue, a dash of screwball body horror—are just accents on a stealth franchise extension. At a certain point, you have to do more than just recognize and point out the mold. You have to actually shatter it."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,67,"As is often the case with such violence, it eventually becomes numbing. By its midpoint, once the novelty of a superhero movie showing super levels of violence wears off, the thinness and lack of spark in the fight scenes becomes more readily apparent. By the film's end, they are hard to distinguish from any other superhero fare. Similarly, lack of imagination keep the film's prodigious swearing and occasional nudity from feeling like anything original."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,"For grown-ups, however, Deadpool avoids enough pitfalls to both embrace and flambé the superhero genre while also finding time for romance, doling out equal handfuls of bullets, barbs and warm fuzzies."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,The movie's far from dull. But first-time feature director Tim Miller's film serves as critique as well an example of what ails the superhero movie industry.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,"If only Deadpool were as clever, dark and funny as it believes itself to be."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,63,The whiplash contrasts between snideness and sincerity is deeply rooted in the main character's psychology.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"The ambition is laudable, but Tim Miller’s movie, far from seeming reckless and loose-limbed, comes across as pathologically calculated, measuring out its nastiness to the last drop."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"You're initially jazzed by his effrontery, but Deadpool, with his relentlessly glib, nothing-sacred attitude, is not an individual who wears particularly well."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,It's buckshot humor that is funny when it lands; cringe-worthy when it doesn't.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"For a film that vocally questions convention, it's perhaps a shame that Miller and co. played it so safe with a fairly cookie-cutter origin story, but it's really just there to give Reynolds ammunition to riff on. Whether the studio might be willing to push the character further into the leftfield in the future will depend on whether Deadpool warrants sequels."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"The sheer number of dick jokes will soon numb you to their impact, but this is a fun, if patchy, alternative to the glut of ‘the world is about to end unless we do something’ comic-book films."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,60,"The fourth-wall-smashing is fun in a Ferris Bueller kind of way, but it’s never pulled off with the devious panache of Blazing Saddles, let alone Funny Games or Hellzapoppin’. Since it's this stuff, rather than the ongoing thud-thud-thud of bad language and gore, that feels mould-breaking, it’s a pity Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick’s screenplay doesn’t have the courage to experiment a little more."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,58,It seems less irreverent than self-congratulatory.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,"Deadpool, intended as a spiky antidote to superhero oversaturation, ends up impaling only itself."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,It’s hard to imagine a movie much more aware of itself both as a movie and as a moment in a cultural progression of similar movies than Deadpool.
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,"It’s a remarkably straightforward origin flick, lacking in true satire of its genre, carried almost entirely by its lead. Deadpool is a fun character, but he’s still in search of a fun movie to match his larger-than-life personality."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,50,"It’s a film that desperately wants to upend the tropes of the comic book movie, but perhaps more shocking than anything that comes out of the mouth of its often obnoxious titular hero, is how blandly the picture sticks to the origin story playbook."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,40,"Bloody, shallow and oh-so-smug, Deadpool is so eager to offend that it’d almost be sweet if it wasn’t so, well, relentlessly annoying."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,40,"While Deadpool’s core audience will appreciate the way it flatters their knowledge of genre conventions with winking, cynical humor, too much of this stuff just plays like smug self-satisfaction. The movie is so impressed with itself that the viewer’s satisfaction seems completely irrelevant."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,38,"This one is a “different kind of superhero movie,” meaning even more fiercely attached to the mode of artistic expression known as “puberty.”"
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,25,"This is bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it’s just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema’s future."
Deadpool,8.0,363070709,25,"For an 11-year-old sneaking into the theater for his first R-rated movie, Deadpool could prove to be a revelatory trip. For myself, it was an exhausting, grating experience, lacking in wit and cleverness as it crumbles underneath its wall-to-wall torrent of jokes. If this represents a new stage for comic-book adaptations, the future is even more dismal than one could have imagined."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,80,"There's the fact that First Blood is a first-rate, taught action thriller."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,80,"First Blood is not the Rambo movie we initially think of when the character is mentioned. No, it’s much better than that."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,80,"Until the last twenty or thirty minutes, however, First Blood is a very good movie, well-paced, and well-acted not only by Stallone (who invests an unlikely character with great authority) but also by Crenna and Brian Dennehy, as the police chief."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"Boasting some of the best use of rugged landscape since the westerns of Anthony Mann, First Blood is an effective, if outlandish, picture that exists merely for its big-screen thrills."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"The darker tone, somber subtext, and generally non-exploitative violence allow viewers to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"The director, Ted Kotcheff, does a good job with the violence and suspense, working well with the wide-screen format, and he seems fully aware of the dark, subversive implications of the material, even if the screenplay doesn't allow him to resolve them successfully."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,75,"It's a film with a number of strengths, not the least of them its fierce, agile, hollow-eyed hero."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,70,"As a Stallone vehicle this is sleek, slick and not unexciting, but crassly castrates the David Morrell novel on which it is based."
First Blood,7.7,47212904,70,"Director Ted Kotcheff has all sorts of trouble with this mess, aside from credibility. Supposedly, the real villain here is society itself, which invented a debacle like Vietnam and must now deal with its lingering tragedies. But First Blood cops out completely on that one, not even trying to find a solution to Stallone's problems."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,83,"The triumph of a film like Upgrade, an unapologetic B-movie, is that it aims low and exceeds expectations."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,82,"Upgrade is an intense sci-fi action thriller with big ideas, incredible action and a remarkable lead performance."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"It’s still a small, silly movie and there’s nothing particularly novel or even of the moment about its technosceptic stance on machines, but as a genre exercise, it’s a fun ride."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"At its best – in a boundless chase round a hackers’ hangout, and a high-speed freeway pursuit – Upgrade is as fluid and exhilarating as anything the Wachowskis signed their names to in the days when they were brothers: the kind of nifty, sometimes nasty surprise our multiplexes sorely need."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"A retro science-fiction actioner with both brains and brawn – quite a lot of brawn, actually. Surely destined for cult status."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,"A great and grimy little screw-turner of sci-fi schlock, the kind that they truly don’t make anymore, the kind that would make Carpenter and Cameron proud."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,80,What Whannell wants most to do is torment and eventually pulverize most of the people in his narrative orbit and make you laugh while he does so.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Leigh Whannell’s new film is exactly the kind of pure trash that feels suited to spaces that are dirty, neglected, a little bit worse for wear. But this is no insult."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Without taking itself too seriously or academically, Upgrade operates with a level of remarkable rigor. This is a film that kicks ass, takes names, and has a healthy skepticism of the future without straying too far away from its B-movie, body horror ambitions."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"An irresistibly gory science-fiction melodrama, is B-movie schlock done right."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade is a movie by Leigh Whannell, who wrote “Saw,” “Insidious” and other memorable horror movies. But other than the occasional moment of stunningly gratuitous gore, it’s nothing like those films."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade is a brutish, efficient and well-executed slice of cyberpunk action horror with a silly streak."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Upgrade, Whannell’s second outing behind the camera, is yet another top-notch repair job, this time a kinetic sci-fi riff fashioned from scrap metal and human entrails, nervily updating Cronenbergian body horror for the iOS era."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,Upgrade’s sheer energy and the strength of its concept do more than enough to elevate this revenge picture into something refreshing and eminently watchable.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,75,"Whannell strikes out on his own with his first truly original concept as a writer-director...in a film whose production is as ambitious as its story is formulaic. Thankfully, the former mostly compensates for the latter, making Upgrade a genre-bending summer treat for those who don’t mind a little (okay, a lot) of blood with their popcorn."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Whannell commits to making a science fiction film plugged into the moment in which we’re living, and making grim projections of what might be around the corner."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"If Upgrade ultimately plays like a genre exercise, it’s certainly a taut, engrossing one."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Upgrade is an energetic, superficially slick, latter-day B-movie of the “but dumb” category. That is, it’s kind of like “RoboCop,” but dumb, and also like “Ex Machina,” but dumb."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Infusing its familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes with stylishly gonzo, low-budget filmmaking and inventive narrative flourishes, Upgrade proves far more entertaining than it has a right to be."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,70,"Upgrade offers memorable, legible fights, a compelling bombed-out retro-apocalyptic look and a mystery that seems obvious at the start but then keeps twisting."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,67,Upgrade is a welcome excuse to put Marshall-Green through some delightfully complex fight choreography.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Upgrade manages to entice and provoke, impress and terrify, if you let it."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Like all B-movies, this one provides moments of visceral satisfaction while ignoring nuance and (at times) logic."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"It’s a funny concept, helped by Marshall-Green’s blended look of pleasure and consternation at being the vessel for an invincibility that he enjoys but cannot control."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,Whannell is learning how forward motion can allow a filmmaker to get away with some pretty outlandish brutality. I wish the talk-dependent sequences weren’t so foreshadowed and clunky; only Gabriel transcends them.
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,63,"Upgrade is most effective when mining the comical and bizarre love-hate chemistry between Grey and Stem and pairing that singular conflict with batshit-crazy action, but the film’s follow-through is clunky and unfulfilling."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"If it sometimes lapses into genre clichés, Upgrade still delivers on the action front. Just turn your phone off before you go into the cinema, lest it gets ideas."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"The action sequences are electric; they’re grimy, choppy, and strange. But when the characters talk, the film stretches and slows to a banal cautionary tale, almost as if Whannell was making the movie as a homework assignment, having a ton of fun with the aesthetics and the fight scenes, then suddenly remembering he was supposed to incorporate some “themes.”"
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,60,"Whannell’s finite reserves of creativity have been meted out in an imbalance, going all in on world-building while giving the fight choreography and the cinematography listlessly documenting it the short shrift."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,58,"At the end of the day, it’s the action equivalent of a secondhand musical – you’ll most likely come for the dance scenes, and they’re good enough to wade through the filler."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,50,"The film isn’t a dud — it “delivers the goods” in a certain reductive, baseline action-fanboy way. Yet Upgrade is the sort of movie that thinks it’s more ingenious than it is, starting with the premise, which is a semi-catchy, semi-stupido hoot in a way that the movie couldn’t have completely intended."
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,50,"If this vaguely cyberpunk, occasionally comic Australian flick were named after its own qualities, it would have been called “Knockoff.”"
Upgrade,7.6,11871365,42,"As a movie, it’s the cinematic equivalent of paint-by-numbers: competent, attractive even, but take a single step closer and the lines peek through. There’s no need to pay money to go see Upgrade: If you select it on a plane and sleep through 60% of it, you’ve seen it in its entirety."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,88,"In the end, the filmmakers have given us one of the most fun movie-going experiences I’ve had this year. Huge kudos go to Johnson, Hart and especially Black for providing some truly entertaining performances for kids of all ages."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,80,"Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle is both a fulfilling reinvention and adventurous video game quest that’s far funnier, and unexpectedly exciting, than you could hope for from an evolved reboot with explosive fantasy character."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,80,"It’s an entertaining, engaging, colourful picture in its own right with decently-handled action-adventure set-pieces and sly comedy, detouring from the expected thrills and spills into body-hopping comedy drama."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,78,Kasdan injects this all with vigor and breezy humor.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"It’s the characters, not the convoluted plot or digital magic, that make “Welcome to the Jungle” such fun. For a high-concept Hollywood special-effects movie, that’s quite a concept indeed."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"This is a likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,The real fun of “Jumanji” lies in the casting. The towering Johnson and scrappy Hart play especially well off each other.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"A tremendous improvement over the tepid 1995 original, this quasi-sequel brings humor, fun performances, and a canny understanding of late 1990s-style video games to a party that never takes itself seriously."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"The film’s best moments show the characters bonding as teens, “Breakfast Club”-style, within their new bodies."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"The group’s thematically, comedically broad inversion of the source material is consistently entertaining, and squeezes in some nicely played character growth to boot."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"The Jumanji reboot Welcome to the Jungle is a happy surprise — a movie that turns out to be good (almost clean) fun, and is much more interested in character and comedy than special effects."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,75,"Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle is the Christmas tentpole release that aims to please and succeeds, a funny family entertainment product that subverts more expectations than it was obligated to contractually."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,70,"The movie has amusingly broad performances; good, bloodless scares (the characters die horribly — but have multiple lives); and self-empowering life lessons too bland to be specious. You could do far worse."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,70,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has a pleasant, affable spirit, and Johnson is wholly charming."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,70,"This sequel turns out to be a comedy of manners, of all things, and an agreeable one, a movie that will get you laughing and suck you in."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,70,The film's main appeal is in watching familiar actors pretend to be ordinary kids grappling with their new selves.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,70,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle brings audiences back to its classic fictional world with a fun, updated new twist on its well-worn story. So even if some of its subplots and emotional throughlines don’t quite click, the action-packed fun and humor should still make it worth your price of admission."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,67,The Jumanji sequel nobody demanded is fun. Kind of. Sort of. It’s a close call.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,67,"Fast-paced, frequently funny, and consistently entertaining."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,65,"Give Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle credit for not wholly insulting the audience’s intelligence. The entire script is centered on these cliches embracing their cliché new bodies, cocooning stereotypes inside stereotypes like nesting dolls."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,65,"The film strikes a nice balance between serviceable, not-overly-slick action scenes—we’ve come a long way from those shoddily animated monkeys—and comedy that’s actually rooted in character, rather than cheap references or stereotypes."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,63,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is reasonably clever and reasonably diverting.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,63,"Black is expectedly hilarious, but the beauty part of his performance is that, instead of exaggerating or patronizing this Instagram princess, he finds her vulnerable heart."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,60,"Welcome to the Jungle is mostly great fun, with Jack Black outrageously entertaining as a teenage girl. But we need to talk about Karen. As Ruby Roundhouse, Gillan is stuck in less clothes than one of Rihanna’s backing dancers. It’s a dig at the hypersexualization of women in video games, apparently. If so, perhaps the male director (or one of the four male writers) can explain how fixing the camera on a skimpily dressed female character makes the point."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,60,"In its present form – hyperactive, dopey, and hammered into shape like a Hollywood sitcom – it’s a passable school holiday jaunt."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,60,"One of the most pleasant surprises of this year's jam-packed holiday release schedule, and easily the season's must-see family film."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,60,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a one-joke movie, relying on the subversion of physical stereotypes, but thanks to impeccable casting and fun performances, that joke is very well-executed."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,60,"It’s a likeable film which borrows liberally from everything and everyone, and if it’s put together by numbers, well, then it is done capably enough."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,58,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is, at once, invigorated and underdeveloped, both rousing and slightly underwhelming."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,58,"The adventure rides on the charisma of the ensemble, who milk the body-switching situation for all it is worth."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,50,"In the original Jumanji, young characters are caught inside a board game come to life; in the new sequel, it's a video game they adventure within – a rigid construct of one-note humour, special-effect shenanigans, relentless quest-based action and sledge-hammered messaging."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,50,"The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,50,"With its video game upgrade, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle manages to match the silly fun of its predecessor — even without Williams — and that’s no small achievement unlocked."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,50,"Welcome to the Jungle isn’t a bad movie. It’s a diverting, mildly amusing, competent bit of big-budget studio product. And maybe those are the stakes we’re now playing for these days."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,50,"The mildly amusing Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is further proof that even the stalest whiff of brand recognition has become preferable to originality. Only part of the blame for that belongs to the studios, but after cannibalizing themselves for much of the last 20 years, Hollywood has clearly eaten their way down to the crumbs."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,45,"Kasdan isn’t known for pulling off big budget action properties. He does his best here to create a kinetic pace, but the execution is always flat and dull."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,42,"If you’re willing to lean into the movie’s complete and utter stupidity, Jumanji might just stumble through its languorous two-hour runtime on sheer charm."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,40,"It’s a lazy, thoroughly unoriginal bit of storytelling, but it has just enough cheeky humor and bass-thumping action scenes to be a potential crowd-pleaser."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,40,"The material is often weak, but the stars earn their paychecks."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,40,"The action’s passable and Gillan makes a decent fist of an underwritten character. Otherwise, this Jumanji makeover’s a losing game."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,38,"The whole affair feels corporate, cooked-up-by-committee."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,38,The film is unable to reconcile a desire to ridicule its own artifice with constant attempts to foster genuine empathy and dramatic tension.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,30,"It’s like watching the lamest Indiana Jones sequel ever imagined, minus Indiana Jones."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7.0,404515480,25,"Who’s the audience for this movie? It’s not smart, scary or funny enough for adults and older teens, and it’s inappropriate for young kids."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"While the villains are standard issue evil, Wonder Woman is remarkable in the genre for its early 20th century setting and Gadot's galvanizing performance."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"Wonder Woman is smart, slick, and satisfying in all of the ways superhero films ought to be. How deliciously ironic that in a genre where the boys seem to have all the fun, a female hero and a female director are the ones to show the fellas how it’s done."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,91,"Wonder Woman is as much about a superhero rising as it is about a world deserving of her, and Diana’s hard-won insistence on battling for humanity (no matter how frequently they disappoint) adds the kind of gravitas and emotion that establishes it as the very best film the DCEU has made yet. There’s only one word for it: wonderful."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"Caught up in the coils of Princess Diana’s hot lasso, I am bound to tell the truth: Wonder Woman is wonderful, and the Woman herself, as played by Gal Gadot, is the dazzling embodiment of female empowerment. She is also learned, charmingly funny and, for a goddess, touchingly human."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"Wonder Woman emerges as not only the strongest movie in the present DC cycle, but also the first one that feels like an enveloping, honest-to-God entertainment rather than a raging cinematic migraine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"We get it, and DC finally should, too: Superhero movies can be fun. And Wonder Woman is a movie that'd send even the Suicide Squad home smiling."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,90,"In the recent flood of superhero movies, several have managed to be quite good — but Wonder Woman ranks as one of the few great ones."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"While having a female director perhaps gives Wonder Woman a subtly different perspective, the real strengths of this production are its lead actors, the period piece setting, and an unexpected emotional resonance that one doesn’t expect from a popcorn movie."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"Diana’s a superhero without a chip on her shoulder; she was raised in love, and Gadot lets that belief shine through her eyes. You’re both drawn to this woman and in awe of her."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"Director Patty Jenkins’ origin story is packed with heart and empathy, and we have Gadot’s endearing performance to thank for that — but it’s also a byproduct of the timeline."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"A genuinely surprising film that plays with genre and throws out the now very tired superhero movie formula. It’s an action film, a romantic comedy and a coming-of-age story and a period piece and a war movie all in one. Above all, it’s a hopeful story about humanity."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,88,"For the first time in a long time, I came out of a DC comic book movie feeling ready for a sequel. It feels right, at this actual historical moment, when men made of something less than steel are bumbling around trying to run things. Paging Paradise Island!"
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,87,"Wonder Woman represents a number of delicate balancing acts: between humor and gravitas; angst and adventure; full-blown, unvarnished superhero fantasy and the DCEU’s usual unpacking of what those fantasies mean."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"At times, Wonder Woman feels like watching Splash with a shield — another babelicious naïf breaking all the rules. Yet the joke isn't on her. It's on all the men mistaking unsophistication for weakness. To be uncultured is to be mentally free; no one's put on a yoke. That's what makes Wonder Woman a knockout."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"Throughout Wonder Woman there is an earnestness in tone that plays well, and rarely as saccharine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,83,"This film is a goddamned blast. To merely call it the strongest entrant in the DC Entertainment Universe so far is to call Jaws the strongest entrant in the shark movie canon. Say what you will about Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Deep Blue Sea, but Wonder Woman is in another class altogether."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it’s necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Gadot is simply marvelous. Physically, she’s bold and commanding. But there’s a sweetness about her too, as if she and Jenkins understand intuitively that Wonder Woman can’t just be blandly awesome. She's got to be able to feel wonder too."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Its earnest insouciance recalls the “Superman” movies of the ’70s and ’80s more than the mock-Wagnerian spectacles of our own day, and like those predigital Man of Steel adventures, it gestures knowingly but reverently back to the jaunty, truth-and-justice spirit of an even older Hollywood tradition."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,This really is Wonder Woman coming to the rescue of the DC Comics universe.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Gadot is a godsend, Pine charms, and Jenkins delivers old-school thrills with heart and conviction."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"If the action in Wonder Woman comes less frequently than you might expect, it’s also thrillingly designed and staged, with a surging sense of real people, from all sorts of backgrounds, swept up in the wider conflict’s churns and jolts."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"As Diana, Gadot is excellent, a rocking electric cello riff in human form."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Wonder Woman is a gorgeous, powerful display of epic storytelling that makes me wish this was Gadot’s first chance to play Diana Prince. It’s the roaring introduction she deserves, and a hopeful shift in DC culture that hints at what’s about to come."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,80,"Wonder Woman is the first major studio superhero film directed by a woman, and it shows in a number of subtle, yet important ways."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,79,"Wonder Woman is leaps and bounds above the other three entries in the DCEU. With a dramatic setting, a few entertaining action scenes, and a strong supporting cast all working together to tell an inspirational Hero’s Journey, it more than offsets some occasionally uneven acting on Gadot’s part and some shaky technical aspects."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,78,"This, uh, wonderfully directed and near-perfectly cast iconic heroine female empowerment story is so similar in tone and feel to Marvel Studios’ ""Captain America"" that I was waiting for Stan Lee to show up, possibly as a eunuch."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Wonder Woman may not qualify as a particularly suspenseful First World War movie and it may not feature enough globe-spinning special effects to satisfy hard-core superhero fans, but it certainly is an intriguing combination of the two genres."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Pine makes a perfect foil for Gadot’s furrowed-brow sincerity, his Steve Trevor wry and comfortable enough in his skin to hold his own with Diana (even when she’s scrutinizing his naked form)."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Jenkins and her collaborators have done what I thought was previously impossible: created a Wonder Woman film that is inspiring, blistering, and compassionate, in ways that honor what has made this character an icon."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"Wonder Woman may not cure all the ills of pop culture’s superhero-saturation syndrome; in fact, in many ways it succumbs to some of its worst excesses. But at least it brings an exhilarating, vicarious kick to the sagging, bagging table."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,"The first two hours run the gamut from interesting to delightful. The final 20 minutes are roaring, ridiculous business as usual. We should be thankful the tide of mediocrity is held back as long as it is."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,75,Wonder Woman achieves touching and powerful moments that are unusual for a movie of this kind.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,72,"Wonder Woman won’t reinvent the superhero franchise, or the origin story. But it does show how compelling they can still be, when someone is allowed to do them right."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,The violence and fights in Wonder Woman are intriguing not just because they’re stunning but also because of how emotional they are.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Gadot is terrific, capturing perfectly the grace, power and heroism of the Amazonian princess who must make herself present in the world to save it."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Though the action...sometimes has a slightly distracting video game feel, it’s often stirring stuff, and it’s skillfully integrated into the developing relationship between the title character and her mortal man."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"Wonder Woman is exciting, romantic, funny — and my favorite DC Extended Universe movie to date. With her courage and strength, Diana sets an example for everyone she meets, and she holds fast to her ideals even under great pressure. With any luck, she’ll provide similar inspiration to the directors of the DC Extended Universe in the years ahead."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,70,"As with all comics-based extravaganzas, brevity is anathema to the Patty Jenkins-directed Wonder Woman, and it doesn’t quite transcend the traits of franchise product as it checks off the list of action-fantasy requisites."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,67,The best parts of Wonder Woman are frivolous in the best way.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,67,"The best thing about Wonder Woman, the overlong and intermittently enjoyable new DC superhero spectacular, is Wonder Woman herself."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"Gadot proves she is worthy of Wonder Woman’s tiara, but the superhero deserves a great film, not one that’s just better than the others."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"Wonder Woman is a strong, at times even rousing, application of the superhero film formula, but it ultimately can’t transcend the constraints of the genre."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,"The movie is a derivative hash of comic book picture plot points and origin story touchstones — half “Captain America: The First Avenger,” half “Thor.” But director Patty Jenkins, who did not get enough credit for “Monster,” keeps Gadot in frame and the tone light."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,63,The star is unstoppable and spectacular to see in motion. Watch her fly.
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,60,"Wonder Woman is not a great film, nor is it the feminist glass ceiling-smasher that many had hoped for. But after the offensively stupid Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman feels nothing short of revelatory."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,60,"The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,58,"Yes, it’s the DCEU’s best film, but as we know, that’s not saying a lot. But, hey, that terrific second act that we should cling to even if it’s a distant memory by the time love defeats aggression. “Wonder Woman” might be molded by the mighty Gods, but as shaped by mere mortals her mettle and beliefs and can be only so wonderfully divine."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,50,"When the separatist compound must accommodate an interloper — Steve Trevor, fished out of the sea by Diana after his plane goes down — any hopes that Wonder Woman will sustain its appealing misandry are soon dashed."
Wonder Woman,7.5,412563408,40,"It’s plagued by the same problems that dragged down previous visits to the DC movie world: over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot. What promised to be a glass-ceiling-smashing blockbuster actually looks more like a future camp classic."
Léon,8.6,19501238,91,"Ah, monsieur, you can lead a Frenchman to the Big Apple, but you can't make him a New Yorker -- and that's exactly what makes The Professional so fascinating."
Léon,8.6,19501238,90,"Oldman is the least inhibited actor of his generation, and as this deranged detective, he keeps absolutely nothing in reserve."
Léon,8.6,19501238,80,Few action films can claim such complexities without conceding the bang-bang stuff that brings in the big money.
Léon,8.6,19501238,78,"Besson's visuals are, as always, vibrant and decidedly European. He fills the frames with odd-angled shots and alarming riots of color that catch you off-balance."
Léon,8.6,19501238,75,"With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed."
Léon,8.6,19501238,70,Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style.
Léon,8.6,19501238,63,"Takes its viewers on a bouncing high-wire act between intense violence and sugar-sweet tenderness, with some light-hearted comedy along the way."
Léon,8.6,19501238,63,"Widescreen lensing favors tight close-ups, and multiple shoot-'em-ups are edited with panache."
Léon,8.6,19501238,60,"The sheer oddness of the New York world constructed for this film--where cops and crooks are literally interchangeable, and Oldman and Danny Aiello are stranded in roles that pick over the leavings of earlier parts--ultimately seems at once too deranged and too mechanical."
Léon,8.6,19501238,50,"Luc Besson is a masterly director of stylish, thrilling, and humorous action set pieces, and this film's bravura opening and closing sequences are two of the year's best."
Léon,8.6,19501238,50,"Lacks the sexy elan of ""La Femme Nikita"" and suffers from infinitely worse culture shock. [18 Nov 1994, p.C18]"
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,85,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is as cheeky, cartoonish, and crazy as its predecessor, but it’s also commendably unafraid to demolish what had come before it if it’s in service of the story. The new dynamic between Eggsy and his team is great, and the Statesman prove amusing counterparts to these gentlemen spies from across the pond."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,80,"As ultraviolent as the first film, and as ultrasmutty, The Golden Circle will leave the Kingsfans grinning, even if its characters have less growing to do this time around."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,75,"With its inventively nutso action, youthful vibe, and subversive topicality, the “Kingsman” franchise feels more relevant than even Daniel Craig’s James Bond. Screen espionage doesn’t come any hipper these days."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,70,"The movie is too long, too violent, too silly—too everything. Yet for those who enjoyed the original Kingsman, it is a more than adequate second act. To put it another way: first time satire, second time farce."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,70,"This fleet-footed, glibly imaginative international romp stays on its toes and keeps its wits about it most of the time, with entertaining and pointedly U.S.-friendly cast additions."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"Like its predecessor, everything about the stylized Kingsman: The Golden Circle teeters just a little over the top: the elegant international production values, the perfectly tailored Savile Row attire, the hyperviolent action sequences, the depiction of something more than just an innocent hint of sex."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"Vaughn’s film is overflowing with big set pieces, but all those epic action sequences amount to a running time clocking nearly two and a half hours – and not much else. Like fireworks, they’re awe-inspiring while you’re watching, but there’s little left to marvel at after the show’s over."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,67,"It’s fun, but it’s blockbuster overkill after an already-crowded summer season."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"“Kingsman” is essentially a live-action cartoon, one that aims for an audible reaction and little else. That may not be the world’s loftiest goal, but whether it results in a gagging eww or a chuckle, it’s a plan that usually succeeds."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"True Kingsman fans will appreciate that director Matthew Vaughn reacted to digs at ""The Secret Service"" for being gratuitously violent, sexually adolescent and politically reactionary by laying all of it on three times thicker."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,There’s fun to be had but it’s not consistent and at times it’s disappointing how certain scenes play out.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"The movie needs an editor, or a bartender, to remind the director when he’s hit the two-hour mark: Last orders, Mr. Vaughn."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,63,"Sequelitis has Vaughn in its grip. The follow-up to his 2014 hyperviolent, boundlessly inventive spy-movie sendup gives the impression it’s trying a little too hard to surpass its predecessor."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,It’s a film so cartoonishly outsized that it almost renders the first film restrained by comparison
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"The movie has its moments, but the bloat and the blandness take their toll."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"Fun, fleeting entertainment if you’re after more of the same, but fails to carve out any fresh ground."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,This isn’t quite solid-gold filmmaking. But it might be gold-plated.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,60,"Vaughn sticks to what he knows with his Kingsman sequel but rarely ups the ante, making this a fun-enough entry into an already-too-familiar franchise."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,55,"The Golden Circle isn’t strong on brains or heart, but it has no shortage of guts."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,51,"For all its supposed irreverence, the movie feels product-tested to the moon; there isn’t a single shot that isn’t trying to sell you something. The movie also has some of the creeping bro grossness of some of Vaughn’s other films."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"Just like the first movie, the film’s politics are all over the place in a way that should be fun but ends up feeling distracting. Yet it’s hard to hate this movie too much. It has a weird generosity toward its audience. It keeps giving and giving and giving, until you’re overstuffed. It’s a Thanksgiving feast movie, where you’re vaguely impressed at all of the effort, even if the individual elements leave something to be desired."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"A wild, reckless, gleefully immoral work of pop nihilism."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"Dumber and less stylish than its predecessor, Kingsman: The Secret Service, the cartoonish secret-agent pastiche Kingsman: The Golden Circle is also even more of an incoherent right-wing text, an exaggeration of the James Bond movies’ violence, fashion sense, and sex that keeps trying to pass off its ham-fisted conservative attitudes as smirking nihilism."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"In a movie as happy to resurrect characters as rub them out, nothing is of consequence, and the glibness grows numbing."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"It’s a big, vulgar, Saturday morning cartoon of a film, to both its benefit and detriment."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,50,"It is all aggressively stylized, abusively fast-paced and ear-bleedingly loud, relying so heavily on CGI that nothing — not one thing — seems to correspond to the real world."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,42,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a tarnished sequel demolishing the original's balderdash charm in tumble-dry camera moves, CGI slosh and Elton John f-bombs."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,42,"If the first Kingsman, at its best, felt like a dry martini of a joke, then this one is more Jack and Mountain Dew — unsubtle, unrefreshing, and unnecessary."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"Vaughn hasn’t only run out of things to say but people to hate, and without that underlying aggression, the movie feels like it’s just going through the motions. Better luck next time, bruv."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"There’s plenty of action—and laughs here and there—but when a repeated cameo from Elton John is the best thing in a movie like this, you know you’re in trouble."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"It pulls off the impressive feat of feeling both hyperactive and lazy. This is hardly the first time a major Hollywood franchise has succumbed to narrative flabbiness, or invested in grand, elaborate world building with the kind of devotion that far outstrips the viewer’s interest."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a movie in search of a reason to exist. Despite a needlessly excessive running time, it never finds one."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,40,"As kinetic as its predecessor — and just as belaboured — Kingsman: The Golden Circle serves up another batch of hyper-stylised action, irreverent humour and sharp threads, resulting in a film that’s not nearly as cool as it thinks it is."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle offers everything — several bored Oscar winners, two scenes featuring death by meat grinder, Elton John mugging in close-up — except a good time."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,"If you liked the original, the best way to preserve that memory is to stay away from this sequel."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,38,The hollow grandeur of the film's action only gives the proceedings a glib undertone that also undermines the rare occasions of earnestness that the heroes exhibit toward fallen comrades.
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,30,"Unfortunately, overkill is the order of the day — and it takes a toll. There are too many supporting characters, too much exposition, too many gadgets, too many “Matrix”-inspired, slow-motion fight sequences, too many plot holes instead of twists and too ham-handed a political message about the war on drugs."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,30,"Bloated, inexplicably un-entertaining."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,25,"Despite all the mayhem, “The Golden Circle” often feels slow and belabored, particularly in its middle section, when inspiration is nowhere to be found, and the chaos seems to be there just for the sake of being there."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,25,"That’s what Kingsman: The Golden Circle is like — recycled Bond gags and settings, sophomoric humor, and maybe an hour of dead time scattered throughout a two hour and fifteen minute mess."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,20,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the bloated, campy, thoroughly stupid sequel to the 2014 action thriller ""Kingsman: The Secret Service."""
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,20,"This crazily overlong and tiresome follow-up...doesn’t seem to have the first idea what to do with itself – not least when it comes to its much-vaunted all-star cast, the majority of whom are barely even in it."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,16,"Taken on it’s own merits — or lack thereof – Kingsman: The Golden Circle feels like being trapped in a dorm room, while a bunch of frat bros watch the first Kingsman and tell you it’s the greatest movie ever made."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,6.8,100234838,0,"It’s violence for cowardly voyeurs who want to make the people who annoy them just shut up in a way that’s silent, sterile, and thoroughly humiliating to the victim."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,91,"Iron Man 3 is an ominously exciting, shoot-the-works comic-book spectacular."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,88,"Thanks to Downey’s genius, Iron Man 3 is equally terrific, whether Tony’s fending off an army of villains or bantering with a kid in a shed on a cold, snowy night."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,88,"A madly creative, darkly comical, and fiendishly self-aware actioner with muscle to spare."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,83,"Downey, Jr. remains a rightfully cherished smartass figure, having as much a ball with Black’s one-liners as he had in “KKBB,” and he sells Tony’s newfound post-traumatic vulnerability more credibly than the film does."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Besides rehabbing a hero who overcomes anxiety to save the world and defeat the terror-industrial complex by the simple matter of cloning his body armor, the movie proves that there’s still intelligent life on Planet Marvel. As you’re propelled out of the theater on IM3′s hydraulic lift of pleasures, you’re likely to say, “That is how it’s done.”"
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,It sharply fuses the humor and heart of the earlier films with a satisfyingly heavy-metal strength — and a darkness that’s more than earned.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Funny, twisty and thrilling, this is shellhead’s most entertaining solo flight to date. It’s also an impressive pace-setter for this summer’s barrage of big movies."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Black proves the perfect blacksmith, forging smart new tech and scenarios for the swaggering super-genius. If this does turn out to be Downey Jr.’s final solo outing, it’s a very strong exit."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Black and his co-screenwriter, first-timer Drew Pearce, have great fun reshuffling the deck, teasing about who might occupy what superhero suit and morphing the story along with identity revelations and expansions of the dramatic horizons; the well-chosen cast members respond in kind with virtually palpable glee."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,Black has an instinctive feel for balancing action set-pieces against the passages of soap-opera that are required to make them matter.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,80,"Iron Man 3 is smart, funny and spectacular."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"The balance between human interaction and mechanical mayhem works well until the end, when flying suits and exploding bodies fill the screen."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"It's solidly entertaining, with Downey's roguish charm as appealing as ever."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"The rambunctious Iron Man 3 is a briskly paced thrill ride until about 90 minutes in, when the excitement wanes. A few late-breaking surprises re-invigorate the tale, however."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"Iron Man 3 has the stuff to please the devotees and divert everyone else, which is pretty much what's expected from the curtain-raiser of any summer season."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,75,"For all the film's flaws, Black brings enough to the table that it's far from a chore, and if this level of ingenuity and surprise can be maintained, there'll be no need for Tony to hang up his Iron Man helmet any time soon."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"At least this time ""Goopy"" Paltrow gets to perform a few superheroics herself, along with enduring some heavy-duty torture that’s bound to please her haters — for whom the sight of the top of her face being peeled off in ""Contagion"" was like Christmas in July."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"As far as bored and cynical, playing-out-the-string comic-book action sequels go – hey, Iron Man 3 is a pretty good one!"
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,70,"Downey is as funny as ever, if not more so. He ensures that Iron Man 3 is a solid installment in the franchise, and helps to make it seem, at least for a time, that it might be something more."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,67,"Iron Man 3 is missing that old Tony Stark spark. Not from Robert Downey Jr., who is still the best thing about this overblown show."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"Iron Man 3 builds on the first film's political cynicism by suggesting that politicians and arms dealers dream up foreign policy crises to consolidate power and make money, but it doesn't develop this notion in detail, because if it did, the audience would tune out."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"The real question for audiences isn’t whether Tony Stark/Iron Man defeats the latest supervillain (of course he does), but whether the movie itself rises above the dreaded third-in-a-sequel torpor of ""Spider-Man"" and ""The Dark Knight."" Spoiler alert: Yes, mostly, it does."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"A big, kabooming sequel that plays sleight-of-hand with its audience."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"For all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"Marvel Studios will only be able to draw from this well only so many times, though, before fatigue sets in."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,The best scenes are when Stark just cuts impatiently through the claptrap.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"It's not without its payoffs; I enjoyed a lot of it. But overall last year's ""Avengers"" delivered the bombastic goods more efficiently than this year's Marvel."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,63,"The broad, goofy jokes and one-liners land — even if they feel a little winded, this time."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,60,"In other words, Iron Man 3 -- once more delivering a satisfying combination of humor, action and dazzling set pieces -- provides everything fans of the franchise expect."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,60,"Given the keys to the franchise and a role in the writing, Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. “I’m a mechanic,” Stark says to the boy in a moment of self-doubt. That’s 100% Black, that line, a tidy code of craft, and the jitters pass."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,60,It’s undeniably entertaining – and worth seeing for Kingsley alone – with the misfires never fully overshadowing the moments of glory.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,58,"Here, it’s hard not to wish Downey were sparring with his costumed comrades again, instead of trading barbs with the far-less-colorful cast members — old and new — of this busy, sporadically diverting sequel."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"The action, directed by Shane Black, ranges from passable to interminable. The plot goes from clang to bang. Downey Jr. is still the best thing about this series."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,The third iteration of a franchise that began so well becomes a hollow hymn to martial gadgetry. The suits and story clank in unison.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"A frantic, occasionally funny, finally enervating bricolage of special effects, explosive set pieces, sardonic one--liners and notional human emotions, this branch of the Marvel franchise tree feels brittle and over--extended enough to snap off entirely."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"Unfortunately, that sharp-eyed domestic comedy is dwarfed by the far less well-written supervillain crime plot that surrounds it."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"Judged solely in comparison to its corporate cousins, Iron Man 3 is a defective model. It’s lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"The film provides more of the same and nothing startlingly innovative, but what's here is good."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"The big problems with Iron Man 3 are less specific to the movie itself than they are characteristic of the hypermalaise that’s infected so many current mega-blockbusters—too much plot, too much action, too many characters, too many pseudo-feelings."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,"Iron Man 3 is more perfunctory and workmanlike than its two predecessors, but this solid production still delivers more than enough of what fans expect."
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,50,Stuff blows up and then more stuff blows up because that’s what happens when diversions like this hit movie screens around this time of year: chaos reigns and then some guy cleans it up.
Iron Man Three,7.2,409013994,40,"The villains are all wrong, the motivations are muddy, even the gadgetry is off. And the swaggering genius at the center of it all has become a preening fool."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, The Dark Knight Rises is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself – as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"The conclusion of Christopher Nolan's superhero trilogy is a hugely ambitious mix of eye candy and brain food. If it doesn't have the haunting aftertaste of the previous serving, that's only because Nolan couldn't clone Heath Ledger. But beefy substitute Tom Hardy is a hell of a villain."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"If The Dark Knight Rises is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen. It's an unfriendly masterpiece that shows you only a little circle of daylight, way up there at the top of our collective prison shaft - but a masterpiece nonetheless."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"Potent, persuasive and hypnotic, The Dark Knight Rises has us at its mercy. A disturbing experience we live through as much as a film we watch, this dazzling conclusion to director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"This is not the sort of movie you can just leave behind in the theater. And like any true finale to a trilogy, the picture doesn't work nearly as well if you haven't seen the previous two installments: It's not designed to stand alone, and it pays off all that has come before with an exuberant, thrilling high."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,Christopher Nolan's dramatically and emotionally satisfying wrap-up to the Dark Knight trilogy adroitly avoids clichés and gleefully subverts your expectations at every turn.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"""The Avengers"" is kid stuff compared with this meditation on mortal loss and heroic frailty. For once a melodrama with pulp origins convinces viewers that it can be the modern equivalent to Greek myths or a Jonathan Swift satire. TDKR is that big, that bitter - a film of grand ambitions and epic achievement. The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"With spectacle in abundance and sexiness in (supporting) parts, this is superhero filmmaking on an unprecedented scale. Rises may lack the surprise of Begins or the anarchy of Knight, but it makes up for that in pure emotion."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"A smart, stirring spectacle that faces down impossible expectations to pull off a hugely satisfying end to business."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,100,"Makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish. Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined, as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolan's trio, even if it lacks -- how could it not? -- an element as unique as Heath Ledger's immortal turn in The Dark Knight. It's a blockbuster by any standard."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,91,The miracle of Nolan's Batman trilogy is the way it imprints those myths with the dread-soaked tenor of the times.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,90,"While The Dark Knight Rises raises the dramatic stakes considerably, at least in terms of its potential body count, it doesn't have its predecessor's breathless sense of menace or its demonic showmanship, and with the exception of one audacious sleight-of-hand twist, the story can at times seem more complicated than intricate."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"Nolan brings his Batman trilogy to a close with a majestic, almost completely satisfying crash. Everything feels epic about the film: the characters, the effects, the emotional stakes - even the missteps (and there are more than a few)."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"It's not only packed with high-toned classical and contemporary cultural allusions, but manages to wear its popcorn inspirations on its sleeve."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"Most important, does The Dark Knight Rises achieve the impossible, which is to bring a cherished cinematic chapter to a close, yet manage to leave fans feeling not desolate but cheered? To that all-important question, the answer is an unequivocal yes."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,"The Dark Knight Rises ultimately justifies its length (in fact, a good argument could be made for a longer cut) and the last 45 minutes is nothing short of spectacular. From the point where the narrative takes a leap of faith, it never lets up."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,88,The sheer scope of Nolan's vision – with emotion and spectacle thundering across the screen – is staggering. The Dark Knight Rises is the King Daddy of summer movie epics.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,85,"As you might expect from the creator of ""Inception"" and ""Memento,"" there are surprises both in the story and in the storytelling. But the biggest surprise may just be how satisfying Nolan has made his farewell to a Dark Knight trilogy that many fans will wish he'd extend to a 10-part series, at least."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"Believable and preposterous, effective as a closing chapter and somewhat of a letdown if only because Mr. Nolan, who continues to refine his cinematic technique, hasn't surmounted ""The Dark Knight"" or coaxed forth another performance as mesmerizingly vital as Heath Ledger's Joker in that film."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"While director Christopher Nolan and star Christian Bale's epic of criminality and all-consuming conviction ultimately falls a bit short - missing, for instance, a villainous face a la Heath Ledger's Joker - their Batman trilogy ends with a suitably thrilling mix of guts and glory."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"The Dark Knight Rises brings the Batman story to a close in enormous, satisfying fashion, not just on the huge scale it builds for itself, but on a human level as well."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"It's spectacular, to be sure, but also remarkable for its all-encompassing gloom. No movie has ever administered more punishment, to its hero or its audience, in the name of mainstream entertainment."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,80,"The Dark Knight Rises may be a hammy, portentous affair but Nolan directs it with aplomb. He takes these cod-heroic, costumed elements and whisks them into a tale of heavy-metal fury, full of pain and toil, surging uphill, across the flyovers, in search of a climax."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,78,"I said once before that every generation gets the superhero it deserves, and Nolan's darkest of dark knights is surely ours – and no more so than in this current incarnation. (Granted, this doesn't bode well for society, but hey, things are bleak all over.)"
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The Dark Knight aspires to the epic and reaches it on a number of impressive and less impressive levels. That it is a frequently, unnervingly glorious triumph of brawn over brains is not despite but in spite of Nolan's admirably stubborn - if persistently, risibly serious - insistence that the modern superhero can have it all."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"Director Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script with brother Jonathan, gets so many of the big things right that I wished they had taken more time with the little ones."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The Dark Knight Rises is reasonably accomplished as a gigantic superhero movie; as a meditation on capital and its personal and social discontents, it's strictly from the funny pages."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"While it's the most ambitious of the three films, it's not as mesmerizing as 2008's ""The Dark Knight."" The plot is occasionally murky, its archvillain lacks charismatic menace, and the last hour is belabored."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"If you just give yourself over to Nolan's sweeping, symphonic Cowled Crusader saga, The Dark Knight Rises is, well, a blast."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,Christopher Nolan's capper of his Batman trilogy is a summer blockbuster of grand inclinations in both form and content.
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"The Dark Knight Rises declares its importance with each scene but seldom backs up the claims. It is a climax more fitful than fulfilling, solemn to a fault and begging the Joker's question: ""Why so serious?"""
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"Chaos reigns for much of The Dark Knight Rises, often in big, beautiful, IMAX-size scenes that only Nolan could have conceived. Yet when the apocalyptic dust literally settles on this concluding chapter, the character who lingers longest in memory is an average Gotham City cop named John Blake, wonderfully played with human-scale clarity by Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,75,"A spectacular noir epic that's equal parts murky, bloated, flashy and triumphantly cinematic. Four years after Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" sequel ""The Dark Knight"" rattled audiences with a similar audiovisual overload, the new movie falls into the same rhythm and remains viscerally satisfying even when the story falters."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,70,"Christopher Nolan, for all his visionary flair, wants to suck the comic out of comic books; Anne Hathaway wants to put it back in. Take your pick."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,70,"A fine film in a strong summer, but it lacks the spark that made its immediate predecessor a masterpiece."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,63,"Now comes The Dark Knight Rises, which makes ""The Dark Knight"" look like ""Dora the Explorer"" and is more of a 164-minute anxiety disorder than a movie."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,60,"Doesn't rise as much as it flounders and frustrates, in what would appear to be a case of a filmmaker prioritizing ego over efficiency, and engaging in generally muddled storytelling."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,60,"Grand scale or no, this feels like a blockbuster on autopilot more often than not, curiously detached and self-importantly somber even by the director's standards - and without the cerebral heft of his best work."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,58,"Were it not for Anne Hathaway's Catwoman-ish Selina Kyle, there wouldn't be a single character in ""Rises"" who cracks a smile. I'm not arguing that ""Rises"" should be ""Singin' in the Rain."" But its Wagnerian ambitions are not matched by its material. It hasn't earned its darkness."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,50,"Moments are stretched. Every recollection must be illustrated by a flashback. Character motivations shift on a dime, and if you understand even half of what's going on - not generally, but specifically - you'll be doing better than most."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,40,"At over two hours and forty minutes long, with repeated scenes of bone-crunching violence and a maddeningly unrelenting percussive score by Hans Zimmer, The Dark Knight Rises is something of an ordeal to sit through."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,40,"The Dark Knight Rises is a shallow repository of ideas, but as a work of sheer sensation, it has something to recommend."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,30,"The script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, takes a few vague pokes at Wall Street and the financial elite but mainly revives the ponderous psychodrama of the first movie."
Dakeu naiteu raijeu,8.4,448139099,25,"Halfheartedly, I give The Dark Knight Rises - the third and final Batflick in the Nolan trilogy - one star for eardrum-busting sound effects and glaucoma-inducing computerized images in blinding Imax, but talk about stretching things."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,88,"Jurassic World is pure, dumb, wall-to-wall fun. When they hand you your 3-D glasses, you can check your brain at the door and pick it up on your way out."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,83,"Trevorrow hits all the right, respectful beats, as a protege should; you can sense a desire to please his mentor, with several amusing references to Spielberg's 1993 original, and a climactic, triumphant nod to another of his works."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,83,"Jurassic World is a blockbuster of its moment. It’s not deep. There aren’t new lessons to be learned. And the film’s flesh-and-blood actors are basically glamorized extras. But when it comes to serving up a smorgasbord of bloody dino mayhem, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do beautifully."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,83,"Jurassic World takes the sensibilities of Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park,” the sense of wonder, the awe, the thrills, and transports them into the 21st century with ease, plausibility and storytelling clarity."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,80,"Whatever else you say about Jurassic World, its amazing special effects — not just hurtling dinosaurs but flying killer pterodactyls — make it one of the most rousing people-running-away-from-stuff movies ever made. At its best, it’s good enough to take your mind off its worst, which is saying a lot."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,80,"From Pteranodon's dive-fishing to Raptors pack-hunting, Jurassic World is in its element when it's using its assets, and though they can't recreate that awe of twenty-two years ago, this is finally a sequel worthy of the title."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,80,"Jurassic World is fresh and thrilling, and while it often tips its hat to the original, it’s not a slavish copy, introducing more than enough new wrinkles into the prehistoric playbook to launch a new wave of sequels."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,80,"A terrifically enjoyable and exciting summer spectacular: savvy, funny, ridiculous in just the right way, with some smart imaginative twists."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,80,"Jurassic World is a fiendishly crafted blockbuster: old-fashioned thrills, heroism and romance, locked inside a smart, self-aware shell."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,80,"Two decades after dinosaurs ruled the Earth’s cinemas, are we still capable of putting our phones away for two hours and being honestly amazed by them, without a glaze of cynicism or irony to keep us stuck? Trevorrow, his cast and crew would clearly like to think so. And in light of their efforts, you’d have to grinningly agree."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"Jurassic World, like its genomed nemesis, is bigger, and it is pretty scary. But it's not nearly as cool, or as smart, as ""Jurassic Park."""
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"But even without world-class smarts or amusing mutations, the next generation of “Jurassic” is an enjoyable ride."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,Jurassic World gives us enough dino-mite action to stave off excitement extinction.
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"Jurassic World is an intelligent action movie that’s saying something simple but true: Yes, people are that stupid."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"Despite having a slim resume (the quirky indie Safety Not Guaranteed), Trevorrow handles Jurassic World like a pro. He hits all the right notes, giving the two-dimensional characters as much heft as they deserve (which isn't much) and handling the action sequences like a seasoned veteran of Hollywood tent pole features."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"None of this is ever quite as great as it is in Spielberg’s work, but it’s reasonably close; the worst you can say about the movie is that it sticks to a highly potent formula."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"Trevorrow seems to be genuinely enjoying what he's doing, and it's that sense of someone having fun behind the camera that ultimately won me over."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"This state-of-the-art dino epic is also more than a blast of rumbling, roaring, ""did you effing see that!"" fun. It's got a wicked streak of subversive attitude that goes by the name of Colin Trevorrow."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,75,"It's possible to filter out the irritating aspects and enjoy the movie as a raucous, often brilliantly assembled spectacle. But we shouldn't have to. The fact that we do makes an otherwise hugely impressive sequel feel small-minded."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,70,The action sequences succeed in transporting one out of the theater and into a landscape of savagery and survival.
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,70,"A whomping good time, if you don’t — and who has time to think when there’s a genetically engineered megadinosaur on the loose?"
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,70,"Despite the best efforts of director Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World's story of Indominus rex on the loose, while certainly acceptable, doesn't have the same impact as the initial film."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,70,"Jurassic World is pretty good fun. Especially for a here-today, gone-tomorrow summer blockbuster, the picture is better-crafted than it needs to be: If you ignore some extraneous plot threads, and the stop-the-presses revelation that, in the end, “what really matters is family,” Jurassic World hangs together surprisingly well."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,67,"Trevorrow and his co-screenwriters (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connolly) do bring some nice low-key touches to the thudfest, and action is satisfying, if not galvanizing."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,67,"Jurassic World, a goofy and fitfully entertaining summer movie, understands and even winks at its place in the pecking order of blockbuster sequels."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,63,"Jurassic World never breaks out of its own confines of homage and imitation. The movie ends up as an awkward, ungainly hybrid: large, but inconsequential."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,63,"Jurassic World is a roadworthy retread, a summer blockbuster that has more than its share of absurdities and bald patches but gets by anyway because dinosaurs."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,63,"Bailed out by a few good jolts, Jurassic World gets by, barely, as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,60,"Jurassic World unquestionably “delivers.” It feels like a hit; it offers a professionally crafted blend of blandness, predictability, watered-down cultural commentary and manufactured excitement."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,60,"A bronto-sized slice of big-screen entertainment buoyed by dazzling visual effects and intense action, and a film that plays like part adventure movie, part monster movie and part thrill ride."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,60,"It’s fun, but it’s ultimately more of the same in brand-new packaging."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,60,"Intensely self-conscious of its status as a cultural commodity even as it devotedly follows the requisite playbook for mass-audience blockbuster fare, Jurassic World can reasonably lay claim to the number two position among the four series entries, as it goes down quite a bit easier than the previous two sequels."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,60,"For much of its running time, Jurassic World plays like a great theme park ride. In an age of blockbusters that lumber like herbivores, it’s refreshing to see a movie as lean and mean as a velociraptor."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,60,"While slickly enjoyable in parts, the biggest misstep here comes by puncturing Spielberg’s grandeur."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,58,"Trevorrow, like so many directors given the responsibility of delivering a straightforward blockbuster designed to satisfy bottom-line expectations, struggles to find the balance between silly and serious."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,52,"Jurassic World never works all that hard to wow us, either with groundbreaking effects or with a story that remotely holds our attention."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"It’s all in good fun, and critic-proof to boot, but Jurassic World doesn’t even come close to that most intimate and dearly coveted “Gosh, wow” sense-of-wonder that the original film mustered so easily. Roar more, bite less."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"What’s missing from director Colin “Safety Not Guaranteed” Trevorrow’s thriller is that “wow factor” that Spielberg’s first outing delivered. Lacking that, and any serious effort at rethinking the story formula, Jurassic World plays like a theme park ride that’s a decade out of date."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"The most enjoyable moments of an otherwise oddly joyless film actually belong to Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus, who steal the show in an especially amusing scene during a panicked evacuation."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"Every third person on the planet will go to see this movie, and they will find exactly what they seek, nothing more but certainly nothing less. It's that nothing more part that ultimately disappoints."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"The team of four writers supplies one surprise, and you’ll wait 90 minutes to see it. Before and afterward, stereotypical genre characters get trotted out."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"It’s fun enough while it lasts, but somehow, finally, all too much and not enough. The problem isn’t that dinosaurs have ceased to impress us, but that dinosaurs alone are not enough to sustain us"
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,50,"Jurassic World can't tell whether it wants to be junk food or not, lovingly poking fun at some Hollywood tropes while shamelessly indulging others."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,42,"It turns out bigger is not better. Bigger is louder, you bet your pounding eardrums it is, but it's not smarter. More teeth aren't sharper. They're dull, and so is Jurassic World."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,40,Dull for the first hour and beefy with basic thrills for most of the second.
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,40,While Jurassic World boasts a few efficient sequences...mostly it’s a grim affair that’s not leavened by adequate humour or a palpable romantic spark between Pratt and Howard.
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,30,"There’s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn’t take the reins on this."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,25,"Jurassic World gives you exactly what Howard’s character promises at the beginning — More! Bigger! Faster! — but you know there’s something deeply wrong with a film that expects you to shed tears over digitally created prehistoric creatures and rubber brontosaurus heads instead of rooting for, you know, people."
Jurassic World,7.0,652270625,20,Mr. Pratt’s charm is no match for the crude filmmaking or the stupid plot that keeps him running around in a constant state of artificial animation.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,The best kind of summer blockbuster -- the kind that makes you immediately crave a sequel.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"It's a rich, impressive comic-book fantasy -- easily the summer's best ""blockbuster."""
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"The film's strength and its entertainment lie in John Myhre's production design, its generally appealing cast...and, perhaps most importantly, a canny degree of self-parody."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,90,"For diehard fans, X-Men is full of in jokes and sly references -- For everybody else, there's the thrill of the unknown."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,88,"Balances brains, brawn and heart in ideal proportions. The actors - some first-rate, all enjoyable - never get overshadowed by the special effects, which dazzle us without gory excess."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,85,"One of this year's most dazzling entertainments, not to mention one of the best comic-book movies ever made."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,83,"Singer deftly crafts a sleek, unusually tight film that balances comic-book adventure, pulp opera and the fear of being different."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"When it comes to stoopid fun, X-Men could be the summer movie to beat."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"Exciting mainly because anything can happen and does, the movie drags a bit as it approaches a climax set atop the Statue of Liberty."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"While X-Men doesn't take your breath away wire-to-wire the way ""The Matrix"" did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,80,"A distinctively absorbing entertainment, offering just enough popcorn thrills for mass audiences and just enough chewiness for hardcore sci-fi fans."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"The most enjoyable piece of pop fantasy of the summer; sleek, elegant, exciting and wildly, outrageously imaginative."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,A solid action story with inventive battles (one on the Statue of Liberty) and satisfyingly gooey special effects.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,Spectacular special effects and sets.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"Doesn't match up against the new millennium martial artistry of ""The Matrix,"" nor do the special effects - but he knows how to establish characters and relationships."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,This feast of fantasy is worth it.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,X-Men flies to the rescue with superheroes who have real substance.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,75,"Loaded with fine performances, traffics in audacious images and generally comports itself with a great deal more grace and gravitas than most movies with roots in fantastic themes."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,70,Nearly the perfect balance between straight-faced pulp action and amused wonder at the outlandish world of comic books.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,67,The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to view itself as a modern moral fable of sorts.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,"Recedes to a string of mere action exploits. These are proficiently executed but, for all their visual authority, not much more than routine."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,"I started out liking this movie, while waiting for something really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities if there is a sequel."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,63,A mixed bag with the promise of a better sequel.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,60,Plays like a so-so middle chapter of an epic series rather than a fitting kickoff.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,60,"Stylish, exciting and an occasionally poignant sci-fi adventure spectacle."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"The mood is awfully dark for an escapist fantasy, though, and the high-tech mayhem gets repetitious."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,A very odd cinematic creature.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"Missing are well-choreographed action scenes, likable characters and involving plot twists."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"Clumsy when it should be light on its feet, the movie takes itself even more seriously than the comic book and its fans do, which is a superheroic achievement."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,50,"When the film version isn't assaulting you with gizmos, it's an awkward, depersonalized piece of hackwork."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,38,Superhero comic book movie with a script so feeble it might have been written with crayons.
X-Men,7.4,157299717,20,"An ambitious, frustrating drag."
X-Men,7.4,157299717,10,"Isn't juvenile, it isn't even infantile. It's prenatal!"
Game Night,7.0,69001013,100,"Mark Perez has written one of the tightest comedy scripts to make it to be the big screen in ages. Game Night, directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, wastes not a single second of dialogue, gives killer lines to every member of its all-star ensemble, delivers genuinely tense action sequences, and even goes for broke with style."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,92,"Fast and funny, filled with memorable characters, and able to balance slapstick and violence without spilling too far in either direction, this frenetic R-rated farce is that rare comic gem that lands on all the spaces without ever going to jail."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,90,"It takes real intelligence to make the best dumb jokes. Game Night has plenty of both, combining skilled filmmaking and ridiculous gags in equal measure, and letting the seriousness and silliness play off of each other for maximum effect."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,88,"Watching Game Night is like witnessing someone on a hot streak while playing charades. As they keep nailing points for their team in rapid succession, you wonder how long they can sustain it. In Game Night, it’s the laughs that just keep coming."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,88,This is one of the best surprises of a still-young movie year: a comedy that takes nothing seriously except fun.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,83,"McAdams, whose comedic skills have gone unsung for way too long, is dizzy fun. The whole movie is, actually, even if it pretty much evaporates on impact — a kooky, vicarious loop of Mad Libs meets Cards Against Humanity, where whoever’s holding the popcorn last wins."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,80,"With its clever, whip-smart script and enthusiastic ensemble cast firing on all cylinders, crime comedy filmmakers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein score big with Game Night."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"It maintains its cheekiness while poking fun at the overused concept of redemption. Most importantly, it stays funny up to the beginning of the end credits, and maybe a little beyond."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,A riotous dark comedy in which a cute suburban get-together becomes a lethal nightmare.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"The overall results are unusually wholesome – and satisfyingly funny. Game Night is the kind of harmless comedy you rarely see these days, as happily entertaining as a good game of Pictionary."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"Game Night is a winner, plain and simple. Brisk and engaging (and surprisingly powered by a score from Cliff Martinez that’s expectedly great), this is a comedy that’s worth rolling the dice on."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"It’s not a movie that will make you tired, but lack of ambition can sometimes be a strength. This is a comedy-thriller made simply to please in the moment, and it does, for almost every minute of its 100-minute running time."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"Game Night is not the greatest comedy in the world, but it has a great grasp of the ingredient that makes comedy work, identified centuries ago as brevity."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,Bateman's dazzling deadpan can raise tired zingers to raucous life with only a throwaway eyebrow lift. And McAdams takes to comedy with a natural actor's grace and precision. Talk about fun company. They're it.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"There are more than enough laughs and clever surprises in this broad and sometimes violent farce to warrant a recommendation, thanks to a solidly funny script by Mark Perez, some pretty neat camera moves and choreographed action/comedic sequences from directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein — and a likable and talented ensemble cast, led by two of my favorites."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"A charismatic ensemble cast, a sharp script and a few well-placed twists make Game Night one of the more enjoyable big studio comedies in recent memory."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"It’s essentially David Fincher’s The Game matched with the comic overtones of Horrible Bosses, which is why it winds up being an entertaining jaunt."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,75,"At first, you may be inclined to reject it outright, but Game Night works so hard to win viewers over that it eventually finds its way to a winning formula."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,The back and forth between McAdams and Bateman is what makes Game Night sing.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"It won’t fix the studio comedy, but it’s a welcome, watchable outlier for now."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"It’s a good time, but it maybe could have been a great one. Which I suppose is true of so many nights meant to deliver us from the doldrums of settled life. I don’t think that meta-ness is a deliberate feature of Game Night. But with all the sharpness Daley and Goldstein show us here, I’m not ruling it out, either."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"It’s ridiculous, far-fetched — absurdist, even. Some, or even a lot, of the jokes are stupid. But thanks in part to a terrific cast, expert timing and an all-in aesthetic, it's really funny."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"A lot of the jokes are surprising, and one gag...pays off terrifically. The two top stars are delightful, and a couple of cameos are nice surprises."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,70,"The movie manipulates its audience in cunning and puckish ways. It’s no big whoop, but you’re happy to have been played."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,67,"Game Night is one of those comedy tweeners in which the jokes that click are milked too long and jokes that don’t will take too long to confirm that. Appropriately for the premise, it’ll likely be more enjoyable at home with friends."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,67,"This tame but fitfully funny goof on suspense cinema at least assembles an agreeable guest list.... As with any real game night, the company is more important than the game."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,"Like a real-life game night, the comedy may not leave a lasting impression, but it’s plenty of fun while it lasts."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,"Game Night itself is not a long night; it’s reasonably snappy. But co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein place a misjudged emphasis on keeping the violence and the action “real,” so at its most routine and generic, the movie forgets it’s supposed to be a comedy."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,The film establishes coherent characters and drops them into a twisty mystery plot that’s tightly crafted enough to generate some real narrative momentum while never getting too bogged down in its own plot that it forgets to be funny.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,63,"Way too much of Game Night is given away in the trailer, the violence is a bit much and truth be told — the folding in on itself plot gets in its own way, especially in the third act. But Bateman makes the big bucks for being the best put-upon “hero” in comedy. And McAdams, doing an epic Amanda Plummer (“Pulp You Know What,” remember?) absolutely steals the picture."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,60,"The set-pieces are quick, light and for the most part fun. What Game Night lacks in (any) plausibility or coherence it makes up for in Friday night, pleasingly brainless entertainment."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,60,The Jason Bateman comedy model hasn’t quite been radically altered in Game Night but it’s one of his more entertaining outings. Just don’t count on remembering much of it once the night is over.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,55,It’s hard to say Game Night is entirely bad. I laughed a lot and its creators are clearly capable of crafting a joke. Yet they seem to have either an incomplete or an incredibly cynical conception of what a movie is.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"The movie relies rather too heavily on McAdams’ charm, sort of like a limp cheeseburger that’s saved by some really good bacon. But hey, sometimes a fast-food cheeseburger satisfies, more or less."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"The film owes what charm it has to a whip-smart script (heavy on double entendres – a delight for word nerds and game geeks alike), and the chemistry between its actors."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"For all the energy that Rachel McAdams, Jason Bateman, and their castmates pour into their gimmicky comedy, there’s too often a feeling that they’re straining to pump up flat material."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,The movie is a pointed reminder that Ms. McAdams is one of cinema’s most accomplished and appealing comic actresses. It’s almost heartbreaking to contemplate how amazing she would be in a new comedy that was more than intermittently O.K.
Game Night,7.0,69001013,50,"There are chuckles here and there, but a striking absence of belly laughs; Girls Trip it’s decidedly not."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,40,"Bateman and McAdams have some fun with the gonzo goofiness of the project, and milk a couple of comedy set-pieces—like one about a gunshot wound and a squeaky toy—but the flatness of their characters leaves no room for relatability."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,40,"Certainly you expect a good time from Bateman and McAdams, who give their banter just the right sly, sportive rhythm even when the lines and situations themselves come up short."
Game Night,7.0,69001013,40,"The movie’s only vaguely human presence is Sharon Horgan (the gifted writer and star of TV’s Catastrophe), who gazes upon the manufactured gags with an air of chagrin. If the movie had risen even an inch to her level, Game Night might've had some game."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,100,"It is a thrilling, intelligent, deeply-felt movie that does not play by the typical rules of franchise building in modern Hollywood."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,100,"Despite its well-worn ideas and themes, Gary Ross’s provocative, pulse-surgingly tense adaptation couldn’t feel fresher, or timelier."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,100,As tough-spirited as fans would hope for - and exciting and thought-provoking in a way few adventure dramas ever are.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,91,"A muscular, honorable, unflinching translation of Collins' vision. It's brutal where it needs to be, particularly when children fight and bleed."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,90,"As action, as allegory, as cinema, The Hunger Games is the best American science-fiction film since ""The Matrix,"" and if Ross and his crew stay with the series for the next two books, we may get that rarest of things: a blockbuster franchise that earns our money through craft, emotion and execution, not merely marketing and effects."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,88,"My advice is to keep your eyes on Lawrence, who turns the movie into a victory by presenting a heroine propelled by principle instead of hooking up with the cutest boy."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,88,"A film that transforms a popular work of teen fiction not just by faithfully exploring its themes but, more important, by proving those themes have a very grown-up resonance."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,85,"There's action here, too, and a great deal of vitality that feels true both to the spirit of Collins' book and to the idea of movie entertainment as it exists."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,83,"Ultimately, Ross hasn’t just successfully mounted an adaptation of a hot literary property, or even launched a film series that earns the right to be a franchise. He’s produced an engaging, thoughtful, populist piece of entertainment that transcends gender, genre or source material."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,83,"Leaner than ""Harry Potter's"" adventures, meaner than the ""Twilight"" saga, The Hunger Games lives up to its source if not entirely the hype."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"The Hunger Games looks poised to usher in a brand new hit franchise and deserves all the credit it gets for its confrontational subject matter, delicately-orchestrated fight sequences and sci-fi sensibilities. For teen audiences, films don't get much darker - or smarter - than this."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"Katniss is gritty, she's flinty, she's intimidating -- and she doesn't have to compromise one iota of her femininity for it. And Ross' movie tells her story wonderfully."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"Making a successful Hunger Games movie out of Suzanne Collins' novel required casting the best possible performer as Katniss, and in Jennifer Lawrence director Gary Ross and company have hit the bull's-eye, so to speak."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"If the movie had a lead actress more delicate or malleable than the strong-cheeked Lawrence-a Natalie Portman, say-it would tip over into sexy-girl-killer celebration; the same goes for Harrelson's salty mentor, who is never too supportive or paternal.  Both performers lean into the economies of survival, certain of the savagery that lies ahead, and come up with sharp work."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"What's remarkable is the lack of cheese. Tacky effects, corny dialogue and creaky performances are all shown the door. We repeat: not the new ""Twilight""."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,"The Hunger Games is that rarest of beasts: a Hollywood action blockbuster that is smart, taut and knotty. Ably filleted from the Suzanne Collins bestseller, it's a compelling, lightly satirical tale."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,80,As thrilling and smart as it is terrifying. There have been a number of big-gun literary series brought to screen over the past decade. This slays them all.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,78,"The Hunger Games is first and foremost an adventure/survival story, and director Ross keeps things moving with nary a moment of downtime. There's precious little fat on the script; it's a lean, mean antifascist machine, and Lawrence is at once winsome and spectacularly engaging as Katniss (so much so that all her male costars pale into near-blandness in comparison)."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"Ross manages to keep the pacing remarkably swift, given that the games themselves don't start until halfway through the 144-minute running time."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The Hunger Games' pacing is brisk, its stakes as high as stakes get, and its leading lady engaging enough that the odds - at the box office at least - will be ever in its favor."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The action is brisk, the acting is solid, and barring an unlikely failure at the box office, a franchise is born. Let the games begin."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"This is better than any of the ""Twilights."" It features a functioning creative imagination and lots of honest-to-goodness acting by its star, Jennifer Lawrence."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"You can imagine a better adaptation of The Hunger Games, but you can much more easily imagine a far worse one, and all in all that's not a bad outcome."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"When the goal is simply to be as faithful as possible to the material - as if a movie were a marriage, and a rights contract the vow - the best result is a skillful abridgment, one that hits all the important marks without losing anything egregious. And as abridgments go, they don't get much more skillful than this one."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"What The Hunger Games does have is a game cast, a large budget well spent, Collins on board as co-writer, and Lawrence as Katniss."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The Hunger Games represents the best first book adaptation of any of the three series. It surpasses Christopher Columbus' ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone"" by a whisker and Catherine Hardwicke's ""Twilight"" by considerably more than that."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"An effective entertainment, and Jennifer Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role. But the film leapfrogs obvious questions in its path, and avoids the opportunities sci-fi provides for social criticism."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,"The games have begun, and so far they're pretty gripping."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,75,The Hunger Games is more notable for the holes it doesn't fall into than the great heights it reaches.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"Director Gary Ross' adaptation, co-scripted by Collins herself, isn't quite as crackingly paced as the novel, but it will more than satisfy existing fans of the trilogy and likely create many new ones."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"Like the pacing of the novel, the film, even at almost two and a half hours, moves briskly, continuously drawing us in."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"Lawrence is a tremendous talent, and she is what makes The Hunger Games ultimately worth spending time with. She doesn't elevate the film to the heights to which one might have wanted, but she takes it a lot higher than it would have otherwise risen."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,70,"As she did in her breakthrough film Winter's Bone, Jennifer Lawrence anchors this futuristic and politicized elaboration of The Most Dangerous Game with impressive gravity and presence, while director Gary Ross gets enough of what matters in the book up on the screen to satisfy its legions of fans worldwide."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"The Hunger Games is dressed as a dark satire of soulless entertainment, but like Katniss' adversaries in the PG-13 hunting scenes, it doesn't have a distinctive identity or go-for-the-throat."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,It also smells very much like a movie with money on its mind - not altogether successfully balancing its loftier ideas with a sense of superficial whimsy and Vegas-meets-Wizard of Oz production design.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"Where Collins' book paid careful attention to detail, Ross pays far too little. Characters never become exhausted or desperate or gaunt; they don't even get chapped lips or broken nails."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"If the series's legions of fans miss a detail here or a sub-plot there, they'll still recognize its bones and sinew, especially in Jennifer Lawrence's eagle-eyed heroine Katniss Everdeen."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"This futuristic tale of teenage violence is so not my kind of movie that I approached it grudgingly, so imagine my surprise when I ended up being totally exhilarated and enjoying it immensely."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,63,"The Hunger Games may be derivative, but it is engrossing and at times exciting. Implicitly, it argues that ""The Truman Show"" might have been improved by Ed Harris lobbing fireballs at Jim Carrey, and it's now clear what ""American Idol"" was missing all those years: a crossbow for Simon Cowell."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,"This is a solid take on the material, but it could have done with a little less narrative incident and a little more cinematic sparkle."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,"Again and again Katniss rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim, a combination that makes her insistently watchable, despite Mr. Ross's soft touch and Ms. Lawrence's bland performance."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,Director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) generally avoids the elaborate exterior shots and special effects that dominate high-concept blockbusters.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,60,A watchable enough picture that feels content to realize someone else's vision rather than claim it as its own. Any real sense of risk has been carefully ironed out: The PG-13 rating that ensures the film's suitability for its target audience also blunts the impact of the teen-on-teen bloodshed.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,50,"Watching The Hunger Games, I was struck both by how slickly Ross hit his marks and how many opportunities he was missing to take the film to the next level - to make it more shocking, lyrical, crazy, daring."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,50,"Can The Hunger Games, in the movie version directed by Gary Ross, successfully navigate the crossing from page to screen? Our answer: Eh."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,50,The Hunger Games takes no risks.
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,40,"The Hunger Games has some cool moments here and there, and is never entirely dreadful. Lawrence is both radiant and triumphant. They haven't screwed it up badly enough to kill it, although they've tried."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,30,"The result is an evasive, baffling, unexciting production - anything but a classic."
The Hunger Games,7.2,408010692,30,"In The Hunger Games it's both a feast of cheesy spectacle and a famine of genuine feeling, except for the powerful - and touchingly vulnerable - presence of Jennifer Lawrence."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,83,"The big battle in Thor: The Dark World is one of Marvel’s more genuinely rousing sequences. Once this movie gets warmed up, it’s warm through and through."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,80,"Marvel’s man with the mallet does all that’s required of him in a breakneck sequel that’s never dark for long. Next time, though, we’ll have more Loki and fewer elves."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,80,"For a movie that has dark in its title, and which is — yes! — darker (people die, Asgard is grimier, as befitting Alan Taylor’s Game Of Thrones heritage), Thor 2.0 is consistently amusing."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,75,"Superhero movies aren't going anywhere, nor is their standard, on-to-the-next-fight structure, so it's heartening to see a gem that grandly and amusingly fills in the blanks."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,75,"Like Whedon's whip-smart ""Avengers"" screenplay, Thor: The Dark World manages to acknowledge the inherently silly nature of its premise while compellingly asserting that, hey, sometimes it's fun to suspend your disbelief when the results look this good."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"The lack of chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman, plain enough in the first Thor movie, is still a problem here, but at least they've largely ditched the starry-eyed schoolgirl routine."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,It’s a highly capable sequel that drinks long and deep from the established Marvel legendarium and brings back all the key players from Kenneth Branagh’s 2011 hit “Thor.”
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"It looks like no other movie, Marvel or otherwise, and it’s populated by characters compelling enough to support a more complex, richer story than this one."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"Thor: The Dark World gets a lot more entertaining in the second hour, when the shape-shifting Loki is sprung from his cell (for complicated reasons) and immediately begins trading bitchy insults with his forthright, manly brother."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,70,"This robust, impersonal visual-effects showpiece proves buoyant and unpretentious enough to offset its stew of otherwise derivative fantasy/action elements."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,67,"Forget the fairy-tale romance between Jane and her hammer-wielding hunk. The real emotional center of the Thor series is this sibling rivalry, more compelling than any climactic battle royale or winking teaser for the next chapter."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,67,"After the recent rash of superhero end-spectacles as long-winded and self-serious as a term paper, the limited ambition of The Dark World’s climax is a relief. It scuttles all term paper aspirations and instead humbly lobs a thesis statement-slash-open invitation: Let’s have some fun, shall we? And so we did."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,67,"Hiddleston, with pleading eyes and a mad-dog grin, plays Loki as a wounded sociopath who's cackling at the world but seething on the inside. Which makes you realize he's just about the only character in the movie who has an inside."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"The movie is pretty to look at in a ""Transformers"" sort of way and moves briskly enough that it never threatens to bore, but it's hard to feel much of anything about the characters and, when it's all over, there's a sense that everything that happens is obligatory."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"One of the problems with The Dark World is that its monsters and angry armies and visual effects are interchangeable with Peter Jackson's Tolkien pics, with Clash of the Titans, with The Avengers, with Man of Steel, and on and on.
These superhero movies. These Middle Earth movies. These mythic god movies. It's getting hard to tell them apart."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"Thor: The Dark World's characters are often very charming, but they're only so much fun when they're stuck going through the motions."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"A good model of how superheroes can save the world without forced gravitas, and have fun doing it."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"Compared to other Marvel characters, Thor is a difficult sell."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"This Thor sequel is way funnier than any movie subtitled The Dark World has a right to be (thanks, Hiddleston). And the blowout climax pitting Thor against Malekith and the elves is excitingly staged. It's just that waiting for the good stuff can be a real mood-killer."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"So how's this ""Thor"" sequel? It's fairly entertaining. Same old threats of galaxy annihilation, spiced with fish-out-of-water jokes."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"At times Thor: The Dark World does fire on all cylinders, with fine work from the returning cast, a handful of hilarious sight gags and some cool action sequences. But it’s also more than a little bit silly and quite ponderous and overly reliant on special effects that are more confusing than exhilarating."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,63,"The design is brighter and sharper, the jokes are broader and the villainy utterly generic in this by-the-(comic)-book adaptation."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,"There’s nothing in Thor: The Dark World that wasn’t done better in “Thor,” or a lot better in “The Avengers.” Except Tom Hiddleston’s performance as Loki."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,"Thor: The Dark World may not be thunder from the movie gods, but it is — shock! — an entertaining journey into mystery, action and fun."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,"This is a deeply silly, extremely noisy and sometimes impenetrable action movie that’s drowning in CGI, wild overacting and mullets. And it’s enormously entertaining."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,60,No amount of tool-wielding heroism can save The Dark World from being a startlingly unbalanced movie.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,58,"My favorite moment in the movie: Astrophysicist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) insisting on wearing only his underwear because he says he thinks better that way. Hey, whatever works."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,52,"If only all of Thor: The Dark World could capture the magic of its last act, the film wouldn’t feel like such a chink in Marvel’s otherwise solid armor."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Bigger is not always better. Thor: The Dark World pumps up the action and special effects and loses some of the human element that made the original ""Thor"" something charming and unexpected. True, this sequel gets better as it goes along, but that's a very steep climb just to arrive at not bad."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Poor Thor. Dude can't even hold center stage in his own movie. He's the Asgardian god of stolen thunder, upstaged at each ab turn by Loki, malarkey and Odin's eyepatch."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,Has its moments of visual invention and self-aware humor — mostly when the hero’s trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is around — but otherwise it’s an awkwardly plotted extravaganza.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Leaden, non-involving and filled with mind-numbing computer-generated effects."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,There’s a fleet and funny comic-book movie nestled inside Thor: The Dark World. You catch glimpses of it here and there.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Hiddleston steals the show here, making wickedness and treachery look a heck of a lot more fun than virtue."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"Although director Alan Taylor manages to get things going properly for the final battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,50,"A film that is enjoyable in spots, but haphazard and ultimately unsatisfying."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"None of that is to say that Thor: The Dark World is a bad movie, necessarily. I would never speak ill of a man with a giant, magical hammer. At the same time, hammer or no hammer, it doesn't quite nail it, either."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"The clutter makes your head feel like it's about to explode - and not in a good way, with wonders upon wonders. Instead it seems like arcana that might show up on the midterm final: the next Marvel movie."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"This is a superhero movie that feels like it might have been made by anyone and no one at the same time, simply space-filler before the next big team-up movie."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"Lacking Iron Man’s wit, the Hulk’s brains, and the Captain’s ideals, he’s in peril of going poof himself if the franchise doesn’t figure out how to capitalize on its most glorious hero."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,40,"It feels entirely made by committee – the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,38,"""Dark World” is low-stakes, low-emotion, lowbrow."
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,30,The battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story.
Thor: The Dark World,6.9,206362140,30,"The larger problem, transcending all realms, is that this action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,91,An astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,"A highly entertaining and visually breathtaking movie, capable at times of rocking and delighting you."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,"Not a masterpiece, but it's an example of how imagination, craftsmanship, and technological bravura can fashion superior entertainment out of something that is far from flawless."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,"Avoid the hype, just go enjoy the movie"
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,88,It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,83,Let the killjoys squawk. Lucas has proved he has the Naboos to pull it off again. And again. And again.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,80,"The computer-driven effects are impressive, but the adventure is hampered by a flat screenplay, dull acting, and just a hint as to why the dark side of the Force will eventually transform cute little Anakin into the evil Darth Vader."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,80,"Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale -- which copies Return Of The Jedi's triple-climax structure -- The Phantom Menace has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,75,"Fails to recapture the elemental magic of Star Wars, and that, ironically, is because it represents the coarse culmination of the original film's adrenaline aesthetic."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,75,"It does the job just fine. That job, as director George Lucas freely admits, is quite simply to thrill the beating hearts and the inquiring minds of 12-year-old boys."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,70,"Good enough, but only just. It's got the hardware, but neither the characters, the imagination, nor the resonance one had hoped for."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,67,"In the end, Phantom needed more human and less digital scale. The magic of ""Star Wars"" lay in Lucas' ability to play the human comedy in a fantastic future. With Phantom, he has brought the series to the brink of total artificiality, the future as a video game."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,63,"It's a kiddie movie rejiggered for childish grown-ups, of whom there are enough to make it a hit. How such childishness has become a virtual secular religion is hard to imagine."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,63,Not at all bad for a toy commercial.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,63,"What I mean is that to watch The Phantom Menace as a lifelong ""Star Wars"" fan is to engage in constant, fragile negotiations between a cherished familiarity and the shock of the new."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"Phantom is easily consumable eye candy, but it contains no nutrients for the heart or mind."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"I warn you, I'm gonna continue whining about the movie. Just keep in mind that I liked it."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"The entire film is curiously soulless, with major characters making their entrances and exits (some of which are unexpectedly final) as if they were breezing in from some other screening next door."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"""Star Wars"" fans deserve better."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,60,"In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy, not yet."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,"While the new film is certainly serviceable, it's noticeably lacking in warmth and humor, and though its visual strengths are real and considerable, from a dramatic point of view it's ponderous and plodding."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,The Empire strikes out.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,Story. Character. They used to mean something to George Lucas.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,All the state-of-the-art technology in the world is no help to an actor saddled with Lucas's tinny dialogue.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,50,It is likely to disappoint more people than creator George Lucas would have liked.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,George Lucas does it his way in the pallid Phantom Menace. Even cultists will wish he'd hired a director and some writers.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,"This ain't no movie. It's a very long, very tedious infomercial for Phantom Menace action figures, on sale now at a Target or Toys ""R"" Us near you."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,"The Phantom Menace is simply a billboard for itself. Anyone who sees it will be experiencing it for the second time. The hype was not about the movie, the hype was the movie."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6.5,474544677,40,"It's difficult to discern precisely where this all went wrong, and even more difficult to speculate about possible improvements."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,90,"After undergoing some unfortunate mutations in recent years, a beleaguered Marvel movie property gets the smart, stylish prequel it deserves in X-Men: First Class."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,88,"In this cheerfully perverse origin tale of Magneto, Professor X and their mutant team, Vaughn delivers a fireworks display of action, smarts and fun, plus a touch of class from actors who can really act."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,88,"Most of the actors live their roles, and Fassbender (Rochester in the last ""Jane Eyre"") is superb as the wolflike, undisciplined assassin."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,83,"McAvoy and Fassbender are a casting triumph. These two have, yes, real star magnetism, both individually and together: They're both cool and intense, suave and unaffected, playful and dead serious about their grand comic-book work."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,80,"It's not the artistry of X-Men: First Class that's particularly striking; though it's finely crafted, the film feels less the product of a visionary director than of the Marvel movies machine working at maximum efficiency."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,80,"This prequel draws new energy from supersmart casting, plus the shrewd notion of setting the beginnings of the X-Men saga in the early 1960s."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,80,"Audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"At least Erik/Magneto, as played by Michael Fassbender, is, well, magnetic."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"That's partly why X-Men: First Class is such fanboy fun, as the script departs from official Marvel lore to invent a whole new ""origin story"" for the mutant ensemble."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"This X- Men is indeed first class: an exciting, bold and thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,First Class happily delivers on the escapism and rich narrative texture the best of its predecessors have promised.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"Fassbender plays Magneto as a supercool assassin with a completely understandable set of beefs. I spent most of the movie rooting for him, and would watch a ""Magneto, 1960s Nazi Hunter"" sequel in a second."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,Another crowd-pleasing comic-book film designed to bring in new fans while gratifying the old ones.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,An uncommonly polished and sophisticated superhero movie.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"Director Matthew Vaughn, who did last year's delightful ""Kick-Ass,"" doesn't do witty this time around, but he does keep up a spiffing pace while making the action blaze."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"Perfectly fine summer folderol, epic enough on its own terms if not quite big enough to expand beyond its genre and matter to people who find it difficult to care about characters who spit gobs of flaming phlegm. I realize there are fewer and fewer of us, but we're a hardy band and stubborn."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,75,"X-Men: First Class still sings the praises of Marvel Studios' marvelous quality control of comic book movies. It's good, clean summer movie fun where the money they spend is up on the screen - with actors and effects - so that we won't mind spending our money on it."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"So while X-Men: First Class at first takes its source material with just the right amount of self-deprecating seriousness, it founders in the second half, when it becomes overburdened with squirrelly plot mechanics and an excess of self-evident dialogue."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"With its spy-on-spy globetrotting, old-fashioned villains, flirty but prematurely swinging minis and fan-boy bits (look for an eye-blink-fast tribute to ""Basic Instinct"" and a cameo from the cult actor Michael Ironside), the whole enterprise has an agreeable lightness, no small thing, given its rapidly moving parts."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"X-Men: First Class isn't anywhere close to being a genre classic like ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""The Dark Knight,"" but it is good enough to rejuvenate a franchise stuck on idle."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,70,"What the film does well, however, is grasp the tone and rhythm of the original comic books."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,67,"It's all vastly superior to Brett Ratner's scorched-earth ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" of course."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,The easiest way to summarize my reaction to X-Men: First Class is with a shrug.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"X-Men: First Class is a mutant movie, half fun and half fearsome. For those who have developed an immunity to fanboy hype, the contradictory traits may seem to weaken rather than strengthen this beast, but readers of the ""X-Men"" comics will hail an origin story as satisfying as ""Thor."""
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"An elaborate origins story with more datelines than an issue of Condé Nast Traveler (Oxford! Miami! Argentina! Poland!), X-Men: First Class has some fun trying to explain how Professor X, Magneto, and all those mopey mutants came to be."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"X-Men: First Class is competent weekend entertainment. It is not a great comic book movie, like ""Spider-Man 2,"" or a bad one, like ""Thor."" It is not in 3-D, which is a mercy."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,63,"Still, the deadliest single element in this film can be traced not to Bacon's character, but to composer Henry Jackson, whose music seems determined to kill us all with waves of dramatic nothingness."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,60,"Like Bryan Singer's X2 (2003), this fifth entry in the X-Men franchise is noteworthy for its gay-rights subtext and for its noted actors delivering comic book dialogue with Shakespearean portent. Otherwise it's indistinguishable from most other recent blockbusters."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,60,"It's big, bright, savvy, and so expansive you'll undoubtedly leave feeling you got your money's worth."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,60,"All you'd expect from an X-Men film (or spin-off, or prequel), but not all you'd hope for. It smacks of rush and compromise, but there's thankfully enough to make you feel optimistic about the series' future once more."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,50,"Uneven, occasionally silly, true, but it's also an improvement over 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand."""
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,50,These ludicrous but endearing moments of bro-bonding are all that sets this otherwise stock-issue superhero movie apart from its mass-produced brethren.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,50,I was startled to look up the running time and discover that X-Men: First Class is only 104 minutes; the second half is so clunky it feels much longer.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,40,Too bad that First Class torpedoes its lofty intentions with flights of idiocy so wrongheaded as to be almost endearing.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,40,It's just another franchise nonstarter to toss in the superstore superhero deal bin.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,40,A tedious two-plus hours. There were such possibilities in the origins idea.
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,38,"Despite his apparent comfort with F/X-heavy projects, the obligations of duty to the brand are too much for Matthew Vaughn's strange, singular voice, which rarely has the chance to shape the film unmolested by a curiously bland script."
X: First Class,7.7,146408305,30,"A cameo from an old-school X-Man only serves to remind how stylish and witty the first installment was a decade ago. Lacking a single memorable joke or striking image, First Class is as perfunctory and passionless as would-be franchise resurrections get."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,88,"I lost count but the word “family” is mentioned upwards of 50 times, many more times than it is in, say, Lilo & Stitch. Yes, it is way too much, like everything else in this aggressively over-the-top film, but at the same time, it just feels nice to be part of the group."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,88,"Diesel and Johnson are at their testosterone-charged best. Theron, who seems to be auditioning to become the next Bond villain, is ruthlessness personified."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,83,"The Fate of the Furious doesn't merely suspend disbelief, it expels it like a delinquent student told to never come back."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,83,"The Fate of the Furious is almost impossible not to like. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do, successfully lighting up the brain’s pleasure centers at each opportunity with a variety of tools in its arsenal."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,80,"The biggest show is, naturally, saved for last.... Nothing in all of the Fast & Furious movies has ever felt bigger or more ridiculous — two things F8 rightfully thrives on. It’s exhilarating. Now how will they top this one?"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,80,"The Fate of the Furious is nothing more than pulp done smart, but scene for scene it’s elegant rather than bombastic, and it packs a heady escapist wallop."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,78,"What sets apart this eighth outing is its giggling bouts of male henpecking, all puffed feathers and nyah-nyah taunts."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"If the fate of the Furious series is to grow somehow both wearier and dumber with age, then the eighth film is proof of a mission firmly accomplished. And there’s no shame, Vin, in hanging it all up after a job well done."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"Polar chaos notwithstanding, “Fate” delivers action with more consistent visual precision than in the last couple of films, as newly enlisted director F. Gary Gray accesses the flair he brought to 2003’s “The Italian Job.”"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The movie zips along quickly, full of popcorn-worthy moments."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The action is not just big — big is easy. It’s creative. It’s choreographed. It’s unexpected and delightful. It’s lots of fun and a stark contrast to the previous film, “Furious 7,” which was huge but flat, just commotion without inspiration."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"Your mileage may vary when it comes to the over-the-top carnage and in-your-face machismo, but it’s impressive just how bonkers Fate is, like a litter of kittens hopped up on grade-A catnip."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The Fate of the Furious doesn't have a thought in its head to match the best of Bond and Bourne. What it is, in every sense of the term, is insanely entertaining."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,75,"The movie Tokyo-drifts into tedium in its more chaotic, casually gruesome chase scenes, and the “serious” dialogue is so consistently clunky it feels like it’s been carved from woodblocks with a dull butterknife. Thankfully, it’s frequently also much funnier and lighter on its feet than previous outings, and a lot of that credit goes to Statham and Johnson."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,70,The spectacle gives you enough action from enough famous names to sustain the momentum of its legacy.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,65,"Gray’s prosaic style robs Fate of the Furious of any real sense of self-awareness or humor, which could never be said about Lin or Wan’s installments."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,"“Dumbing down” was coined for productions like this: big, splashy, testosterone-fueled monstrosities whose sole purpose is to give a studio box office bragging rights for a few weeks."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,"“Fate” gives fans of the franchise exactly what they want, provided they can ditch logic as easily as the movie does."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,63,The Fate of the Furious distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Zoom, crash, repeat with squealing, burning and flaming tires — it’s all predictably absurd and self-mocking, and often a giggle when not a total yawn."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"It’s an odd sensation to watch a Fast & Furious film and find yourself wishing the special effects lived up to the writing, but – well, here we are."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"A very big, exceedingly dumb thrill ride."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"This is a big dumb action movie in its purest, most honourable sense: fast, furious and frequently fun."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Fast 8 is more of the same, more or less, with the emphasis heavily on more."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Overall, there’s a sense that ‘Fast and Furious 8’ knows exactly where it wants to go and won’t bust a gasket getting there: you might ask for a little more character work here, a few more plot surprises there, but on the whole this rattles along just fine."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,60,"Fate delivers exactly what fans have come to expect, for better and for worse."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,58,"While The Fate of the Furious is an unquestionably enjoyable outing, it’s beginning to feel a lot like fatigue on a long-enduring franchise."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,58,"More so than in any of the other movies, Dom’s wrecking crew of car nuts comes across like survival-of-the-speediest tacho-fascists, high-fiving their way through a path of destruction and to a collateral death toll that one presumes now numbers in the hundreds."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"There are disposable characters, and not just the villain’s minions. But one of the dumber elements of these movies is how so few of the actual leads, friend or foe, from previous pictures seem to stay dead."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"With The Fate of the Furious, it feels like the movies have gotten as big as they can get, and the gleeful absurdity that drove them is losing ground to the specter of obligation."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"In my favorite scene, Hobbs leads his tween daughter’s soccer team in a haka (Maori war dance) to intimidate their rivals. Can’t wait for “Fast and Furious 11: No Boys Allowed.”"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"There’s certainly a lot to enjoy in The Fate of the Furious, but even the strongest moments are less spectacular this time around."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"The problem this time around is the plot is particularly idiotic, the supposedly snappy quips are lame and come at some weirdly inappropriate moments — and it’s all delivered in an extremely bloated package."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"This is just the sweeps-week Fast And Furious that jumps the shark, ready to right itself come next season – and it better. Dominic Toretto’s team deserves to go out in a blaze of glory, not a slippery skid that can’t be controlled."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"Really, the movie is the third cheeseburger, the fourth beer, the fifth ice-cream sandwich. It’s gluttony, which is kind of enjoyable when you’re in the middle of committing it but leaves you feeling sluggish and remorseful later when you’ve had time to think about it."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"Even as Fate has its fun and chases its highs (a few of which are pretty satisfying), it’s hard to shake the growing sensation that the bloom might be coming off the rose."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"The action has become incoherent, largely past the point of enjoyability."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,50,"It's ridiculous but fun, as it careens from Havana to Berlin and icy, terrorist-ridden Russia played by Iceland, and a spit-ton of medium-grade digital effects. But the second hour gets to be a real drag, and not the racing kind."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,42,"F8 is the worst of these films since “2 Fast 2 Furious,” and it may be even worse than that. It’s the “Die Another Day” of its franchise — an empty, generic shell of its former self that disrespects its own proud heritage at every turn."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,40,"The series seems to have at last entered its frustrating, decadent, spinning-its-wheels phase."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,40,There is only one inventive action sequence here.
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,38,"The film finally tips the franchise over from modestly thoughtful stupidity into tedious, loud inanity."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,20,"Is it so much to ask for dialogue that doesn’t make you roll your eyes throughout “F8”? Or, you know, a story that adds up?"
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,20,"""Fast and Furious"" movies are supposed to be unchallenging, but Fate of the Furious is full-on brain-dead."
The Fate of the Furious,6.7,226008385,0,"Who am I to call it soulless, graceless, witless, incoherent — even for the franchise — and, not incidentally, brain-numbingly long at 136 minutes?"
300,7.7,210614939,100,"We've seen plenty of sword-and-sandal epics, full of robustly virile men fighting like real men against other men. But we've never seen those hyper-macho mechanics presented with the brutal beauty and thrilling finesse of 300, clearly the best film of 2007 so far."
300,7.7,210614939,83,"Director Zack Snyder uses his computers to create ferocious and painterly images, with as much attention to each frame as a hand-drawn panel."
300,7.7,210614939,80,"A newfangled old-fashioned movie about glory, honor, sacrifice and a martial code that crosses into fascism, homoerotism and homophobia at the same time -- there are plenty of turn-off buttons in this one. But by Zeus, this is a ripping yarn, told with limb-rending gusto, an iconic ancient battle as seen by an iconic comic-book creator, Frank Miller."
300,7.7,210614939,80,"300 is a feast for the senses (well, two of them anyway) and an impressive technical achievement. More than that, it's a hell of a lot of fun."
300,7.7,210614939,78,"Not since Mario Bava's ""Hercules in the Haunted World"" has Greco-Roman movie-house mythmaking been so thoroughly well-conceived and executed."
300,7.7,210614939,75,"300 may not offer masterful storytelling in a conventional sense, but it's hard to beat as a spectacle and that makes it worthwhile viewing for all but the most squeamish of potential audience members."
300,7.7,210614939,75,"Look, but don't be touched: There is much to see but little to remember in this telling of a battle we are meant never to forget."
300,7.7,210614939,75,300 is a movie blood-drunk on its own artful excess. Guys of all ages and sexes won't be able to resist it.
300,7.7,210614939,75,300 is a huge step forward in visually sophisticated storytelling.
300,7.7,210614939,75,Cinema has once again proven its ability to incorporate every other mass-media art form. Director Zack Snyder and his computer wizards have made the best example yet of the movie-as-comic-book.
300,7.7,210614939,75,It's impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault.
300,7.7,210614939,75,"Significantly, this hyper-stylization of 300 is limited to its visuals. The performances are played straight, and this combination -- straight performances and stylized visuals -- produces an uncanny effect."
300,7.7,210614939,75,"It may not be by-the-book history -- a relative term in any event, when discussing the ancients whose worldview embraced men, gods and monsters -- but what a spectacle!"
300,7.7,210614939,70,"In epic battle scenes where he combines breathtaking and fluid choreography, gorgeous 3-D drawings and hundreds of visual effects, director Zack Snyder puts onscreen the seemingly impossible heroism and gore of which Homer sang in ""The Iliad."""
300,7.7,210614939,70,The movie swings back and forth from awesome to awful so regularly and rapidly that it's like a jai alai match.
300,7.7,210614939,67,"This is a mixed blessing. For a story replete with open-air combat 300 is strangely claustrophobic. And for a film with lotsa flesh and even more blood, it's light on flesh-and-blood characters."
300,7.7,210614939,63,"300 is at its best when it settles for purely visceral thrills, such as Leonidas' battle against a hulking warrior twice the size of a normal man. The movie's broad strokes are all superlative: It's the details that keep 300 from being anything more than a striking curiosity."
300,7.7,210614939,63,"The action epic 300 is so overblown, overheated and over the top that on some level, it's fun to get caught up in the operatic dizziness of it."
300,7.7,210614939,63,"A blustery, bombastic, visually arresting account of the Battle of Thermopylae as channeled through the rabid imagination of graphic novelist Frank Miller."
300,7.7,210614939,60,"Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy’s paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance."
300,7.7,210614939,60,"300 is ""Gladiator"" for the gamer set."
300,7.7,210614939,50,Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought – it's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych.
300,7.7,210614939,50,"300 is something to see, but unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated."
300,7.7,210614939,50,That it's so flat as an action movie probably has a lot to do with why people might prefer to jawbone over its putatively controversial aspects--there's really not much of a “wow” factor to revel in.
300,7.7,210614939,50,"There's a stale, synthetic airlessness about the movie. Imagine a large cast trapped in a series of spectacular screensavers. It could be ancient Greece. It could be somebody's hard drive."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"The disconnect between the human actors and the digital backgrounds is more pronounced here than in a futuristic adventure like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" and because classic Hollywood cinema is so rich with epic images of antiquity, this can't help but seem chintzy."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"Sensory gluttony is reason enough to see a movie, and few epics overstuff the eyes like this one."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"Part of the fascination of the Thermopylae story is that it really happened, and it helped define real heroism. There's nothing remotely like reality to be had in this film."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"My deepest objection to the movie is that it is so blood-soaked. When dialogue arrives to interrupt the carnage, it's like the seventh-inning stretch."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"It has to be said that there is a level of cheerfully self-aware ridiculousness, which means that 300 is not entirely without entertainment value."
300,7.7,210614939,50,"A fun-sapped maelstrom without meaning, 300 simply pummels you with endless loops of battle-porn. While you couldn’t classify the movie as entertainment, it might have a long, prosperous future as a Clockwork Orange–style Ludovico Technique."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"300 will be talked about as a technical achievement, the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"The bigger question to ask about 300 is why, for a supposedly rousing tale of heroism, it's so curiously unaffecting."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"Snyder attaches no larger significance to his arresting visuals. He’s only intent on eliciting “Whoa, dude!” reactions, of which there are fewer and fewer once it becomes clear that there’s nothing sustaining the centerpiece razzle-dazzle sequences except awful dialogue and no-dimensional characters."
300,7.7,210614939,40,"As you watch -- no, endure -- this flattened-out spectacle, there's really nothing worth pondering save for a single thought: What a difference a director makes."
300,7.7,210614939,38,"It's kind of a ghastly hoot, and while I suppose it does no harm, it also contributes nothing. It's a guilty unpleasantness."
300,7.7,210614939,38,"Another movie -- Matt Stone and Trey Parker's ""Team America,"" whose wooden puppets were more compelling actors than most of the cast of 300 -- calculated the cost [of freedom] at $1.05. I would happily pay a nickel less, in quarters or arcade tokens, for a vigorous 10-minute session with the video game that 300 aspires to become."
300,7.7,210614939,30,"300 presents a dual clash of civilizations. An action adventure that pits thousands of Persians against 300 brave Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae, it also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band, or so I choose to think of us, who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity."
300,7.7,210614939,30,"Pop has always drawn energy from the lower floors of respectability; this movie, in which fan-boy cultism reaches new levels of goofy chaos and sexual confusion, draws energy from the subbasement."
300,7.7,210614939,30,"It's a ponderous, plodding, visually dull picture, but the blame shouldn't be put on Snyder's skills per se, and has nothing to do with his ambition to blur the distinction between CGI and photography. Frankly, it's the slavish, frame-by-frame devotion to Miller's source material that's the problem."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,80,"The pacing is spot-on, the set-pieces memorable and all the characters are allowed to shine, without it ever becoming The Johnny Depp Show."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,75,"""Dead Men” works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue peppered with not particularly sophisticated but (I have to admit) fairly funny sexual innuendo."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,75,"Johnny Depp’s drunken Captain Jack Sparrow stumbles into yet another seafaring adventure, which has its rocky moments but also offers an engaging tale with family legacies, above-average swashbuckling and a fantastic new villain courtesy of Javier Bardem"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,70,"Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn’t rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley—creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that’s instantly forgettable. You know, like the ride itself."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg work up a stormy sea-parting finale that is better than anything in “The Ten Commandments.” Again, the trick to enjoying this film is to expect nothing."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"What we get is the usual mash of swashbuckling nonsense and soggy mythology: There will be romance, and revelations, and some silly gold-plated cameos (hello there, Sir Paul McCartney! And whoops, goodbye). Through it all, Norwegian duo Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (the Oscar-nominated Kon-Tiki) feel less like directors than shepherds."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,67,"Kon-Tiki directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are at the helm this time around, proving capable captains even if the script they’re working from isn’t always seaworthy."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,65,"The fifth entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it’s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,It’s fast paced but goes nowhere new and the film’s “bigness” makes it hard to remember what an amazingly unexpected treasure The Curse of the Black Pearl was.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,"Much as Bardem enlivens things, the real source of zip is Kaya Scodelario (“Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials”). Charming and spirited, she’s Daisy Ridley dialed up a notch."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,63,"Kon Tiki directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg strike just the right tone, and found just enough heart left in this tattered tale."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales manages to be less bloated, dreary, and meandering than the last three entries have been, but it still suffers from many of the same wearisome, dredged-up villains and ho-hum action and comedy that have bedeviled the franchise since its second installment."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,I found Dead Men Tell No Tales to be passably fun and certainly no harder to watch than any of the better-pedigreed blockbusters this year.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), taking over from series regulars Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, doesn’t make much sense out of the typically (for the franchise) convoluted plot, but does manage to bring out a father-child theme that lends the film a little emotional resonance."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"The gonzo-Wagnerian backstory the franchise subsequently built up hasn’t been sufficiently pruned – and with so many characters to juggle, the story feels less like a coherent chain of events than a bundle of obligatory subplots."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,60,"It's hardly original nor necessary, but it's a fun and absorbing escapade on the Seven Seas."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,58,"Waste enough of the audience’s time with the adventures of a couple of uncharismatic dinguses, and Depp’s stage-drunk, innuendo-laced, cabaret-emcee shtick starts to creep back into being funny."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"The most engaging performance is Javier Bardem’s solidly nasty Captain Salazar, the undead commander of a ghost ship. His disintegrating skin and holey crew are fabulously rendered as evaporating digitizations: It’s the special effects and swelling action sequences that make the movie palatable."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,The franchise has sadly devolved into a cynical cash grab.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,Those who go to see “Dead Men Don’t Tell Tales” might just recognize that hollow feeling as they leave the theater.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"Loud, overstimulating and hard to take in all in one sitting, it feels like the vacation that you’ll need a vacation from."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,Calling Dead Men Tell No Tales the most entertaining Pirates of the Caribbean movie since the original is a backhanded compliment with all the bilge water under the bridge since then. Time to deep six Capt. Jack Sparrow. This franchise should tell no more tales.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"The proportions of good parts to not are more generous than they’ve been in years, though there’s still much too much of the usual undead sea dogs killing their prisoners and rumbling on about curses."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,50,"Dead men may tell no tales, but with Disney's latest Pirates sequel, I'm not convinced that living men can tell tales with any more intrigue."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,42,"As the coldly calculated Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales proves, it is time to let this series rest in peace, or at the very least, spend the rest of its doomed, immortal days sinking to the bottom of the ocean."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"There are no new treasures to be found in this installment, which is dragged down by the anchor of a prescribed franchise blueprint."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,Dead Men Tell No Tales tries to serve far too many masters with its story.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,This movie is exhausting.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Not the return to form you might have been hoping for. Its story might cover all the same beats as the 2003 original, but there’s little of that film’s spark or spirit."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"The franchise has lost a bit of its luster with every successive installment, but never has a “Pirates” film felt this inessential, this depressingly pro forma."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Scodelario, of the Maze Runner films and Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights, is just about the only member of the cast who seems to believe she's expected to be more than a thin generic functionary or flamboyant scene-stealer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Unfortunately for everyone, Captain Jack Sparrow is still slurring and staggering around the Caribbean. Whatever charm and charisma Johnny Depp once had in this role is well and truly lost at sea."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,40,"Dead Men Tell No Tales moves at a faster rate of knots than any Pirates film; trouble is, nothing has really been added. It’s the same soggy ride, set to a marginally preferable speed."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,38,"Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (“Kon-Tiki”) seem to not have the slightest idea how to make this material sing; instead, it’s mostly a noisy, dark 3D blur in which the characters run around a lot, seemingly looking for the exits"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,33,"The film is not unlike a classic rock supergroup reuniting to play all the greatest hits, with the payday at the end as the only true motivation, rather than returning with something new to say about their work."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,30,It’s stuffed to the gills with effects executed by the highest-paid artists and technicians in the business. But it’s still a sorry spectacle.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,30,"This ship has sailed, sank, and not to put too fine a bowsprit on it, sucks."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,30,Dead Men Tell No Tales is the sort of sequel that’s so bad it makes you retroactively wonder why you liked the original film so much in the first place.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,"Bloated, boring, repetitive, draining."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,"It’s a little less cute these days to watch his Jack Sparrow swish about drunkenly, knowing the actor’s an abusive lush. Equally wearisome is the spectacle of a once-entertaining franchise staggering around, devoid of purpose."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,25,“Dead Men” is a jumble of half-baked impulses.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,20,"Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,16,"There’s no voice, no style, and no real intrigue on hand. It’s all a slow sail to the next outsized setpiece."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,12,Johnny Depp’s perfunctory gestures and flailing pratfalls befit a film that brings the franchise’s theme-park roots full circle.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,6.6,172558876,0,"This movie is truly unhinged — not crazed, which might be interesting, but devoid of the usual hinges that connect one sequence with another."
Dune,6.6,30925690,90,"While it's hardly a cohesive experience, individual scenes are brought to life with striking power."
Dune,6.6,30925690,75,"For all its cumbersome scope (realized on a shimmeringly large scale by Lawrence of Arabia cinematographer Freddie Francis), the film remains an intensely personal epic, Lynch's uncommon emphasis on characters rather than effects lending his exposition a rather remarkable lucidity."
Dune,6.6,30925690,70,"Lynch's third feature may have been a commercial disaster, but it gets under your skin and is marked by unforgettable images and an extraordinary soundtrack."
Dune,6.6,30925690,70,A most fascinating disaster of genre making.
Dune,6.6,30925690,60,"Dune is a huge, hollow, imaginative and cold sci-fi epic. Visually unique and teeming with incident, David Lynch's film holds the interest due to its abundant surface attractions but won't, of its own accord, create the sort of fanaticism which has made Frank Herbert's 1965 novel one of the all-time favorites in its genre."
Dune,6.6,30925690,60,"DUNE is visually delightful but choppy, confusing, and overloaded with exposition. Moreover, most of the thematic material that made the novel work--subtexts involving incestuous desire, capitalism vs. environmentalism, and Middle East politics--is simply missing."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"How maddening Dune is! As you would expect from visionary director David Lynch, it is a movie of often staggering visual power, the most ambitious science fiction film since ""2001""; it's also stupefyingly dull and disorderly. Dune doesn't get going till fully two hours have elapsed, so only the most patient will wait for the images to build to their crescendo. Lax in its storytelling, Dune gives us sublimity unmoored."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"The problem is that the imagery—as Sadean as Pasolini's Salo—isn't rooted in any story impulse, and so its power dissipates quickly. The real venue for this film is either a grind house or the Whitney Museum."
Dune,6.6,30925690,50,"So inward and remote does the movie seem, it might have arrived in a time capsule from one of the four warring planets. Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is as difficult as a final exam. You have to cram for it."
Dune,6.6,30925690,40,"SEVERAL of the characters in Dune are psychic, which puts them in the unique position of being able to understand what goes on in the movie."
Dune,6.6,30925690,40,"This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,90,A pretty damn good summer movie.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"The script doesn't do a great job with either the spiritual or the physical trek, but the spectacular action sequences occur with enough regularity that strong writing isn't necessary to keep Waterworld afloat."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,Costner's surfer-bum affectlessness works here; he turns the Mariner into the world's most jaded lifeguard.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"A two hour aquatic pursuit pic with bruising stunts, fun-to-watch performances, a dozen good chortles and imposing Panavision renderings of post-apocalyptic crud, Waterworld clearly has the makings of a cult movie."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,75,"If the story seems a little waterlogged, it's still big, loud, and fun to watch."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,70,"Nowhere near the Hollywood disaster that was foretold, Waterworld is a near-model summer fantasy: two hours and 21 minutes of loud, expansive fun."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,67,"A decent futuristic action picture with some great sets, some intriguing ideas, and a few images that will stay with me."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,63,"A not-bad futuristic actioner with three or four astounding sequences, an unusual hero, a nifty villain and less mythic and romantic resonance than might be desired."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,60,"Waterworld isn't ""Fishtar,"" but Kevin Costner's pricey, post-apocalyptic sloshbuckler isn't a seafaring classic either."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,"Its mediocrity guarantees this lavish, soggy retread of futuristic Australian action classic ""The Road Warrior"" a place in the ranks of forgotten extravaganzas."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,It's really not bad... It's a genuine vault at greatness that misses the mark -- but survives.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,Sublimely ridiculous.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,At least Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with wildness and wit. Costner's stolid hero seems a washout by comparison.
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,"Though Waterworld has some haunting underwater visual moments, the film's impact is weakened by flat dialogue, an overemphasis on jokeyness and a plot that, despite all those screenwriters, does not satisfactorily hold together at any number of points."
Waterworld,6.2,88246220,50,This movie feels like it was made by a bank rather than a person.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,80,"The stylish and engrossing reinterpretation of the mythological king's early years lacks character development, but makes up for it with swashbuckling, sword-fighting, beast-slaying fun."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,75,"With Legend of the Sword, the filmmaker isn’t remaking or adapting anything. This is his version of Arthur’s origin story and, if nothing else, it’s kinetic and attention-grabbing."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,75,"In its finest moments, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is swift and clever and exhilarating. At its low points, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword plays like a cheesy B-movie, with ridiculous monsters and unintentionally laugh-inducing moments."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,70,"King Arthur wants desperately to please, and it mostly succeeds."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,67,"Ritchie’s ‘King Arthur’ is a pleasing big budget spectacle, oddly aligned to the filmmaker’s thematic interests and startlingly compatible with his signature razzle-dazzle style. In fact, the soggiest moments in the movie are the ones that adhere the closest to that ambitious multi-film strategy, lessening the fun, and emptying its impact."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,63,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a fun, if sacrilegious, first step in a franchise creation — one that observes the first commandment of storytelling: Thou shalt not be boring."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,60,"Put your fingers in your ears when the talking starts, and you might enjoy the view."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,60,"Ritchie’s film is at all times over the top, crashing around its digital landscapes in all manner of beserkness, sometimes whooshing along, sometimes stuck in the odd narrative doldrum. But it is often surprisingly entertaining, and whatever clunkers he has delivered in the past, Ritchie again shows that a film-maker of his craft and energy commands attention."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"Sure, it doesn’t always work — mainly due to some bad writing, shoddy visual effects, and tonal oddities —  but when King Arthur: Legend of the Sword finds its stride, it’s a neat little tincture of Snatchian attitude and fantasy lore that is a good bit of early summer fun."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"Ritchie is so adept that the film is compulsively watchable, but it’s watchable in the same way as a massive train wreck or the slow-motion demolition of a high-rise."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,"The franchise-hungry tentpole-itis of the present studio model has produced oh-so-many dumb rehashes of classic myths and fairy tales, but this is the first that is always funny on purpose."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,58,King Arthur could have been a rollicking blast. Instead it’s just another wannabe blockbuster with too much flash and not enough soul.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,55,"There are quick cuts and CG imagery and bro-ing out in nearly equal proportions; I found some of this excess to be heady and exciting, but by the end of the film’s running time, it all became a bit tiresome, to say nothing of tiring."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Some might find it stimulating. Others will find it bonkers. Watching Jude Law do a slow-motion howl, for example, is certainly … something."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword isn't a movie as much as a feature length montage of bastardized lore and rejected Game of Thrones pitches.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Arthur and Vortigern mix it up amid a lot of shenanigans, detours and filler, some bad, some good and all of it disposable."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Unfortunately, “Arthur” is rarely at its best, bogged down in countless CGI sequences of battlefields or monsters."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"There are some fun bits in the film. Law is kind of funny, in and over-the-top, does-he-mean-to-be-like-this way. Hunnam is game for playing Arthur. But Ritchie, in his attempt to ensure there’s never a dull moment, makes it all exhausting."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"King Arthur is neither Guy Ritchie’s worst film nor his best, but it might well be his most frustrating. A compendium of all the things that make the British director so occasionally exciting and so often irritating, this new, hyper-stylized take on the Arthurian legends veers between genius and idiocy."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,Legend of the Sword’s overemphasis on the supernatural and the visually spectacular mortally wounds an often-rollicking adventure.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"In all honesty, the rat-a-tat repartee and tasty touches of Classic pre-Madonna Ritchie don’t excuse a bastardization that takes forever to get on its feet, that lacks the requisite love story (Ritchie and his “boys will be boys” pictures), that presents too much of Angle-land as a burnt-out pit quarry, that revels in anachronisms."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"Commercial considerations strangle the vitality from the movie, but Ritchie does his best to bring a bit of impish wit to the proceedings."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,"From one moment to the next, it's possible to on some level enjoy the shaking up of tired conventions in a swordplay fantasy such as this and then to be dismayed by the lowbrow vulgarity of what's ended up onscreen. The film gives with one hand and takes away with the other, which can be frustrating in what's meant to be an entertainment."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,50,A bloated action movie with occasional breaks in the monotony. It’s Perfectly Fine™; entirely competent but unexceptional in just about every way.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,45,"The most frustrating thing about Ritchie's take on King Arthur is that it has all the necessary elements to be a great version of the story, but rather than giving them to the audience as such, they are put into a blender and thoroughly mixed."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,42,"Part “Game of Thrones,” part “Snatch,” and almost all bad, Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is one of those generic blockbusters that has nothing to say and no idea how to say it."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Somehow hectic and lumbering, diverting and dispiriting all at once, this mud-toned medieval pulp largely cleaves to the spirit of Ritchie’s “Sherlock Holmes” series, reducing a fabled figure of British lore to two hours of tough-guy swagger and head-pounding digital thwackery."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"It's all more wearying than fun. Except for Law, whose courtly sangfroid can elevate even the dumbest roles."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,The story never drags – it’s too frenetically paced for that – but it’s still kind of a drag.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Although it flickers to life at times, King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword devolves into a jumbled affair, weighed down by confusing supernatural elements and a lazy reliance on visual effects."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"This is a tonal misfire, its characters cut down by a blitzkrieg of whip pans, CGI and thunderous percussion. And with Ritchie again rummaging in his increasingly threadbare bag of tricks, the result is a movie more jaundiced than jaunty."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Ultimately, “King Arthur” is just a loud, obnoxious parade of flashy set pieces, as one visually busy, belligerent action scene after another marches by, each making less sense than the last, but all intended to overwhelm."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Excitement is fleeting, dialogue rambles and Jude Law’s tyrant-approved throne slouch pretty much sums the film’s overall attitude – a hearty “meh,” worthy of no diamond-studded crown."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,40,"Ritchie’s film...is so misshapen and inert, your imagination and memory never come close to being sparked by it. Just sticking with the plot soaks up every ounce of concentration you have."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,The result is an oxymoron: a frenetic slog. That’s unfortunately what happens to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” lumbers on for more than two hours, weighed down with oversized elephants, excessively populated action sequences, and weirdly sudden occurrence of slow motion, as if the film is yawning."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,38,"Optimism is nowhere to be found in Ritchie's movie itself. It is a grim and stupid thing, from one of the world's most successful mediocre filmmakers, and if Shakespeare's King Lear were blogging today, he'd supply the blurb quote: ""Nothing will come of nothing."""
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,37,"King Arthur has a vulnerable heart beating somewhere under all the grimy, sweaty muscles lovingly displayed for the camera. It’s just buried too often under narrative chaos, and the inexplicable ideal that if a story runs at double speed and triple energy, the gaping holes in the story will outpace anyone’s notice."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,33,What we really get is a film made of utter nonsense that’s even less interested in its characters than it is in telling a story.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,30,This latest retelling of the ancient Arthurian myth is a stinker for the ages.
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,30,"King Arthur is guilty of many blockbuster sins critics have taken it upon themselves to call out over the last decade. And yet, seeing a version of them this derivative and dumb, with neither CGI grandeur nor a sense of fun on its side, is like a splash of cold water in the face, a reminder of how bad things can be when nobody cares."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"Ritchie aspires to be a great British director, but his working his way through British icons — Sherlock Holmes wasn’t even safe — does no one any good. He just reduces them to his own vernacular, his own level, and he ends up revealing nothing about them and everything about his own narrow vision."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"An epic bore that believes if you make a movie long and loud and repetitive enough, audiences will conclude it's saying something profound. Wrong."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is stupid enough to send you back to the one movie that did the saga right by ripping it to shreds, 1975’s “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”"
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,6.8,39175066,25,"For all the attempts to update King Arthur to be cool and sexy, neither the character nor the film around him musters any spark."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,80,"As spectacular as you’d hope from a sequel to the 1996 planet-toaster, and as amusingly cheesy. You’ll enjoy yourself enough that you won’t even miss Will Smith."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,70,"Resurgence doles out the action and effects work in carefully calculated, incremental doses, which give the film a cumulative tension. Even if it’s hokey and jokey, this is a loud, effects-driven piece, with a driving score. For fans of Roland Emmerich disaster movies, this both hits all the marks, while delivering nothing new."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,Both impossible to take seriously or seriously dislike.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,"The main thing consumers will be looking for from Resurgence is bang-for-buck entertainment, and that it delivers reasonably successfully."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,This cinematic Big Mac entertains abundantly on its own second-hand merits.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,60,"It’s all too much too fast, and the cumulative effect is like watching a two-hour trailer – more dizzying than thrilling."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,58,Resurgence ends up falling victim to its attempts to differentiate itself while remaining completely derivative.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,58,"Despite all this, Independence Day: Resurgence still emerges as one of the better blockbusters of this summer, and that’s only halfway damning with faint praise. It’s a mess, but I grinned a good portion of the way through."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,55,"The spaceships and the destruction are bigger but not better in Roland Emmerich‘s twenty-years-later follow-up, where only Jeff Goldblum‘s sense of humor saves the day."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"No surprise, then, that Goldblum seems a little lonely and marooned in the latest venture, which suffers from a nagging case of Smithlessness."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,Tarnishes the image of its predecessor but the original Independence Day wasn’t all that good to begin with.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"The disaster sequences themselves — of which there are many, placed at regular intervals but disconnected from the story, like operatic arias — have a dreamlike and weirdly exhilarating quality that’s quite different from the plodding wham-bam destruction of the average action blockbuster."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,50,"While the plot is dumb and the script is worse, watching aliens explode in spectacular fashion isn't the worst excuse to spend to two hours in air-conditioning."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,42,Fails both as a film and even as fan service.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,Lacks both the iconic heft of its predecessor's imagery as well as any sense of character development.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"Goldblum manages to rise above the proceedings via his invisible jetpack of dry wit — thank God for that. The only newcomer who emerges unscathed is Gainsbourg, who glides through this mess with Zen equanimity—even as chaos reigns, she keeps her cool."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,Laughably bad dialogue and wooden acting.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"This isn’t just lazy, it’s borderline nonsensical. Resurgence inflates the scale of the alien threat to such a preposterous degree – the mothership takes up roughly an eighth of the Earth’s total surface – that the queues of honking traffic and rooftop helicopter rescues we’re supposed to invest in can’t help but feel like microscopic trifles."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,40,"This might have been titled ‘Independence Day: Submergence’. It’s certainly hard not to drown in the sea of CGI, with the exponential increase of pixels being to Independence Day what the Star Wars prequels were to the original trilogy."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"The movie must be bad, right? Worse, it’s a bore."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,This is a disaster by committee.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"It’s just dull and hollow — a massive waste of time and money. The characters are flimsy, the dialogue is stilted and the amount of destruction is ridiculous."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"Independence Day: Resurgence pretends there's fresh ground to cover. There isn't, but director Roland Emmerich makes a good show of faking it."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,"Independence Day: Resurgence is all big effects, big explosions, epic battles rendered in state-of-the-art strokes. But really bad writing, achingly bad acting, groaning scenes and a serious lack of suspense and surprise all add up to zero fun, this time around."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,38,Ridiculousness needs to abound somewhat in a film like this — reality takes a seat early and often here — but Resurgence pushes everything to an egregiously over-the-top and often infuriating degree.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,33,"There’s no heart in this movie, no urgency."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"Honestly, I could watch Goldblum and Gainsbourg – two of the most quirkily sublime multihypenate artists alive – reading phonebooks to each other and enjoy the experience thoroughly, but sadly even they seem wasted here."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"The lackluster, at times abysmal writing wouldn’t much matter if Resurgence popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"While the first ""Independence Day"" was genuinely big, dumb fun, its sequel only manages to be a bigger, dumber bore."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,30,"Independence Day: Resurgence is a bad movie, occasionally in ways that are good for a chuckle, like when people earnestly deliver lines like “Now listen up! They’re going for our molten core!” but mostly just bad in ways that make you wish you hadn’t wasted your money or your time."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,A curiously loud and ugly beast of a sequel.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"The sequel is even more silly, and much less fun."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"I saw Resurgence an hour and a half ago, and I feel like an alien wiped my memory clean already."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,25,"The first “Independence Day’’ was a lot of fun, with a great lines and cutting-edge special effects. It was much imitated, so the sequel plays like a faded, eighth-generation copy with a cast that’s shooting blanks when it comes to humor."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,20,This hodgepodge has been thrown together in so slovenly a way that it’s no surprise the studio didn’t show it to the press.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,20,"Joyless and tedious, a reboot quite without the first film’s audacity and fun... It’s a movie that is going through the intergalactic motions."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,16,An immaculate case-study in how far blockbusters have fallen.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,"One of the most aggressively stupid blockbusters ever made, a painful exercise in Hollywood greed and artistic incompetence on every level."
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,Disposable and shockingly inept.
Independence Day: Resurgence,5.2,103144286,0,"Emmerich rewards our patience with an impersonally massive set piece involving the usual generic stew of mass CGI-imagined demolition. The insensitivity displayed toward human life in these sequences would be galling even by Emmerich's standards, if this pitiful albatross of corporate capitalism could work up enough energy to be offensive."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"The Revenant is every bit as technically proficient as Inarritu's ""Birdman,"" a film that made critics swoon with its masterful handling of the filmmaker's daring ""one-take"" conceit. It manages, however, to do it without the same gimmicky feel."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"Boldly original, The Revenant puts everything else playing at the multiplexes in the shade."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"The Revenant is an action blockbuster with an art house soul, a headlong rush of motion with meaning. Pure cinema from Iñárritu and Lubezki, two undisputed masters working at their peaks."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"The Revenant is a visceral sensation, filled with unforgettable visuals and memorable set pieces."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"A riveting saga of pain, grit and the brute moral relativism of revenge, the first law of all, and the only one that mattered back then. The Revenant is one of the best pictures of the year."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,DiCaprio’s performance is an astonishing testament to his commitment to a role.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"A cold, visceral, and overwhelming piece of cinema."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,DiCaprio's raw performance helps elevate what could have been just another man-versus-nature drama.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"Astounding. With a director, DoP and cast at the top of their game, The Revenant is a filmmaking triumph."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"Pushing both brutal realism and extravagant visual poetry to the edges of what one customarily finds in mainstream American filmmaking, director/co-writer Alejandro G. Inarritu, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and a vast team of visual effects wizards have created a sensationally vivid and visceral portrait of human endurance under very nearly intolerable conditions."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,100,"What is so distinctive about this Iñárritu picture is its unitary control and its fluency: no matter how extended, the film’s tense story is under the director’s complete control and he unspools great meandering, bravura travelling shots to tell it: not dissimilar, in some ways, to his previous picture, Birdman. The movie is as thrilling and painful as a sheet of ice held to the skin."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,95,"Is the relentlessness too much? At two and a half hours, perhaps, but inventiveness abounds."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,91,"It is as impressive as any movie released this year, but the storytelling falters in some fundamental ways that keep me from completely adoring it. Innaritu dreams big, and he has the muscle to back it up. The Revenant may not be his best film yet, but it's hard to imagine many filmmakers who are working at a higher level than he is these days."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,90,"What elevates this standard, if relentless, plot line is that The Revenant feels like high-wire work without a net."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,90,"If you can work up interest in such meager material, the film is a chilling, stirring, experiential immersion in what life-and-death drama might actually feel like."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,88,The Revenant is exhilarating cinema.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,88,"The fact that the last line of dialogue is spoken five minutes before the end credits roll is telling: Words matter little in a movie that favors seeing and feeling above all else. It’s a work of pure, furious sensation."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,88,"In a year when no fewer than five films have dealt with themes of man vs. nature and survival (including The Martian, Everest, In the Heart of the Sea, and A Walk in the Woods), The Revenant is by far the most brutal, challenging, and astounding of these."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,88,The Revenant is the most intense thing you’ll enjoy over the holidays this side of family dinners.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,88,"You could gripe about the excess of carnage and lack of philosophical substance. But surviving nature is Iñárritu's subject, and he delivers with magisterial brilliance."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,88,"Our favorite films often drop questions like these into our lives, allowing us to appreciate the world a little differently than before we saw them. The Revenant has this power. It lingers. It hangs in the back of your mind like the best classic parables of man vs. nature. It will stay there for quite some time."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,83,"Though it may feel threadbare for some, Iñárritu’s near exhausting movie is still unforgettably visceral and there’s so much to be dazzled and experientially shaken by."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"The combined exceptional work of star Leonardo DiCaprio and nonpareil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki create so much verisimilitude and beauty that it compels us to pay more attention to this glimpse of a dark, unsettling kill-or-be-killed world."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"Mr. Iñárritu isn’t content to merely seduce you with ecstatic beauty and annihilating terror; he wants to blow your mind, to amp up your art-house experience with blockbusterlike awesomeness."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"That grim realism sometimes makes The Revenant about as appetizing as a three-course meal of turkey jerky — but also serious enough to remind you of classics like ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and ""Little Big Man."" It's a gruesome adventure story that rarely lets up."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"While the style may outpace the substance, that doesn't make the style any less magnificent. And when it comes to sheer customer satisfaction, The Revenant checks nearly every box, up to and including the man vs. wild throwdown. It just makes a jarring, memorable statement about how often the wild is likely to win that uneven fight."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"I’m not sure The Revenant is quite as tough and uncompromising as it thinks it is: it's coffee-table existentialism, with psychological brush-strokes so thick they might as well have been put on with a mop. But there’s no question it’s an extraordinary, blood-summoning, sinew-stiffening ride."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"This brutal survival tale is so powerfully engrossing that, despite the clear limitations of his monochromatic, showy approach, the film’s compelling construction tends to override the legitimate criticisms."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,80,"What makes this more than just a punishing, fearful, expertly crafted thriller focused on one man’s endurance is heavily down to Emmanuel Lubezki’s attractive, thoughtful photography."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,78,"The most punishing movie of 2015, The Revenant, is almost as brutal an experience for the viewer to watch as it is for its title character Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) to undergo. That’s not meant as a knock, but rather as a warning that the film may leave you as near-speechless and mono-minded as its battered returnee from the dead."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,75,Iñárritu has his eye so firmly on the myths of America that he loses sight of the men who made them. But he’s hardly the first person to do that.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,75,"I might be tempted to vote DiCaprio best actor — or at least to propose a new category be inaugurated, the acting equivalent of the Purple Heart."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,75,"A film I admired, but didn’t especially like, The Revenant is a master class in craftsmanship, marrying the ethos of 1970s Hollywood, with its beaten-dog heroes forever roughed up by a brutal system, to the technological prowess of today’s digitally obsessed blockbusters."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,75,"There’s a sense that the whole doesn’t quite equal the sum of the parts, no matter how spectacular some of them are."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,75,"Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Iñárritu’s savage endurance test of a film almost works better as a series of stunning images and surreal sequences than as an emotionally satisfying story."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,75,No amount of ingenious camerawork and breakneck pacing can obscure a simplistic core.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,70,"Its scale and ambition at times makes it seem like more than it is: a survival story. There’s nothing wrong with that, and it’s a good one. It’s just not a whole lot more."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,70,"The hitch with tales of endurance, onscreen, is their unfortunate habit of becoming endurance tests for the viewer, and, after a while, The Revenant turns into a slog. Make no mistake, it’s a very beautiful slog. Emmanuel Lubezki’s cinematography summons a wealth of wonders."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,70,"The Revenant is supposed to be relentless, though you may find it tiresome, the movie equivalent of tigers circling a tree so single-mindedly that they churn themselves into butter."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,67,"What The Revenant attempts but fails to do is create a larger vision from all this survivalist mayhem. It’s a useful how-to guide for how to stay alive after a bear attack – or a human attack, for that matter – but it doesn’t soar. It crawls."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,63,"That first hour is big, and imposing. The rest grows smaller, with the script's self-conscious deeper meanings either layered on top, like pelts, or — more successfully — left to Luzbeki's meticulous images of a sun-dappled 19th century Eden now home to one too many Wal-Mart stores."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,60,Though there's an awful lot to be admired - not least an enormously impressive soundscape - The Revenant ultimately lacks the nerve-jangling thrills or the spiritual resonance that it strives for.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,60,"I think The Revenant is, on the whole, pain without gain, but it’s certainly a tour ​de force — literally, a feat of strength."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,60,"In aiming to steer his dark, fatalistic vision toward something genuinely contemplative and cathartic, Inarritu has managed to appropriate the beauty of Malick’s filmmaking but none of its sublimity — another word for which might be humility. There is plenty of amazement here, to be sure, but all too little in the way of grace."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,50,"However good DiCaprio may be, everything else feels overblown."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,50,"Despite the literal and figurative pains it takes to persuade viewers of its own importance, The Revenant can’t escape the clutches of crippling self-regard."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,50,If Iñárritu wanted to show how life on the frontier was miserable and monotonous he succeeded — by making a movie that is miserable and monotonous. Some of the greatest cinematography in history can’t change that fact.
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,40,"I came out of this would-be epic feeling physically exhausted, psychically mauled and none the better for wear."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,40,"For a while, at least, this one feels like Iñárritu’s masterpiece, until that familiar too-muchness begins to take over."
The Revenant,8.0,183637894,38,"What pushes the film, at long last, into the icy river, is its very design, as a monument to slick, mercenary grandeur."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,100,"There’s a brisk sense of invention to the film, and it feels like it is breathlessly told, something that is due in large part to Justin Lin, who has been developing a very particular approach to blockbuster filmmaking. Yes, he’s fine with the big action mayhem that is par for the course with these films, but he understands that the thing that makes any of it interesting is making sure the audience really enjoys spending time with these characters."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,83,"Lin siphons elements of his previous gig into this one. More precisely, he accentuates the existing ""family"" dynamic of Star Trek, leading to genuinely earned lumps in Trekker throats."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,83,I do hope there will be many more future installments. I’d like to spend more time with these folks.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,83,"Star Trek Beyond is a vast improvement from the sloppy Into Darkness, bringing it on par with the excellent ’09 reboot in terms of sheer quality and chemistry."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"It’s not just a blast but, at moments, a thing of beauty, alive to the comic awesomeness of being lost in space."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"Star Trek Beyond may not go where no Trek has gone before, but it’s that very fidelity to the show’s original values that will keep fans trekking to the box office."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"It’s better to have a well-made, unapologetic action-adventure like this one than a creepy stab at replication."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,This movie isn’t just fun; it’s sincere and sweet and downright inspiring.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"Lin keeps this tense adventure (co-written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg, who also reprises his role as chief engineer Scotty) from stumbling over its own excess: he knows that any good Star Trek needs wit as well as spectacle."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"It's not only filled with the usual special-effects eye candy, but smart, fan-focused writing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"This is all fun all the time, a dizzying carnival of wisecracks, fisticuffs, explosions, chases and truly eye-popping effects."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling The Wrath of Khan as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,80,"A return to fun, and a return to form for the new version of the old Trek. The 13th Trek movie is also the second good odd-numbered instalment in a row. Lucky for some."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"With Lin at the helm, and the Enterprise crew reimagined as a family unit in the mold of Dom Toretto’s gang, the movie bounces along, hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity, pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Pine brings a measured but engaging heroism to Kirk. Quinto is perfect as the logical but charismatic Spock. Urban lends the proceedings a much appreciated dose of humor. And even with his famously expressive face obscured by makeup, Elba elevates Krall to something more than a cardboard villain."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Despite the futuristic tilt in the title, Star Trek Beyond works best when it boldly goes retro."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Star Trek Beyond plays like an episode of the old “Star Trek” TV series. This, I submit, is what’s enjoyable about it."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Sometimes silly, outlandish, and sentimental in its fan service-y callbacks, Star Trek Beyond and its sense of entertaining urgency often trumps its insubstantial qualities, as illogical as that may be."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"It may not boldly go where no “Star Trek” film has gone before, but it gets there at warp speed, and with a full tank of fresh ideas."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Even with its big-screen pyrotechnics and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series, and I mean that in the best possible way."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"Happily, Star Trek Beyond is much more than a mere refresh. Thanks to Lin’s steady directorial hand and knack for visualizing improbable set-pieces, the new film is bold, breathless and propulsive, a distillation of the action movie to its purest elements."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"The latest, produced by Abrams and directed by ""Fast and Furious"" alum Justin Lin, isn't quite up to the 2009 and 2013 movies. But it's still fun, you still care about the people and the effects manage to look a little more elegant and interesting than the usual blue blasts of generica."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,75,"This episode cuts right to the core of the series’s original appeal, giving the terrific cast a chance to play against one another in a straightforward story. It’s not exactly bold, but “Beyond” does satisfy."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"The film may not go boldly, but it’s a welcome homecoming for the beloved series."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,Star Trek Beyond is better than not-bad. By any earthly standard it’s good.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"Fun but in a careful way, the film lasts just two hours, but it can seem much longer than that."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"It’s a knowing nod to the past fused with a contemporary cast confident in the present, and where the franchise might take it in the future."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"The third instalment of the re-booted Star Trek franchise gets safely through its voyage, offering a strong returning cast and a familiar, if slightly tweaked mix of effects-heavy space action, cheeky humour and philosophical musing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"It’s a sturdily built movie that gets the job done, and it’s got a likable retro vibe."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,70,"Star Trek Beyond might be the Star Trekkiest film of the new, J.J. Abrams–ified Trek era. That is to say, it's the one that feels the most like a turbo-loaded episode of the original series, and has at least some of that classic spirit of exploration and derring-do."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,68,"Star Trek: Beyond does have a strength that its two reboot predecessors lacked: it puts the focus squarely on the larger Trek ensemble, rather than solely on Kirk and his relationships."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,67,The rebooted Star Trek film series finally hits a fun median between big-budget bombast and classic Trek bigheartedness with Star Trek Beyond.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,67,"If Star Trek Beyond existed outside the arena of reboots and sequels that mandated its existence, the movie’s casual air might be downright radical for such an extensive production. Instead, it’s just a sturdy riff on the same old routine."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,The movie never delivers on its considerable promise because it's always in such a hurry to get to the next action scene.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"The plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"There is plenty in Star Trek Beyond for diehard Trekkers to enjoy, and director Justin Lin (Fast & Furious) guns the action sequences."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"Stark Trek Beyond emphasizes the inter-personal dynamics of the USS Enterprise, and functions best as an extended team-building exercise."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,Pandering? Yes. But pandering with polish.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,63,"The galactic adventure might be an uneven one, but the combination of gravitas, a little mirth and old-school Trek themes makes Beyond a decently entertaining trip to the final frontier."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"The nerd in me wants a bit more rigor, a bit more plausibility underneath the exuberant fakery. Maybe in the next episode."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"In fairness to Beyond, it makes very few promises it can't keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"Justin Lin proves a safe pair of hands at the helm of the Enterprise. Powered by a spirited sense of adventure and a nice teamwork dynamic, it’s fun, but not essential, summer viewing."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,60,"This new movie could arguably have given Elba more to do, earlier in the picture, but it is the inter-relationship of the Enterprise’s crew which is the real source of drama. An entertaining adventure."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,58,"Beyond is more fun than deep. It’s lightweight, zero-gravity Trek that is, for the most part, devoid of the sort of Big Ideas and knotty existential questions that creator Gene Roddenberry specialized in."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,50,"Freed from reality, Lin turns into a kid gifted a box of markers and glitter: Everything is manic and distracting. There’s a cool swoosh where the lens surfs behind the Enterprise as it accelerates through a tube, but mostly the tricks are garish."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,50,Action scenes are so chaotically edited it’s often difficult to figure out who’s bashing and crashing into whom.
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,50,"With Star Trek Beyond, the rebooted “Star Trek” franchise that features the original crew of the Enterprise, settles into routine sequel territory. This isn’t terrible news, and it may have been inevitable, but it’s something of a letdown all at the same."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,38,They should have called it “Star Trek Into Drowsiness.”
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,30,"Lin’s F&F films are operatically dumb, which was what makes them so much fun; maybe if Star Trek Beyond were stupider it wouldn’t feel like such a chore."
Star Trek Beyond,7.1,158848340,20,"If you go out into the furthest reaches of Star Trek's filmography today, you're in for an unsettling discovery: the final frontier looks oddly familiar. It's brightly coloured eye-bait, Jim, exactly as we know it - outpacing your visual field in an attempt to convince you that something exciting is going on."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,80,"An obligatory setup for a sequel slows down the final moments, but until then, Tomb Raider feels like a perfectly paced trio of espresso shots, with a shot of adrenaline to the heart as a chaser."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,75,Much better and more original than anyone could have expected.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,75,Director Roar Uthaug (“The Wave”) delivers a state-of-the-art popcorn flick that’s at its best when the focus is on the spunky Lara rather than the special effects.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,75,"Uthaug also manages to work in a few genuinely cool visual tricks, though the dialogue, from a serviceable script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons is strictly standard; a mix of clunky action-movie exposition and winking Indiana Jones-style humor."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"This movie is a smooch-free zone, and the arc described by its leading lady, proud and nerveless, is an elegant one: she starts by taking a punch to the face, without malice, from another woman, and, at the climax, delivers one herself—unmanning her male opponent with a decisive thump to the groin. If Lara Croft weren’t already a role model, she is now."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"The fights and chases are well designed. You can always tell where everything is in relation to everything else and who’s hitting or shooting whom — which isn’t a given, surprisingly, when fast cutting and loudness can cover a lot of infelicities."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"It's hardly the first or last time Hollywood has plundered one of its own long-dormant properties, but it's also a reminder that not every resurrection has to feel like a desecration."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,70,"The movie is full of vine-swinging, bow-and-arrow-shooting, ancient-spirit-meeting action, but most of it is staged on a convincing human scale, one that’s been expertly tailored to its star’s understated directness."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,67,"This new iteration of Ms. Croft, played in a far more realistic fashion by Vikander (of Ex Machina fame), is somewhat more serious in tone, but altogether more fun to watch."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,67,"Vikander is a beautifully effective avatar for the American Ninja Warrior version of Lara Croft. Stripping down the bombast of the original games (and films) allows Uthaug’s reboot to feel comparatively grounded and immediate, without dragging itself down with unnecessary pathos."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Tomb Raider may be the most faithful adaptation of a video game to-date. Unfortunately, faithfulness to the source material doesn’t always result in the best cinematic experience and this is one of those occasions."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Tomb Raider may be a less camp, more cunning take on the arts and Crofts that have made the brand a hit, but to call this a better-than average videogame movie is to damn it with faint praise. Don't hate the players. Hate the genre."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Vikander doesn’t have much to play, script-wise, but she makes a tough, appealing action star."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,63,"Tomb Raider is an often fun and visually compelling action pic, that is also sometimes unintentionally silly, with a great actress leading the whole thing."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"I admire the seriousness with which everyone involved treats these characters, and the smart ways that the script (from Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons) on several occasions dashes expectations to the rocks. I have hopes for a sequel."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"Tomb Raider, by merely being an OK video-game film, is a great step in the right direction for the struggling genre. It seems that Uthaug got most of the dreary, expositional stuff out of the way early, so hopefully these oncoming sequels will take a hint and give audiences more of what they want."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"Alicia Vikander makes for a scrappy, spunky Lara Croft, even if the overall concept remains less a movie and more of an exercise routine."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"For all of Tomb Raider’s strengths, it would still be a stretch to call it a good movie. It’s diverting, a good way to spend a couple of hours, but it’s hamstrung by something that’s unavoidable: The whole central concept — raiding tombs — is just, well, not that interesting."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"More than the sets or spectacle, Vikander pulls you into her picture, as if we’ve signed up for a special edition of the game where Lara Croft has only one life to spare, one go to get it right. It’s not rocket science, just an elementary way to make us sit up and care."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,"Norway’s Roar Uthaug (The Wave) directs it straight up, without even a twist of humour, bouncing Vikander from set piece to set piece with no real attempt at coherent plotting in-between. Yet Vikander is so watchable as the video-game-made-flesh, and the low-fi chase sequences can be so exciting, it’s almost enough. Almost."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,60,Vikander packs a punch but this Tomb Raider is a long way off the Holy Grail of the first three Indy movies.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,58,"When Tomb Raider digs into its more creative action, it’s about as entertaining as popcorn entertainment gets these days. It’s when the film falls back on the old tropes that things grind to a halt."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,58,"Vikander doesn’t do much with a character whose chief attribute is earnestness, but Tomb Raider improves once it gets to the island and lets the derring-do take over."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,55,Tomb Raider fails to develop interesting characters or motives but at least offers viewers some fun action.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,55,"Since the genre of video games-turned-into-feature films has inflicted some real doozies on audiences, Tomb Raider towers above most of its peers by being merely OK. By any other measure, this is a saga of fits and starts, and we can only hope for smoother sailing if the film inspires the sequels it clearly hopes to engender."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Tomb Raider, sloppily directed by Roar Uthaug, would not be worth watching without Vikander, who darts, leaps, and pummels her way through this mediocre escapade with a winning fierceness that makes you wish she had paired up with Indiana Jones in his heyday."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Vikander, who can balance flinty charm with sympathetic humanism, helped keep me invested, but Tomb Raider could best be described as a solid step forward, away from past wrongs. I’ll take competence over silliness, but the Lara Croft brand still has a long way to go before her movies are truly memorable."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Outside of Vikander’s performance, Tomb Raider tends to go on autopilot, either too scared or uninspired to reimagine this blah action-adventure material."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"The emotional underpinnings of the story feel incomplete, to the extent that the film is too busy with death-defying survival scenes and pointed guns to truly reckon with Lara’s abandonment as a child."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Vikander is in nearly every scene in the movie, and she’s absolutely terrific. Endearing and funny in the early scenes in London, easy to root for as she dives into the cartoon of an adventure. Of course Tomb Raider sets the table for future adventures, but if the future chapters are to be this silly and disposable, one hopes Vikander moves on as quickly from this film as I did as a viewer."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Like the personality-devoid video-game version of Croft, Vikander’s take is bland. Like the game, the movie develops her skills and stamina more than her personality, leaving Croft to be a kind of blank slate so viewers can attach their own identity. While that works in games because characters are avatars for players, Uthaug’s apparent use of a similar technique here is tedious."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"The action set pieces are hit and miss, mostly not the worst thing I’ve ever seen, and if there’s one thing Tomb Raider is actually good at, it’s giving death more gravity than you usually see in these kinds of movies, where faceless henchmen are dispatched with nary a second thought. For the most part, though, Tomb Raider is content to be the kind of movie that reminds you of other movies without differentiating itself from them."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"When it comes to what should be the reliably dumb fun of tomb raiding, maybe there are worse crimes than insulting viewers’ intelligence or bombarding them with crappy special effects. Boring them? Now that’s a felony offense."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,The Lara Croft reboot Tomb Raider isn’t half bad for an hour. Then there’s another hour. That hour is quite bad.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,50,"Lara’s appealing enough in humor and drive but Vikander brings deeper notes than the script and green screens require, from sorrow and fear to first-kill horror. Tomb Raider isn’t a place to expect good acting even from an Oscar winner, but Vikander persists."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,All the action leads inexorably toward the unavoidable destination.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"It’s a different kind of Tomb Raider, certainly. But for an adventure film, it’s disconcertingly dull."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"Brandishing impressively packed abs and enough upper body strength to pull herself out of countless jams, Alicia Vikander gamely steps into the kick-ass role twice played by Angelina Jolie, but the derivative story and cardboard supporting characters are straight out of 1930s movie serials."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"Too bad the new actress doesn’t bring much to the party, and this “origin story” feels like leftovers."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,"To her credit, Vikander works hard and looks the part. She also has some chemistry with Daniel Wu, who plays the guy who helps Lara get to the island and then sort of becomes her sidekick.... By the standards of video game movies, Tomb Raider is not terrible, but by the standards of video game movies Plan 9 From Outer Space is practically an Oscar winner."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,40,Throughout Vikander maintains a kind of serene evenness of manner. Blandness is Lara’s theme.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,"After a brisk and promising opening half-hour set in London and Hong Kong, the movie devolves into a Saturday matinee B-movie, and not in a good way. It’s pure product, and a waste of a savvy leading actress."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,A film so rife with plot holes that it would make a decent pasta strainer.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,"Alicia Vikander worked herself into hardbody shape for Tomb Raider, which by contrast is a flabby, lazy mess."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,38,"When your set pieces fail to surprise, your dialogue fails to deliver even one decent one-liner and your villain looks like he’s dealing with dysentery on location, maybe 17-18 years isn’t long enough between reboots."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,37,"Norwegian director Roar Uthaug has had past success with nail-biting suspense, as in his well-received 2015 disaster movie “The Wave.” He can’t quite replicate that same tension here, however. Watching a tiny-but-tough woman survive one danger after another tests not only our credulity, but our patience."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,30,"While I wasn’t exactly expecting greatness from the film, I did think it would contain a few thrills and maybe some laughs. Having Lara Croft leap around and avoid traps should be an easy formula—but for this crew, it remains an unsolvable puzzle."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,30,"There are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and Tomb Raider goes wrong in many of the most obvious: It has a generic story, bad writing, a miscast lead, the wrong director and no fun."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,25,"Story problems tank the new Tomb Raider — small, essential things like lack of motivation, lack of reasons for people to do the things they do, and lack of any reason for the audience to keep watching."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,25,"Unexceptionally directed by Roar Uthaug (Norwegian hit “The Wave“), Tomb Raider is superficial even for a mainstream tentpole, clumsily and unpersuasively put together and tests and breaks suspension of disbelief at every turn."
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,25,This isn’t an adaptation of a video game so much as an adaptation of a video game’s tutorial level.
Tomb Raider,6.3,57421715,10,"Ms. Vikander has leapt into the void of a franchise reboot, based on a video-game reboot, that generates no joy, makes negligible sense, and seals its own tomb with a climax of perfect absurdity."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,80,"If you’re not staggered by the technique on display here – the stuff that sets Bay’s work miles above the Fast & Furiouses, X-Men: Apocalypses and Tom Cruise-chasing Mummies of this world – you’re not paying attention."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,75,It’s been reported that this “Transformers” sequel had a $217 million budget. The special effects — especially in IMAX 3-D — on the screen make you believe it.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,60,"Clangorous and nonsensical, the fifth installment of the toys-to-world-saviors franchise still has a spark of grandeur that could only come from one director."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,60,"For the first time, the messy hyperactive form and nihilistic crunched-metal content seem to reinforce each other."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,58,"Monster metal, mass destruction, Anthony Hopkins saying “dude.” This is your brain on Michael Bay—a cortex scramble so amped on pyro and noise and brawling cyborgs it can only process what’s happening on screen in onomatopoeia: Clang! Pew-pew! Kablooey!"
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,Bay makes a lot of familiar moves here.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"The absolute tastelessness of Bay’s images, their stultifying service to platitudes and to merchandise, doesn’t at all diminish their wildly imaginative power."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"If the film’s trio of new screenwriters (replacing series mainstay Ehren Kruger) have seamlessly upheld the crass and juvenile “Transformers” sensibility, then Bay’s visual sensibility has, if anything, matured, to the point of demanding and earning your exasperated surrender."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"The more striking moments of The Last Knight—this is an ostentatious Michael Bay movie, after all—speak just as loudly to its director’s indifference to both source material and visual scale."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"It’s an unabashed freewheeling mess of CGI explosions, fast-talking strategies and shiny metal monstrosities clashing in epic battles. And it’s actually kind of fun, in an infuriating sort of way, to watch the most ridiculous Hollywood movie of the year do its thing."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,This film’s sense of action geography and tactics is atrocious.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,It's the little pleasures in mediocre movies that mean a lot.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,50,"The fifth Transformers movie, The Last Knight, is far from the worst in this continuing experiment in noisy nonsense based on Hasbro toys. That is thanks largely to two words: Anthony Hopkins."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,43,"It’s beautiful, bombastic, and nearly indistinguishable from those that came before it."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"Bay’s genuine determination to give you a good time still doesn’t result in fun. Overlong, overstuffed and soulless, for fans who grew up with Optimus and Co, The Last Knight will sting like a bee."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"It’s all an overstuffed mess, but that was true of the previous entries as well, and audiences obviously don’t seem to mind."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"By now you know exactly what to expect from a Transformers film: undeniably epic action spectacle at the cost of character, logic or genuine drama. Predictably formulaic."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"The Last Knight is not, in any conventional sense, entertaining or good, although parts of it are spectacular."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"Bay's latest Transformer title is a daunting behemoth of a film and you can feel every ounce of dead weight, as sins of the past are committed without any signs of stopping."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,"There’s fun to be had in The Last Knight, if you can find it among the chaos — and if you can remember it after the fact."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,40,The Last Knight is the loudest and most explosively dull installment yet.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"This is Bay’s world, and when faced with the end of the world, there’s only one message to be gleaned from this supposed finale of the “Transformers” franchise: The Mack trucks and the muscle cars will outlive us all."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"For better or worse (emphasis on the latter), it was unlike anything else on the multiplex landscape. In 2017, it’s becoming difficult for Bay to distinguish his brand of brain-dead spectacle from the brain-dead spectacle of many other sequels, prequels, and remakes."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"When words fail in The Last Knight, the crunching and crashing and KLANKing of the special-effects scenes take up the slack. Punishingly overwrought in every aspect, Last Knight is a KLANK! KLANK! KLUNKER."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,38,"The rhythmic assurance of truly bracing screen action, even if it's just a bunch of metal beating up a bunch of other metal, or clobbering humans, never gains traction. The cross-cutting suggests the editors took care of things via group text."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,30,"The Transformers movies are a favorite object of critical scorn, and narratively, The Last Knight remains barely coherent. But it’s more fun than ""Age of Extinction,"" though both movies are so drunk on money and effects they accidentally go weird."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,29,"All the signature Bay Movements are here, the slow-motion hero shots, the scale so vast that even planets look small and modest, the aggressively dorky jokes, but they all have a perfunctory feel, like even Bay couldn’t muster up much enthusiasm this time."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"Watching “Transfomers” is like sitting in a car that’s revving its engine while stuck in the mud. It sounds like it’s getting somewhere, even though all it ever does is spin its wheels."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"It’s easily the worst installment in this endlessly awful series, probably the worst movie of the summer."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"Bay swipes elements from other popular movies and TV shows, such as “The Da Vinci Code,” “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and “Game of Thrones.” This director’s motto? Throw everything at the wall and then blow that wall sky-high!"
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,The plot is a canvas on which to bludgeon the audience with action sequences that have been shot for maximum overstimulation.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,It’s all about as exciting as watching two drawings fight each other on a computer monitor.
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"Even if you love alien robots punching each other while tossing out insipid one-liners, it’s a painfully long two and a half hours where the biggest problem isn’t a lack of plot but way too many of them."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,25,"From the very beginning, this is an incoherent mess."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"This series’ tone-deaf humour and dull nods to selfless heroism have become toxic irritants — a sensation not helped by the film’s collection of clattering, joyless robots and dopey humans."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"It's bigger and louder and, if not longer (checking in at a mere two hours and 28 minutes), certainly stupider than ever before."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"The final explosive showdown seems to be competing with Marvel movies for spectacle. But Marvel brings wit and fun. As far as those factors go, the Transformers franchise is in very short supply."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,20,"If you’re here for the director’s trademark chaos editing (where fights go from points A to D to Q), toxic masculinity (and female objectification), comedy scenes rendered tragic (and vice versa), and general full-volume confusion, you’ll get all those things in abundance."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,16,"While the flagrant product placement is dialed back (at least on Bay’s curve) and there’s mercifully 100% less discussion of sexual consent laws this time around, the latest outing suffers from arguably the most fatal flaw a movie about giant fighting robots can: it’s brutally and relentlessly boring from start to finish."
Transformers: The Last Knight,5.2,130168683,16,"The Last Knight is like a Red Bull-charged Bay yelling “I regret nothing!” as he jumps out of a plane backwards with no chute, detonating a megaton nuclear explosive while firing Uzis at his skydiving pals above him because hell, dude, that sounds like a wicked fond farewell.

The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,100,"Aldrich was a master at presenting his distinctly cynical outlook in the context of crowd-pleasing entertainment, and The Dirty Dozen is one of his most effective and lasting efforts."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,Unarguably one of the great war movies of all time.
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,"Aldrich appears to be against everything: anti-military, anti-Establishment, anti-women, anti-religion, anti-culture, anti-life. Overriding such nihilism is the super-crudity of Aldrich's energy and his humour, sufficiently cynical to suggest that the whole thing is a game anyway, a spectacle that demands an audience."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson in the same picture. How much more bad-assedness do you need?
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,"Lee Marvin heads a very strong, nearly all-male cast in an excellent performance."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,80,"Director Robert Aldrich gets convincingly raw, tough performances in even the smallest roles."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,75,"There are some nice, amusing scenes, especially when one of the dozen (Donald Sutherland) pretends to be a general and inspects some troops. In fact, right up to the last scene the movie is amusing, well paced, intelligent."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,75,"The Dirty Dozen flows nicely, keeping things moving and drawing the audience along in its rapid current"
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,75,Robert Aldrich dissects the underlying ideas with just enough craft and thoughtfulness to make the implications of this gritty 1966 war drama unsettling in not entirely constructive ways.
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,60,"It is overlong, uneven and frequently obscure, but will succeed by virtue of its sustained action, even though what it attempts to say, if anything, remains elusive."
The Dirty Dozen,7.8,45300000,50,"Sadistic, anti-Nazi slaughter mission. Entertaining as a blowtorch."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,100,Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,87,"If the word “epic” has lost its meaning in the throes of recent summers, Man of Steel forcefully redefines it."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"Feels both modern and traditional – a halfway house between the broodier Nolan way of shaking things up and the louder, bone-crunching style that director Zack Snyder established with films such as ‘300’ and ‘Sucker Punch’. Man of Steel is punchy, engaging and fun, even if it slips into a final 45 minutes of explosions and fights during which reason starts to vanish and the science gets muddy."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"It aches for more depth and warmth and humour, but this is spectacular sci-fi — huge, operatic, melodramatic, impressive. It feels the right Superman origin story for our era, and teases what would be a welcome new superfranchise."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,80,"A bracing attempt to bring the legend back into contention that successfully separates itself from other Super-movies but misses some of their warmth and charm. But given the craft and class, this could be the start of something special"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,The most striking and curious aspect of Man of Steel is the way it minimizes and even shuts out women.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"David Goyer, who wrote the script for Man of Steel from a story he concocted with Christopher Nolan, found a new way to make us care: The title character is disturbed by everything in his adopted home."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Man of Steel is, first and foremost, a great spectacle."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Deploying an impeccable American accent, Brit Henry Cavill may be as charming as the late great Christopher Reeve."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"Goyer and Nolan have crafted in Man of Steel a taut, exploratory vision, and Snyder's later inheritance of the material indeed proves his best work since “Dawn of the Dead.”"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,75,"The action is plentiful and thumping; Marvel-size thrills await you and the generations of kids who still believe in Superman. I just mean that the movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just O.K.; but the man part is super."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"If you like your summer-movie explosions huge, Man of Steel delivers. But it seems as if it might have delivered even more than a glorious noise."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"As much spectacle and action — minute-by-minute, frame-by-frame — as any movie anyone could think of. Zack Snyder’s huge, backstory-heavy extravaganza is a rehab job that perhaps didn’t cry out to be done but proves so overwhelmingly insistent in its size and strength that it’s hard not to give in."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,70,"Snyder has cast Man of Steel with dramatic actors, not action stars, and it pays off."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,67,"Here are a few adjectives that do not apply to the new Superman movie: Beguiling. Frisky. Nuanced. Quiet. Even the title, Man of Steel, sounds too flighty for this film. Man of Lead, or Man of Plutonium, maybe."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"The story, while sometimes soaring, is other times grounded by a hyperactive and numbing vibe. But Henry Cavill has the strapping good looks of the comic icon, and humanity to match his superheroism."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"Snyder films the violence in Man of Steel the way he films most of the rest of the picture: Like a man chasing tornadoes and not even trying to keep subjects in frame. It's a choice, and not a bad one, necessarily — the Smallville farm scenes, in particular, respond well to the approach — but by the end it's a visually limiting one."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"Snyder knows how to put on a show, and Man of Steel has a massive scope that’s hard to resist... But what’s missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness, of pop joy."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,63,"What it fails to supply much of — surprisingly, it must be said — is fun. This is serious business, Snyder seems always to be saying. This is badass. And given the sheer logistical size of the spectacle on display, it's a position that's hard to argue with."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"At once frantically overblown and beautifully filigreed, Man of Steel will turn on everyone it doesn’t turn off."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"The serious-minded result has many super-cool moments. But when it gets clunky, it’s super-meh."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"It has heft, it looks amazing, and it's businesslike to a fault."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"It’s a relief just to watch the actors act once in a while, and thankfully, Snyder is astute enough to punch some breathing holes in this steel-clad colossus."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"The whole film ends up feeling weighed down: though Man of Steel bounds from one epic setpiece to another, you're left with the nagging feeling that you just can't work out what the central twosome see in each other. And for Superman and Lois Lane, that's hardly ideal."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,60,"Like Snyder’s Sucker Punch, it’s a confused but fascinating mishmash of religious, military, and sexual imagery."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,58,"While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen, the 143-minute Man of Steel is also the longest, and it only justifies that heft because it leaves room to keep the effects coming."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,58,"If this version of Superman is to have a future — as Warner Brothers seems convinced he will, having already green-lit the sequel — I hope Snyder will dial back both the casualty count and the Krypton mythmaking and instead focus on establishing a fictional Earth that’s rich enough to be worth saving."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Taking a cue from the “Batman” series, the film is dark and thudding and overlong."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"At least an hour of Man of Steel's excessive running time is devoted to the sort of crash-and-burn, slamming-into-skyscrapers CG fight scenes that we've already seen in ""The Avengers"" and ""Dark Knight,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""Spider-Man.""
Man of Steel is just the same old same old."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,What went wrong with Man of Steel? The early teasers promised Terrence Malick. The finished film is more Michael Bay.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"While its ambition and scope pull one way, its pinched and unconvincing sense of drama pull the other."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"The movie isn’t dead on arrival, like Snyder’s over-reverent ""Watchmen."" But it’s pleasure-free."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Man of Steel has too many characters and too much plot, resulting in a movie that feels overstuffed and overlong."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"If every generation gets the Superman it deserves, Man of Steel suggests we’ve earned one utterly without wit or charm."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"A mostly underwhelming film, with underdeveloped characters and supercharged fight scenes that drag on forever and offer nothing new in the way of special-effects creativity."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,The local multiplex is lousy with celluloid crime fighters. So what turf is left for good old Clark Kent? That's the nagging question that director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel tries — and ultimately fails — to answer.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,"Redundant, unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money, you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. “What are you smiling about, captain?” asks another cop. “Nothing, sir — I just think he’s hot.”"
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,50,Here's one more studio extravaganza brought down by numbing action and an addiction to generic digital effects.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"So we get no zippy, Tony Stark-flavored one-liners. No comic-relief characters. No nonsense. But that means we also get no up, up and away, either."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"Despite looking, feeling and (especially) sounding expensive – this is one of the loudest summer spectacles of recent years – Man of Steel is second-tier and third-generation Chris Nolan-flavored neo-superhero material."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"The better actors — Kevin Costner, chiefly, as the adoptive Earth father — strain to supply warmth, but mostly, the minutes stretch into great expanses of blahness, much of them filled with Transformers-grade skyscraper snapping and bloodless catastrophe."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,The humorless tone and relentlessly noisy (visually and sonically) aesthetics leave much to be desired.
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,40,"A soulless, overblown bore."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,38,"All its faux-patriotism isn't played for satire, but instead utilized to align the film with an idyllic, unquestioned vision of goodness."
Man of Steel,7.1,291045518,38,"Snyder tries to up the spectacle ante with ever more explosions, crashes, thermal blasts, topological realignments, gunfire and mano-a-mano fistfights. But the result is a punishing sense of diminishing returns and a genre that has finally reached the point of mayhem-induced exhaustion."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,100,"It’s a true story, basically a two-hander about a pair of courageous lovers lost at sea, as crushingly hard to imagine as it is to watch, but every element is so perfect that it left me shaking and devastated."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,80,"Adrift doesn’t have quite the existential gut-punch of JC Chandor’s similar All Is Lost or the recent Cannes debut  , but what it lacks in the department of pure howling cinema, it makes up for with the emotion of its central relationship."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"What keeps Adrift from feeling like just a travelogue tacked on to a tragi-sploitive star vehicle is, ironically enough, its star. Shailene Woodley has always been great when it comes to bringing the radiance – she's like a sunbeam made sentient – and even better when she can use that California Dreamin' glow semi-subversively a la ""The Spectacular Now"" or ""The Descendents."""
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Director Baltasar Kormákur's film is a simple, acutely observed love story that also happens to be a rousingly stripped-down tale of survival."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Woodley is a stronger screen presence than the low-key Claflin, but they have a lovely and natural chemistry together."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Adrift avoids the perils of most survival stories, thanks not only to its strong cast and well-structured script but to Kormákur who manages to succeed at capturing the tone of both the intimate moments and the ones where a building-sized wave looms over Tami and Richard."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"It's not just a story of an incredible feat of survival. It's also a love story, presented with the subtlety of a sledgehammer."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,"Although guilty of soft-peddling some harrowing aspects of the experience to achieve the teen-friendly PG-13 rating, Adrift nevertheless gives a flavor of the existential experience inherent in this situation by illustrating that surviving a shipwreck is as much about mental strength as physical endurance and stamina."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,75,It’s all done expertly and with an unexpectedly deft sleight-of-hand twist in the homestretch that proves once again that Kormakur is the kind of overachieving director that one pigeonholes at their own risk. He has a knack for making the familiar feel more surprising than it is.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,70,"Despite predictability, flashback hopping and cheesy lines, Adrift takes viewers on a trip through beautiful cinematography and gut-wrenching performances that are worth seeing."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,70,"Woodley gives herself over to the physical and spiritual reality of each scene. She knows how to play an ordinary woman who’s wild at heart, and she keeps you captivated, even when the film itself is watchable in a perfectly competent, touching, and standard way."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,67,"Given the sweetly dull-witted relationship at its center, Adrift threatens to bog itself down with the endless intercutting back and forth in time. But the movie has a little more up its sleeves, narratively speaking, than first appears, and Kormákur converges the two timelines effectively."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,67,"Adrift is told with an inimitable sense of place and a rare attention to detail, both of which help to ensure that we never lose sight of the terror at hand. When all else fails, which it sometimes does, Woodley is there to right the ship."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,63,It’s great seeing Woodley out of YA sci-fi and into a role that makes use of her approachable reality.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,63,"They never quite got the script right, but director Kormakur toggles well enough. And Woodley sees it through."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,63,"Adrift is paced like its title, and the story’s momentum is slowed somewhat by constant toggling between past and present."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,60,"Adrift is enough of a boilerplate piece of survival drama that you know to expect those beats more or less coming on schedule, but Woodley makes it more emotionally satisfying than it would be otherwise."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,60,"If the part of the film devoted to endurance lacks the harrowing power of, say, 2013's All Is Lost, it at least gives Woodley the opportunity to convincingly sink her teeth into a plum dramatic lead role as a young woman fighting fiercely against the forces of nature (instead of a dystopian civilization)."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,55,There’s a choppiness in the overall dramatic pull that — despite the surface appeal of the stars and Kormákur’s and cinematographer Robert Richardson’s visuals — keeps Adrift from making true waves.
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"What saves Adrift from an instant wreckage is Woodley’s performance, but still, it’s preferable to read the facts than cope with its cinematic adaptation."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Director Baltasar Kormákur makes good use of location filming on the open waters, giving this melodramatic tale a dose of realism, but this true story is never as harrowing as the subject matter would suggest. Blame it on a misjudged narrative device and Adrift’s generally adolescent approach to relationships and maritime emergencies."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Woodley and Claflin make an attractive pair, but they’re not particularly convincing playing people deeply, deeply in love. There’s something lacking in the conviction department there."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"What seems at first like an ingenious and surprising dramatic strategy feels, by the end, like an evasion on the movie’s part, a refusal to grant its subject the unflinching honesty it deserves. A true story it may be, but no one should mistake it for a truthful one."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"You can consume only so much gooey romanticism before someone gets seasick, and it’s precisely the soggy love story at the center of Adrift — a survival-at-sea adventure directed by the estimable Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur — that prevents this storm-tossed vehicle from achieving maximum upthrust."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Like ""Everest,"" Adrift is a movie throbbing with an audience’s anxiety – and yet it is not particularly dramatic."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"Like the peanut butter that serves as a primary source of sustenance in the film, Adrift can be devoured in smooth and/or crunchy modes: high-seas romance or cataclysmic adventure. There are commendable aspects to recommend each approach, yet the final result is an uneasy blend."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"The chronological back-and-forth diffuses the dread and suspense — the feeling of desperate uncertainty implied by the title — that might have made for a more intense, more memorable yarn."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,50,"As he did with his ""Everest"" cast, Kormákur draws a strong, pathos-rich performance from Woodley, filled with moments of her character confronting her own mortality and looking back on safe choices not made. It’s solid drama, but also very slow going."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,40,"Hampered by a script that fails to make the central love affair work and few new ideas while they’re stranded at sea, even the best efforts of its talented lead pair can’t keep this afloat."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,25,"Woodley has been first-rate in everything she’s been in, particularly the “Divergent” series. But there’s something about her performance here that feels like the sincere and dutiful dispersal of medicine."
Adrift,6.6,31445012,25,"There is the potential here for an engaging adventure/survival tale, wrapped in a story of a woman finding her self-confidence by drawing on untapped reserves of strength. But Kormákur fails to find any shape in the narrative of Tami’s actual or psychological journey."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"Here's a picture that you actually want to see a second time, not for the sake of further wrapping your head around its gnarly conceptual matrix, but because of the sheer visceral charge it provides. Here, at long last, is a summer movie -- like its precursors in the Terminator canon -- worth its weight in cybernetic organisms."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"This movie doesnt cop out. It doesnt go for fake, feel-good warm fuzzies, and its not for the faint of heart. Terminator 3 has guts. It has a LOT of guts. And its a rare thing for any movie  whether its a summer blockbuster or an indie arthouse flick  to have guts."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,90,"T3 delivers the goods. A hard-hitting, straight-ahead sci-fi actioner with none of the pretentions and ponderousness that have put at least a portion of the public off of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk."""
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,88,"The effects in ""T3"" are spectacular, and the action sequences -- particularly the fights between the good and bad terminators -- are exhilarating."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,83,"With him (Schwarzenegger), we return to a franchise we never knew we missed, surprisingly grateful for the star's generosity -- and evident pleasure -- in strapping on the old sunglasses and blasting adversaries to hell."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,80,"An expertly paced and efficient sci-fi thrill machine, ""T3"" effectively marries impressive action sequences with persuasive storytelling and its star's uniquely appealing style of ""No"" drama -- as in no reaction, no expression, no emotion of any kind."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,80,"Tried hard to honor the spirit of the franchise, not exploit it, and take it to a new level and a surprising destination."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,78,"Reality has overtaken the movies here, which, I suppose, makes T3 all the more cathartically appealing. At least onscreen we have Arnold Schwarzenegger in our corner."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"It puts almost everything it has into its explosive set pieces, but manages to instill the audience with just enough emotional involvement. If, Ah-nold decides to come bach again, this installment should ensure he has an audience."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Though this film doesn't have the novelty value of the first or the complex plotting of the second, it boasts the most spectacular single sequence."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Gets the most bang for its buck by letting the camera linger on the spectacle, and allowing tension, not flashiness, to be its hallmark."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"May lack the mythic pow of the 1984 original and the visionary thrill of T2, but it's a potent popcorn movie that digs in its hooks and doesn't let go until an ending that ODs on apocalyptic hoo-ha."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"This is easily the funniest of the Terminator movies (although not, it should be stressed, the lightest). It is also the shortest and most compact."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"In a summer of comic book super-operas dense with psychological torment and sprawling well over two hours, the unpretentious efficiency of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is refreshing."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"Against all odds this ""Terminator"" deserves to be welcomed back."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,75,"This third installment is the loudest, dopiest, and least inventive of the three. But what the movie...lacks in intelligence it makes up for in sheer doom."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,Pedestrian but appealing.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"At its screeching, wall-breaking best, T3 achieves heavy-metal slapstick."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"T3, while far from a classic, is an overachieving, mercenary sequel that's short on thrills, but surprisingly long on laughs and surprises."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"Overall it's reasonably thrilling anyway. If you're hoping for a brilliant revisionist take on the franchise, forget it."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"At its metallic heart, T3 is another chase movie -- one figure relentlessly tracking three others, mostly in cars, at high speed through implausibly underpopulated Los Angeles streets."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"Lacks the wonder, surprises and supercool attitude Cameron achieved.  ""T3"" is no weak sister, though. With Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the iconic title character and an often witty, fast-paced script by John Brancato, Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian, audiences worldwide will embrace the new film."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"As an action film it roars forward with agreeable, transporting energy."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,70,"That's not to say Terminator 3 is terminally awful -- just banal, merely humdrum, more conventional horror flick than science-fiction myth, and a whole lot less than what came before."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,67,"Terminator 3 moves at not-quite-breakneck speed, and the shape-shifting, metal-melting special effects aren't exactly spectacular."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,The good news is that Schwarzenegger is more entertaining than ever as the Terminator T-101 cyborg.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,Is Terminator 3 a skillful piece of work? Indeed. Will it entertain the Friday night action crowd? You bet. Does it tease and intrigue us like the earlier films did? Not really.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,"Less about the characters than about the first two movies, whose best scenes it congeals into ritual or parody."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,63,"I dont mind the movies retro-ness, but I wish Mostow didn't take pulp so seriously."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"Picking up some 10 years after the previous film left off, this stripped-down, intelligently conceived follow-up is a respectable conclusion to the Terminator trilogy."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"Where Judgment Day exhibited the profligate sprawl of a military operation, the leaner, less grandiose Rise of the Machines has the feel of a single Hummer careening through an earthquake in downtown Burbank."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"For all the hype and the inevitable box office bonanza, Terminator 3 is essentially a B movie, content to be loud, dumb and obvious."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"If none of this seems particularly fresh, you're right. ""T3"" is strikingly similar to ""T2"" and ""T,"" reflecting Hollywood's reluctance to tamper with a hit series."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,60,"The villain comes back more times than Wile E. Coyote. I found it tiresome and witless and numbingly repetitive, but action mavens won't feel cheated."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,"Has its moments, and Schwarzenegger is as buff and tough as ever. But there's a flat feeling about this effort that's unmistakable and inescapable."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,"Unfolds as a thrilling piece of entertainment, but it has a third act and ending that dont work and shouldnt ever work."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Begins promisingly and entertains for a stretch because you think it's leading to something more than one of the movie year's flattest conclusions.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Wastes no time getting very loud and very silly and never really lets up.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6.3,150371112,50,Pointless and mind-numbing.
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"This Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton. The film may be disappointing to those expecting a campy cartoon, however, although the more dramatic stylization of this version is its strongest asset."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"The movie fixes you in its gravitational pull. It's an enveloping, walk-in vision... As rich and satisfying a movie as you're likely to see all year."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,"In short, Batman is terrific - funny, smart and sensitive too, the perfect cinematic date."
Batman,7.6,251188924,100,The Batblast of the summer.
Batman,7.6,251188924,91,Jack Nicholson as The Joker helpfully provides all the colour.
Batman,7.6,251188924,88,"Nicholson embellishes fascinatingly baroque designs with his twisted features, lavish verbal pirouettes and inspired excursions into the outer limits of psychosis. It's a masterpiece of sinister comic acting."
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,Burton's direction rises to a Wagnerian hysteria (an impression backed by Danny Elfman`s roaring orchestral score) as the two mortal enemies fight it out on the brink of a zillion-foot drop. Burton achieves a genuine majesty at that moment-though he would need one or two more like it to make Batman a genuinely memorable film.
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,"If Batman did nothing else but restore pulp-art shadow to the icon sanitized in his pop-art TV reincarnation, it would be an achievement. Tim Burton's Batman, starring a subdued Michael Keaton as you-know-who and a supercharged Jack Nicholson as the Joker, handily accomplishes that mission."
Batman,7.6,251188924,80,Batman is largely content to skim the surface and bask in the light of its visual style.
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"Despite its interesting, grim tone and undeniably striking visuals from director Burton and production designer Furst, the film fails to synthesize its strengths into a compelling whole."
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"The main problem is that Burton operates best on a modest scale; saddled with a blockbuster, he doesn't know how to animate all the dead space."
Batman,7.6,251188924,75,"The movie's problem is that no one seemed to have any fun making it, and it's hard to have much fun watching it. It's a depressing experience."
Batman,7.6,251188924,70,"It's neither funny nor solemn. It has the personality not of a particular movie but of a product, of something arrived at by corporate decision."
Batman,7.6,251188924,70,"Nicholson's Joker will be the pivotal point for many. It's his energy, spurting like an artery, that keeps the picture alive; it's certainly not the special effects, the editing, which has no discernible rhythm, or the flaccid screenplay."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all—or, anyway, more than enough to transport moviegoers back to the dazzling, thrill-sated matinee idyls of old. It is surely the best two hours of pure entertainment anyone is going to find in the summer of '81."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Plays like an anthology of the best parts from all the Saturday matinee serials ever made.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"One of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Ford's performance is an underrated but remarkable achievement; he succeeds in fully embodying a comic-book style hero without ever descending into camp.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Spielberg has deftly veiled proceedings in a sense of mystical wonder that makes it all the more easy for viewers to suspend disbelief and settle back for the fun.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be. What is it? An adventure film that plays like an old-time 12-part serial that you see all at once, instead of Saturday-to-Saturday. It's a modern ""Thief of Baghdad."" It's the kind of movie that first got you excited about movies when you were a kid."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,It's the thrills that keep it moving.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,Finds the right balance between reverence and wit.
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,100,"The movie is so entertaining it hardly seems right to say it's susceptible to holes being picked in it, but it is."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,90,"Seeing “Raiders” is like being put through a Cuisinart—something has been done to us, but not to our benefit."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,8.5,248159971,90,"Travels fast and straight down a linear plot, and the ceaseless rush quickly becomes monotonous."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,80,Ratner is unable to maintain the emotional intensity that has made this series so deeply epic. But he sure knows how to put on a show.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"Love it or hate it, X-III packs more action and razzle-dazzle visuals into its 104-minute running time than ""Mission: Impossible III,"" ""Poseidon"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" combined."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"The happiest news about the third (and final?) X-Men movie is actually quite sad: headstones. Yes, The Last Stand brings the lamentable deaths of several major characters."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,It delivers pretty much what's expected.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,75,"Though the picture is not without its wow-inducing, SFX-driven moments, that potent X-factor is considerably diminished in Singer's absence."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"It's a fast and enjoyable B-movie, though, and Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine brings some good stormy drama to the proceedings."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"The result, though it delivers only in fits and starts, is still sharper and more inventive than most comicbook-adapted fare, and eventually gets the job done as far as action buffs are concerned."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"If little else, the third and supposedly final entry in the  X-Men mega-franchise suggests that some movies -- or at any rate some formulas -- are not just critic-proof, they might even be director-proof."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"If this really is the last stand, it's a stylish farewell indeed."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"Ratner seems to have found a theme that he can relate to: A terrifying trio of angry, undomesticated women who all but run away with the movie."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"Ratner's version is friskier, shallower-and more fun."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,70,"This is interesting stuff. So why does The Last Stand feel driven to dumb itself down, as if embarrassed by its own ideas?"
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,67,"I suppose it's asking too much of Ratner to impart some kind of visionary flourish to the proceedings. But without it, these comic-book movies all tend to look the same."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,67,"Whether the entry is good, great or (in this case) indifferent, it's always stimulating to return to the high-flying X-Men series."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,67,"Disappointingly, X-Men: The Last Stand slides back between the first two episodes. It's not stuporous, and it's not super."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Has a couple of emotionally resonant scenes that build on the first two story lines. But it lacks the intriguing moody quality of the previous films. The mutants are more pumped up and angry this time, rather than misunderstood and conflicted."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"While I didn't love it, I enjoyed The Last Stand because it made me imagine the mutant powers I want to develop. I'm thinking along the lines of merging Rogue's suction abilities with Storm's controlled-rain skills."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"But for all the sound, fury and spectacle, the film feels vaguely hollow and unsatisfying."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,Mostly about extending a Hollywood franchise with ever-diminishing returns.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Director Brett Ratner can't make chicken a la king out of chicken droppings, and that's what writers Simon Kinberg (""XXX: State of the Union"") and Zak Penn (""Elektra"") supply."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"With more superheroes, more action and more stuff blowing up than ever before, X-Men: The Last Stand has the climactic oomph that suggests a finale, though not the gravitas to suggest a resolution."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Comic-book enthusiasts can breathe a sigh of relief: Brett Ratner hasn't completely ruined the X-Men series a.k.a. ""The Franchise that Bryan Singer Built."""
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,63,"Singer's absence is felt but not fatal. By adding too much new blood Ratner loses some of the original DNA, but with its nifty set-pieces and a few nasty surprises, X3's still a worthy enough sequel to ensure it’s no Last Stand."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,60,"Only half a mess -- and even with all its flaws, it's an enjoyable diversion that shows both respect and affection for the formidable legacy of the ""X-Men"" comics."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,60,"Following two superior entries, Ratner's slick placeholder of a sequel lacks that crucial X-factor called inspiration."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,58,"Almost as mindless as ""Fantastic Four,"" but more annoying in that this one has philosophical pretensions."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Despite all the grand gestures of climax and resolution, there's a pronounced sense of autopilot; the only person who seems to be having a good time is Ian McKellen as the scheming Magneto."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"There's much to enjoy here – Ratner's pacing is fluid and fast and the film rushes along its busy, cluttered way with something approaching melodramatic snarkiness – but it's also terribly busy and cluttered."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Mostly, as so often with these types of empty entertainments, you are left to wonder why companies that hire so many fine actors to run around under latex and foam and have the best technological wizardry money can buy seem to spend so little attention to the screenplay."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Last stand? My ass. Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X-Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"It's a disappointing chapter in what until now has been a highly entertaining, even thought-provoking series."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Ratner makes a hash of the story and characters his predecessor brought to such complex, sympathetic life, delivering a pumped-up exercise in mayhem, carnage and blunt-force trauma."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,An uninspired hodgepodge.
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,50,"Long before the movie's climax, in which Magneto (Ian McKellen) turns smashed-up automobiles into fiery projectiles to be hurled at his enemies, those in the audience will know what it means to behold a flaming hunk of junk."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,40,"Has a few high points, but feels far too disjointed and slapdash to favorably compare to what came before."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6.7,234362462,40,"What a comedown, after the weirdly beautiful things Singer and his technicians did in the first two movies."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,100,"The Karate Kid was one of the nice surprises of 1984 -- an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,90,"John G. Avildsen is back in the Rocky ring with The Karate Kid. More precisely, it is a Rocky for kids. Morita is simply terrific, bringing the appropriate authority and wisdom to the part."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,80,"Though shamelessly manipulative, it is undeniably effective. It offers some genuine moments of warmth, humor and excitement. Of course it all leads up to a big tournament where Fair Play has a showdown with Dirty Tricks. Guess who wins. This is the kind of movie where you find yourself cheering even though you know you're being hoodwinked."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,75,"The Karate Kid might have been more endurable, maybe even endearing, if its runtime had been trimmed of a solid 30 minutes."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,75,"Ralph Macchio's transformation from high school geek to butt-kicking tough guy, thanks to a little help from Chinese sage Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita) and his homespun Oriental wisdom, is entertaining enough."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,63,"When karate is not being treated as the latest excuse for an Impossible Dream success story, and when the film is able to find more in Daniel's martial-arts career than pure Rocky-esque competitiveness, The Karate Kid exhibits warmth and friendly, predictable humor, its greatest assets."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,60,"As in the Rocky films, Avildsen's only directorial strategy is to delay the final confrontation for so long that all the audience's pent-up frustration explodes with it. It's primitive, predatory stuff."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,60,"In short, The Karate Kid presents the smallest imaginable variations on three well-tested formulas for movie success. Robert Mark Kamen's script is developed with maddening predictability, and John G. Avildsen's direction is literal and ambling. Films like this are what the PG rating is supposed to be all about."
The Moment of Truth,7.2,90815558,60,"This is actually director Avildsen's first hit since Rocky, and it has the same mixture of calculation and apparent naïveté. It borrows its formula from both East and West with good humour, and is completely free of intelligence, discrimination and originality. No wonder it's a hit."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,100,"Not only is it a thrill-a-minute ride, but it has one of the best film villains in recent memory, a hero everyone can relate to, dialogue that crackles with wit, and a lot of very impressive pyrotechnics."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,100,"Only the hardest of hearts could fail to enjoy the great 80s action classic, rereleased for its 30th anniversary: with uproarious explosions, deafening shootouts and smart-alec tag lines following the bad guys getting shot."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,100,"A firepowered, blood-drenched action picture that doesn't let up."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,88,"As high tech, rock hard and souped up as an action film can be."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,80,"A logistical wonder, a marvel of engineering, and relentlessly, mercilessly thrilling."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,75,"A triumph of slick direction and lowbrow thrills, marred but not spoiled by a sour aftertaste."
Die Hard,8.2,83008852,75,"On a technical level, there's a lot to be said for Die Hard. It's when we get to some of the unnecessary adornments of the script that the movie shoots itself in the foot."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,80,Downey has a winning take on Holmes: He's always on.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,"Hey, remember “fun”? If you’re sick of the apocalypse and tortured anti-heroes, then you need to see Sherlock Holmes. It’s a blast from start to finish."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,"The less I thought about Sherlock Holmes, the more I liked ""Sherlock Holmes."" Yet another classic hero has been fed into the f/x mill, emerging as a modern superman."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,"It pleases me to report, then, that Downey brings his brain, his wit, and his gift for intelligent underplaying, even as he understands he has been hired to play Sherlock Holmes, action hero."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,75,This is very much a Sherlock Holmes movie for the blockbuster era.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"Ritchie has never worked on a scale anything approaching this before and, while some of the directorial affectations are distracting, he keeps the action humming."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"Challenged by Downey’s energy, Jude Law, who often seems aimless in his movies, comes fully up to speed. He’s virile and quick-witted, and his Watson, if not Holmes’s equal in brainpower, comes close to him in daring. Their repartee evokes the banter of lovers in a screwball comedy; they flirt outrageously but chastely."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"There's a mystery at the heart of Sherlock Holmes, and it's not the one the great master of detection has been called on to solve. It's how a film that has so many good things going for it has turned out to be solid but not spectacular."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"The movie as a whole is clever, and conspicuously overwrought. But Mr. Downey's performance is elegantly wrought; he's as quick-witted as his legendary character, and blithely funny in the lovers' spats—all right, the mystery-lovers' spats—that Holmes keeps having with Jude Law's witty Dr. Watson."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"There are worse things than loutish, laddish cool, and as a series of poses and stunts, Sherlock Holmes is intermittently diverting."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,70,"Entertaining in a glossy, mindless way."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,67,"Sherlock Holmes is an odd amalgam, a top-heavy light entertainment that keeps throwing things at you and doesn't seem too concerned with whether they stick."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,67,"Here's hoping that younger members of the audience will seek out Conan Doyle's original stories to further explore Holmes' official amanuensis, Dr. John Watson, whose brilliant case studies regarding his friend, roommate, and fellow rationalist are the stuff dreams are made of."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,"The reason Sherlock Holmes fails at least as often as it succeeds is because more effort and attention was lavished upon the concept than upon the script. Given a worthy story, Downey's Holmes might have been memorable. Here, he's an interesting character in search of a worthwhile story."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,"The result is only half as hip as hoped. Yes, this Holmes is leaner and meaner, and Watson (Jude Law) is nearly his equal. But there’s still something fussy about the result, as if bobbies had broken up the party at 11:59."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,Sherlock Holmes has been reimagined with fighting skills as potent as his intellectual acumen.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,63,"Ritchie and company spend too much time being cute and not enough time being clever, resulting in a one-dimensional comic-book version of Doyle's detectives."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,60,"A fun, action-packed reintroduction to Conan Doyle's classic characters. Part Two should provide more in the way of scope."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,60,"In short, Ritchie's come up with precisely what you'd expect of him — a pumped-up, anachronistically modern Sherlock Holmes designed for the ADD crowd. Expect a sequel. Or six."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,60,"By now we’ve seen so many good, bad, and indifferent Sherlocks that it’s almost a relief to get something different, however wrongheaded. And there’s no such thing as too much Downey."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Ritchie is all about the whooshing and headbanging, leaving no space between Holmes' words to savor their meaning. Downey is irresistible. The movie, not so much."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"As over-emphatic as one might expect from the ham-fisted Guy Ritchie, this resurrection of the world's most famous detective is a dank, noisy affair."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Not even Sherlock Holmes could make much sense out of the overplotted, murky mess that is ""Sherlock Holmes,"" although Arthur Conan Doyle's legendarily brainy detective would probably never buy a ticket to a movie as elephant-footed as this one."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"With a clamorous soundtrack and a whirl of elaborate chases and busily choreographed fight scenes, this is Sherlock Holmes with Attention Deficit Disorder."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Despite some arresting visual flourishes and Downey’s inherent likeability, it’s nearly incoherent both as cinema and as story.  No, this isn’t your grandfather’s or your father’s Sherlock Holmes, but if theirs featured Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett in the lead, it was better by miles."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Guy Ritchie is the worst screenwriter in the world, but, to be fair, he is not the worst director. He is only the worst director of the people who actually get to make movies."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,50,"Guy Ritchie's Holmes reboot feels both too complicated and too elementary, dear Watson."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,42,This is certainly the grubbiest Holmes in movie history.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,40,Sherlock Holmes goes wrong in many ways except for one -- at the boxoffice.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,40,"This is the ultimate sin of the film, generically helmed by lad-auteur Guy Ritchie: Logic seems to be thrown out the window in order to make room for clashes on a partially completed Tower Bridge. It’s way too elementary."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,38,It's a serious drag to see how Ritchie has turned Holmes and Dr. Watson into a couple of garden-variety thugs.
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,38,"Sherlock Holmes dumbs down a century-old synonym for intelligence with S&M gags, witless sarcasm, murky bombast and twirling action-hero moves that belong in a ninja flick."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,38,"This ""Holmes"" is just about as silly as it awesome. At times, Ritchie and company try so hard to make sure this isn't your father's ""Sherlock Holmes"" that it comes across as, well, cartoonish."
Sherlock Holmes,7.6,209028679,30,"The very idea of handing him over to professional lad Guy Ritchie (who directed Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), to be played as a punch-throwing quipster by Robert Downey Jr., is so profoundly stupid one can only step back in dismay."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,91,"MIB3 is one giant leap for mankind because Josh Brolin shows up to play the younger Agent K. And he just nails the feat, triumphantly creating a riff on/homage to the Tommy Lee Jones-ness of K that goes much deeper (and funnier) than a simple imitation of drawl and speech patterns."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,80,"It manages, in the end, to be touching as well as hectic and whimsical, and to send a few interesting thematic bubbles into the air, having to do with lost fathers, obscure regrets and racial reconciliation."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,80,"Finding smart ways to bring novelty to the franchise without forsaking what made the original so much fun (and in fact doubling down on some of those qualities), Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black 3 easily erases the second installment's vague but unpleasant memory and -- though we might hope producers will quit while they're ahead -- paves the way for future installments."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,80,"You do sense, though, that the people behind MIB3 (mainly veteran producer Walter F. Parkes and script doctor David Koepp) were smart enough to let the audience grow up a bit, enough to get the Andy Warhol jokes and one brilliantly weird creation, a delicate alien who can see every outcome at once."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,The aliens are as gloppy and gross as ever. I especially liked the joke about Andy Warhol being an alien – except didn't we know that already?
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"While this third go-round may not seem necessary amid summer's blockbusters, it's an entertaining jaunt back in time with the likably mismatched duo."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"If you're looking for cinema verite, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun, fizzy sequel in a franchise left for dead 10 years ago, have at it."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"So did the world need another ""Men in Black""?  No, not at all.  But if there had to be one, then it's certainly a relief that it should be one as agreeable as this."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"Delight, a modest yet palpable measure of the stuff, is restored."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,The film is largely redeemed by an unexpected emotional resonance befitting a Steven Spielberg production.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,75,"Although I liked the first ""MiB"" movie, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this belated sequel. But I had fun. It has an ingenious plot, bizarre monsters, audacious cliff-hanging, and you know what? A closing scene that adds a new and sort of touching dimension to the characters of J and K."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,70,"Sonnenfeld's best movies function like elaborate Rube Goldberg contraptions, with visual gags popping out on a precise calibration of gears and springs, and Cohen's script, however derivative, is a stable apparatus."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,70,Good trippy fun.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,70,It's clear the filmmakers aren't simply expecting to coast on audience goodwill...Men in Black 3 is at its best when it simply owns its own absurdity.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"It's a brisk but restful breeze blowing through our heads, requiring no thought whatsoever – in fact, thoughts are an impediment to enjoying it – and touching us just a bit in unexpected ways."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"The effects are cheese-whizzy fun, but it's the unexpected spark between Smith and Brolin that makes MiB3 primo summer fun. Way cool."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"It still has cool creatures and 1960s set design, and the 3-D is the best of the season, but if you try to remember the story or jokes, you'll find that you've been hit by a neuralyzer beam."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,"Brolin's performance is funny, masterful, confident, and more than a little unsettling. If one human being can sample another, that's what's going on here. The rest of Men in Black 3 is about as good as one could hope for from an unnecessary sequel that's a decade late to the party."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,63,This only mildly bloated and convoluted action comedy has enough inspired moments to wipe out memories of the abysmal 2002 first sequel as surely as one of the black-suited heroes' neutralizer.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"Most wonderful of all is Josh Brolin as the young Agent K. It's so easy to believe that Brolin could turn into Jones, given a couple of decades."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"The comedy sci-fi franchise returns after a ten-year hiatus, with the same formula of respectably funny wisecracks and obsessively detailed space monsters."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"It's by no means a triumph, but one of the enjoyable things about Men in Black has always been the malleable nature of its reality."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"A solidly entertaining summer movie is always welcome, even if it can't quite claim to be out of this world."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,"The good news is that it's better than the second ""Men in Black."" The bad news is: not all that much. There are a couple of clever ideas, a few funny moments, a wealth of computer-generated special effects. But it's hollow at its core, and the asides have lost some of their spark."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,60,Men in Black 3 is exactly what you'd expect: amiable mediocrity and nicely laid-back performances with pricy special effects plugging in the gaps where jokes should be.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,58,"If this movie truly cost $375 million to produce and market (as the L.A. Times reported), the biggest chunk isn't on the screen."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,"What we're left with is a thoroughly mediocre, shrug-generating disappointment -- and one that certainly doesn't feel like it should have cost more than a third of a billion dollars to make and market."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,"The finished product is in a different league than the whompingly terrible Men in Black II - it hits its marks. But it's not inventive enough to overcome the overarching inertia, the palpable absence of passion."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,"The younger man's personality is all the more startling for the skill and generosity with which Mr. Brolin creates a persuasively vital K while foreshadowing the grump to come. The script explains the change in elaborate detail, but the performance defies explanation; it's mysteriously marvelous."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,50,More like an attempt to reenergize a franchise than rebottle the lightning that electrified the original.
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,40,"Despite such ubiquitous timidity, one can pluck out a few pleasing distractions here."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,40,"In a summer hardly starved of comic-book properties, this redundant extension of a series that ran out of gas a decade ago doesn't need a neuralyzer to be forgettable."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,40,"Despite some good moments, Agents J, O and K are missing an E."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,38,"This third outing climaxes with a dark and melodramatic twist that, while adding a layer of nuance and back story that the previous two films never had, also feels wildly out of sync with its audience's expectations."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,38,"Those who don't understand what it means for an actor to ""sleepwalk"" through a performance need only watch Men in Black III; there's no shortage of examples."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,30,"So creaky and out of touch it inspires pity. Its opening sequences are a near marvel of confusion, mayhem and embarrassments for its actors. If it was a person, you'd worry it had dementia."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,30,"Less extraordinary and considerably more banal, given the sci-fi/comedy subject matter, is Men in Black 3's story, which jumps the ectomorphic shark in high style but with a deficit of actual belly laughs."
Men in Black 3,6.8,179020854,25,"Men in Black 3 is so dull and empty, it's the first movie that has ever made me think ""Thank God this is in 3D."""
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,80,"Not quite magnificent but certainly Fuqua’s best since ""Training Day"" and a rare remake that actually delivers. Yee-haw!"
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,80,If Fuqua and his screenwriters (including True Detective’s Nic Pizzolatto) slightly botch the underlying theme of redemption—Ethan Hawke’s haunted ex-Confederate sharpshooter could have been more developed—it still makes good on its ideas of community pride.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,Fuqua’s remake is a worthy successor to the ’60s “Seven.”
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"In our post-Tarantino world, Fuqua shows remarkable restraint. The long, efficiently filmed battle doesn’t douse us in blood; for once, PG-13 is the proper rating for a violent film."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"This entertaining and handsome-looking version of The Magnificent Seven is very much tailored to his star, right down to Washington’s real-life history as a preacher’s son."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"The new Seven isn't aiming for cinema immortality. It's two hours of hardcore, shoot-em-up pow and it's entertaining as hell."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"The Magnificent Seven had me smiling throughout, tapping into Saturday matinee memories without seeming entirely old-fashioned."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"Fuqua isn’t interested in pushing the genre forward so much as respecting and updating the model accordingly. The director focuses on establishing his gang of gunslingers sturdily enough that the action becomes easy to engage with, and even get excited about."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"This Seven’s just silly, solid entertainment: multiplex fun by numbers."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"Over all, this is a rousing, albeit sometimes cheesy, action-packed Western bolstered by Denzel Washington’s baddest-of-the-baddasses lead performance, mostly fine supporting work, and yep, some of the most impressively choreographed extended shootout sequences in recent memory."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,Fuqua's film is ultimately a reminder of why the genre was once so wildly popular in the first place.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,75,"Truly, The Magnificent Seven is a story of simple pleasures, and it gets the little things right."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,70,"If body count is what you go to Westerns for, by all means drift into this one's corral. It's hardly magnificent, and apart from its casting it's not doing anything particularly original with its premise. But it's diverting in about the way you'd expect of a remake twice removed — call it a perfectly competent seven."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,70,"Magnificent Seven has one and only true goal: It’s a new Hollywood crack at good, old-timey entertainment."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,70,"It’s a fun movie, a nicely made Western in which bad guys get to be good guys sometimes. Maybe that should be enough, but you can’t help wanting more."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,67,"The marketing may try to dress it up like a prestige picture, but Magnificent Seven is a summer season thrill ride."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,63,"Pure blockbuster gloss – perfectly fine for a Saturday afternoon matinee, but instantly forgettable once you’ve emerged from the dark of a multiplex."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,63,"It ain’t Shakespeare, or even Kurosawa. But it’s an acceptable remake of a western that itself was an acceptable remake of one of the greatest movies ever made. Enjoyable, even, until the last act proves how dull an overextended gun battle can get."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,63,"As passably entertaining as the film is, it never surrenders to the abandon of its action, and as such never feels like it shifts out of first gear."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"You get enough of a sense of this place and these men — and that widow! — that it's a disappointment when, in the end, we just have to watch it all blow to hell."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"Struggling with tone and urgency during its recruiting phase, the film clomps along to a pedestrian drum-roll, summoning a stark, brooding edge without quite enough lift-off."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"The film is mindless entertainment by way of scoundrels, dynamite and honor – not quite magnificent, but “The Watchable Seven” just doesn’t have the same ring to it."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"The new movie is as moth-eaten as the serapes strewn through the 1960 film, but there’s no denying the appeal of the image of Mr. Washington riding a horse, shooting a Colt and leading a posse of vigilantes to save a mostly white Western town."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,60,"There’s a fine line between a slowburn and dull, and this Magnificent Seven frequently finds itself on the wrong side."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Traces of real history are hard to spot in Fuqua’s Western, but there isn’t much evidence of a real Western, either. You sense that an entire genre, far from being revitalized, is being plundered for handy tips."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The picture is action-packed but mindlessly so, and it’s neither light enough to work as a coltish entertainment nor smart enough to cut beyond anything but the most rote notions of masculinity."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Despite a great cast and several terrific action sequences, Fuqua's film is largely forgettable."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,The Magnificent Seven is like a long-fused stick of dynamite: It takes forever to get interesting but does at least unleash an explosive finale.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"If there’s a compelling reason to remake The Magnificent Seven, it can’t be found in the 2016 version, a loud, cluttered, and generally disappointing production."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"This movie's all over the place, trying too hard to be all Westerns to all sensibilities."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The Magnificent Seven is fine as far as it goes, but — especially when the familiar strains of the 1960 theme song begin wafting over the final scenes — one can’t help feeling that it should have gone much further."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,Go in with low expectations and you might be pleasantly surprised.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Only when there’s an opportunity to blow things up does Fuqua seem fully engaged.
Another Western bites the dust."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"A sense of lethargy hangs uneasily over the lumbering new version of The Magnificent Seven. Despite its sturdy plot, seasoned director and capable cast toplined by Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, it arrives in a comatose state, a film unlikely to arouse passions one way or another."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"More importantly, copying an earlier era’s empty slickness still produces only empty slickness."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,Neglects to provide the characters with enough background history to explain what makes them such original figures in the Old West.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"This “Seven” is more diverse, less patronizing than the famous Western it remakes. But it lacks the moral certitude and righteousness of its predecessor, a pre-Vietnam “America saves Paradise from a Dictator” allegory."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,The group...make a fine crew. But the rest of the movie doesn’t find enough interesting wrinkles on the old formula to merit a reboot.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The sheer talent of the cast here sometimes provides enough depth to get audience members to the climactic shoot-out, and there are a few definite MVPs in terms of ensemble, but it’s hard to envision this film having anywhere near the cinematic legacy of those that inspired it."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Fuqua is trying for John Ford meets Sergio Leone: a funky classical sweep, with room for delirious shootouts. The trouble is that he mimics the trademarks of those directors without their élan, and the plot that was once catchy is now rote."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"Except for the fact that virtually every shot, chop or stab the good guys make hits its mark to make the bad guys quickly drop like toy soldiers, the climactic showdown delivers what it needs to action-wise, leading to a satisfactory wrap-up."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,50,"The performances are dedicated, but the camaraderie feels perfunctory, outside of a few ruminative exchanges between Hawke and Washington."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"The Magnificent Seven has the trappings of a classic Western and it hits its marks. All of Fuqua’s movies hit their marks — even sadistic formula junk like ""The Equalizer."" But there’s no grandeur in its images or generosity in its soul. I don’t think Fuqua ever loved Westerns. And by the time this movie ended, I’d forgotten why I do."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"Instead of ever getting truly ""Magnificent,"" these multicultural gunslingers remain largely a meh seven."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"As a result, while the film is certainly intense at times, it's not some sort of Sam Pekinpah blood-fest."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"Slick but forgettable, Fuqua’s suicide squad is a macho posse movie that could use a jab of fun. It’s The Magnificent Seven, but the “magnificent” is silent."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,Richard Wenk and Nic Pizzolatto's screenplay completely lacks the interpersonal vibrancy that a film like this needs and this is glaring given that it maintains the slow-build tension of the original.
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,40,"Because the roles are underwritten and the players struggle to establish a rapport, The Magnificent Seven never lets the audience feel like its along for the ride with a dynamic group of death-or-glory hombres."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,30,"Ethan Hawke is appealing as a polysyllabic coward of some complexity, but Mr. Washington has been stripped of his usual verve and grace. Sometimes you can catch him going slack, like a man looking for the exit."
The Magnificent Seven,6.9,93432655,25,"It would be too easy to say The Magnificent Seven isn’t magnificent. It’s definitely not, but the film has an even more egregious quality: it’s uninspired. There’s no risk, no real attempts to subvert expectations, and no desire to truly give the audience something, if not entirely new, then at least surprising."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,91,"No, it doesn't exactly re-create the magic that made the original such an instant classic, but it's faster and more involving than ""Reloaded"" and it rounds off the premise and themes of the trilogy in a surprisingly satisfying way."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,80,"The trilogy ascends and soars with the two combatants and ends not with a whimper but with a blast of light. Thus the fabulous original film has found an honorable way to sign off. For those who didn't bother to join the early crowds, The Matrix Revolutions is a definite might see."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,75,"To the degree that I was able to put aside my questions, forget logic, disregard continuity problems and immerse myself in the moment, The Matrix Revolutions is a terrific action achievement. Andy and Larry Wachowski have concluded their trilogy with all barrels blazing."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,75,"Revolutions, the final installment in the trilogy, parcels things more neatly. You get 45 minutes of the Wachowskis' patented theosophical bong water, followed by an hour of the most muscular, hard-core special-effects rama-lama yet to hit the screen. Only then does Jesus show up."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,70,"Though theyre full of undeniably spectacular moments, great production values and unusual ambition, a simple thing has gotten lost in these sequels: theyre not much fun."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,70,"No less than the rankest demagogue, The Matrix Revolutions insists on the primacy of faith over knowledge. Once it locks and loads, however, the triumphant visuals short-circuit anything resembling abstract thought."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,67,"Its an impressive closing to the cycle, and, frankly, one that arrives not a moment too soon."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,63,"Represents a disappointing way for the science fiction trilogy to bow out. Overlong and underwhelming, The Matrix Revolutions reinforces the thinking that its a rare movie series in which the final chapter is the strongest."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,63,"On the plus side, there are these super-scary mechanical octopus-type things with a billion eyes and metal tentacles that fly in great awful swarms and look like the non-organic versions of the flying-brain-and-spinal-cord monsters that made the otherwise laughable '60s sci-fi flick ""Fiend Without aFace"" so cool."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,Everything about the sequel feels bloated.
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"Ending with neither a bang nor a whimper, the finale falls somewhere in between. It's an improvement over its concurrently shot, babbling predecessor, but it ultimately fails to capture any of that jaw-dropping sense of exhilaration that made the original such a must-see event."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"It neither works as a stand-alone film nor captures the thrilling sense of somber, pulpy mystery that made ""The Matrix"" so compelling. Nevertheless, It brings the saga to a satisfying close, and relies less on the clumps of pop-mystical cyber gobbledy-gook that gummed up the gears of ""Reloaded"" and more on the powerful emotional bonds that bind Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Niobe, Link and Zee."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"The result is visually slick, almost shockingly simpleminded, kinda redundant and only adequately satisfying. Alas, for their dramatic wrap-up the Wachowskis' storytelling now feels less intriguing than merely dutiful."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"Shot at the same time as ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" this last installment is the shortest of the bunch at 129 minutes, but I still succumbed to special-effects hypnosis in the last hour."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"The Year Of The Matrix will be remembered as an indulgence for fans, while the original movie will be affectionately held as a separate entity by a bigger crowd, much as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy hasn't really been tainted by divisions over Episodes I and II."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,60,"Among its better tricks, Matrix Revolutions finally gets the love-story subplot of Neo and Trinity in the right proportion."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,58,"You can virtually see the mystique peeling away while beholding the turgid melodrama, patchy plotting, windy dialogue and, yes, spectacular combat effects of this grand finale."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"At the risk of understatement, The Matrix Revolutions sucks."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Mostly feels as hackneyed as the first film felt fresh. It's a loud, puffed-up exercise in computer-generated heroics and battles that follows a pattern."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Unless you're seriously into the post-""Matrix"" culture, which includes books, games, animation and interactive Web sites, or you believe the Wachowskis have a philosophy worth wading through, the two-part sequel adds nothing indispensable to the first story."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,How did something that started out so cool get so dorky?
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Sets out to answer all sorts of cosmic questions, though the one most frequently asked is more mundane: Is it better than ""Reloaded""? The answer is a matter of degree."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"The Matrix Revolutions blends feather-brained, starry-eyed camp and rock-'em-sock-'em spectacle -- so it's at least more entertaining than the second Matrix film, which hung in the air like a noxious cloud."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"It's a testament to the personalities of the actors, as well as the foundation laid by the original film, that we retain an emotional connection to the main players in Revolutions."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"There are, to be sure, some impressive special effects here, and whoever Warner Bros. hires to make the new Superman movie should take notes."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Now The Matrix Revolutions is here, and a verdict is justified. The death penalty seems a little strong, but can we lock this franchise up and forget where we put the key?"
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Isn't a terrible movie, but it is a tremendous disappointment."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Written and directed by the clever Wachowski brothers, this is a sequel that only a die-hard fan could love. But those fans will love it very, very much."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"Nearly wall-to-wall climax -- an unwieldy, two-plus-hours third act of a movie, guided by the principle (incubated by ""Reloaded"" and fully grown here) that too much is never too much."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,50,"There is very little that is tantalizing or suspenseful. The feeling of revelation is gone, and many of the teasing implications of ""Reloaded"" have been abandoned."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"Revolutions isn't as stupefying as ""Reloaded""--and, of course, our expectations have been drastically lowered. But it's an abysmal anticlimax all the same."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"This final installment jettisons most of the Zen mumbo-jumbo from the first two movies in favor of lots of very loud explosions. Since I didnt take the mumbo-jumbo seriously to begin with, my letdown was minor, but aficionados may feel like theyve been played for suckers."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"Once the dust clears, it's hard to think of a film saga that's wound down with such a profound anticlimax. It's a whimper in bang's clothing."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,40,"This (hopefully) final chapter's interminable first hour...showcases some of the clunkiest dialogue and wooden acting since the most recent ""Star Wars"" movies."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,38,This come-down of a series capper is so arch and pompous amid its clanks and collisions that you can only snicker at the verbal wind that obscures the din of marauding machinery.
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,38,"Without a philosophical payoff, without characters whose relationships resonate in our hearts, without explanations for situations that beg for explanations, what are we left with? To quote another great writer of battle scenes: ""a tale full of sound and fury, told by an idiot, signifying -- nothing."""
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,38,"The film is a soggy mess, essentially a loud, wild 100-minute battle movie bookended by an incomprehensible beginning and a laughable ending."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,30,"The Wachowski brothers have rendered their chronicles into banality, as if trying to imitate the qualitative tailspin of the ""Star Wars"" series."
The Matrix Revolutions,6.7,139313948,30,Dismal final installment.
Road House,6.6,30050028,80,"An immensely enjoyable slice of romanticised fisticuffs, this is a Western in every respect except the stetsons and six guns."
Road House,6.6,30050028,80,"Swayze gives up 'Dirty Dancing' for dirty fighting in this violent, spectacular and immensely enjoyable study of Zen and the art of Barroom Bouncing...Mindless entertainment of the highest order."
Road House,6.6,30050028,63,"Road House exists right on the edge between the ""good-bad movie"" and the merely bad. I hesitate to recommend it, because so much depends on the ironic vision of the viewer. This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either."
Road House,6.6,30050028,50,Road House is startling because of the intensity of its violence and because of Swayze`s mindless posturing. A young star has sold himself to become a pinup boy.
Road House,6.6,30050028,50,The film gets campier by the minute.
Road House,6.6,30050028,40,"Director Rowdy Herrington lives up to his name: once he's seen to it that all the conventions of the western are in place, he presents an all-out brawl on the average of about every 12 minutes or so, and the battles quickly grow tiresome. Swayze is up to a part that requires him merely to show his muscles and dexterity, but Gazzara is trapped in his hopelessly evil caricature, leaving Sam Elliott (in a too-limited role) to provide the film's only real charm."
Road House,6.6,30050028,40,"With Road House, United Artists hotwires Patrick Swayze a star vehicle shackled by a couple of flat tires in the script department. Ill-conceived and unevenly executed, pic essentially is a Western - a loner comes in to clean up a bar, of all things, and ends up washing and drying the whole town - but its vigilante justice, lawlessness and wanton violence feel ludicrous in a modern setting."
Road House,6.6,30050028,38,"An ugly commingling of old Westerns, Zen chic and kung fu movies...Full of gratuitous mayhem, head-bashing, gay-bashing and woman-bashing, Road House has a malicious, almost putrid tone."
Road House,6.6,30050028,38,"In Road House, Patrick Swayze has the most laughable role since Tom Cruise juggled a few liquor bottles and danced to ''The Hippy Hippy Shakes'' in Cocktail...Next to Dalton, Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing seems like Hamlet. Mr. Swayze does some dirty fighting here, but mostly the role requires a blank expression. At this point, Road House makes his career look like a bad joke."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"Sicario works on every level. It’s also fairly prescient, coming at a time when America rages on about the ethics of border control and the mounting war on drugs."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"Pulled from the news but punched up to fever pitch, Sicario represents the perfect mix of cerebral and visceral thrills. Star, director and screenwriter all bring their A-game."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"Sicario is a tentacled drug cartel thriller grabbing viewers by the throat and squeezing for two hours. This movie continually defies the conventions of its genre, from its hero's gender to the vagueness of its morality."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"A beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"It’s an unusual mix of big-picture issues, grindhouse pulp and pure, rough entertainment, bolstered by one of the better ensemble casts of the year. This movie is not, um, fussing around."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"It’s an uncommonly bold gambit, expressly designed to frustrate people who want to see a strong woman deliver a righteous ass kicking. The progressivism here is instead rooted in futility and despair, which provides much more of a valuable shock to the system."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"With a taut and timely screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a brilliant action thriller with the smarts of a message movie."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"The opening of Sicario unfolds at such an anxiety-inducing pitch that it seems impossible for Villeneuve to sustain it, let alone build on it, but somehow he manages to do just that. He’s a master of the kind of creeping tension that coils around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,100,"The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades, but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,91,"The violence is shocking, effective and soaked into the dry brown landscape."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,90,"By turns thrilling, disorienting and draining, Sicario exists in a border zone seemingly of its own devising between the art film and the action movie."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,90,"What keeps Sicario from cynicism is the nature and depth of Villeneuve’s gaze, not childishly wide-eyed but capable still of feeling pain. He’s a terrific director. You know that if his heroine, Alice, gets out of Cartel-land alive, she might spend a few months in an asylum, but she’ll be back, hell-bent on seizing the foreground."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,90,"Sicario is an ambush, a low-slung  film about a dirty drugs war with Mexico which challenges and engages in equal measure. It moves with grim tenacity, confounding expectations until its very final sequence."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Far from being just another crime story, Sicario is cinema at its most ambitious."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Sicario is a conventionally unconventional drug wars thriller, a well-cast, breathlessly executed peek into the heart of a Trumpian nightmare of Mexican cartels which kill at will on either side of an embattled border."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"So much of Sicario, Denis Villeneuve’s disturbing drama set in the world of law enforcement and Mexican drug cartels (the title is the Mexican term for a hit man), takes place on Emily Blunt’s face."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Those who go to a Villeneuve production, Sicario included, must be prepared for intense suspense, moral ambiguity, and an ending that doesn't conform to Hollywood norms."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"The sound never loses its urgency, its sense of immediate danger, straight through to the closing shot of the film."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) once again proves he can craft a gripping tale that never collapses under its own moral weight. Sicario is not an easy film to watch, but it is a riveting and essential one."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"Sicario, which combines dizzying action scenes with a taut script, ravishing photography and an otherwordly musical score, is a knockout."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,88,"In Spanish, ""sicario"" means ""hitman."" In film terms, Sicario is sensational, the most gripping and tension-packed spin through America's covert War on Drugs since Steven Soderbergh's Traffic 15 years ago."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,85,"Sicario calls to mind the films of the 1970s — not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important, but the seamy, sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,83,"Sicario starts and ends with Blunt’s impassioned performance (and she's spectacular in her final scene), but it’s Del Toro who is the real standout."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Even at its most comprehensible, there’s a lot Sicario deliberately leaves unsaid, and it builds to a crescendo of mayhem and moral rot worthy of a great film noir."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"The acting, craft, and tone of Sicario are so precise that the absurdity of this cartel yarn is both its greatest weakness, and maybe its entire point."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"There are no winners here. Maybe that’s cynical, or maybe it’s true. But it’s a bleak and sometimes powerful message that Villeneuve delivers with blunt force."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Rather than a birds’-eye procedural about a complex international mission, it’s a close-up of that mission from the point of view of the participant who understands it the least."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"This dramatic thriller finds a spot somewhere between your brain and your stomach, and drills in."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Sicario is a queasy-making thrill ride through Dick Cheney’s Theme Park on the Dark Side, with an enjoyable cast headed by Blunt, Josh Brolin as a bro-tastic but oddly sinister secret agent in flip-flops and Benicio Del Toro as a person of uncertain provenance (is he Mexican? Is he Colombian? Is he CIA?) who is approximately the scariest guy ever."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"If Sicario does not collapse under its own grimness, that is because of the pulse: the care with which Villeneuve keeps the story beating, like a drum, as he steadies himself for the next set piece."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Each set piece is orchestrated with aplomb - a raid on a tunnel under the border being a particular stand out - but Sicario is kept grounded in reality. Villeneuve keeps his focus tight on his small group of characters and though the plot is complex, it fits the Byzantine intricacies of the problem and the obscure motivations of the operators."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,80,"Blunt’s performance has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability, which functions very well against the alpha male characters higher up the chain of command."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,78,Sicario is at its best when its borderlines are fluid and indistinct.
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"It delivers a constant, exhilarating stream of elaborate and exquisitely photographed thrills that ends up largely compensating for the would-be profundity."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"I'm not sure if leavening is the right word, but Brolin, as an enigmatic U.S. agent with a world-weary cynicism and a black-ops vibe, provides at least a dose of (very) dark humor to the proceedings."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"If at any point in Sicario, you feel lost, don’t worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and, in any case, all becomes clear, eventually."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"Every scene of calm, potentially, is trip-wired for an explosion. But for all its chilling tension and horrific imagery, Sicario is also a beautiful movie."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"Sicario doesn't fall apart in its second half, exactly, but it does settle for less than it should."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"At times, Sicario is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with no rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro and typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially in its middle act, Sicario can be frustratingly self-indulgent."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,Denis Villeneuve's film views life in the age of the modern-day drug war as an ever-crescendoing existential nightmare.
Sicario,7.6,46889293,75,"Amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, yet just a bit underwhelming to really think about, Sicario Denis Villeneuve's Mexican drug cartel drama is superlatively strong in every conceivable way except story."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,67,"Though Villeneuve magnifies the pervasive dread surrounding the modern drug war, he's better at conveying the thrill of creeping through that battlefield than the complex set of interests sustaining it."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,63,"Making a film with fine performances, adept direction, first-rate photography and a doltish screenplay is like starting a rock band with no drummer. The result may yield satisfying, even memorable moments. But every time you try to build momentum, the project falls apart."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,63,"The dark nihilism of Sicario masks a reliance on easier solutions, ones we’ve been fed by decades of genre films and that feed our need for justice dispensed with violent, vengeful directness. The movie promises to clear the fetid air around the drug wars. In the end it’s just another drug."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"Sicario occasionally seems a little too impressed by its own nihilism. Still, this is an involving, grown-up film from a director whose muscular technique continues to impress: one might call it pulp in the same manner one would a plate of minced meat."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"Mr. Villeneuve, aided by Taylor Sheridan’s lean script, Roger Deakins’s parched cinematography and Johann Johannsson’s slow-moving heart attack of a score, respects the imperatives of genre while trying to avoid the usual clichés. It’s not easy, and he doesn’t entirely succeed."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"Villeneuve's proven he's got a strong punch. The trouble is, he barely aims."
Sicario,7.6,46889293,60,"There’s not much fault to find with Sicario on the level of craft or performances, just its rather sputtering momentum, and the lack of a higher purpose."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Though Aliens is unable to eschew some obvious sci-fi conventions and those of other genres as well, it brings a fresh and lively spirit to this tired cinematic clime. Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Aliens is one of the most intensely shocking films to open in ages: Even if you think you've got the stamina for cinematic suspense, you may find yourself out in the lobby, midway, catching your breath. This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"A nonstop, high-tech, souped-up war movie, with gung ho marines blasting special-effects creatures, and a genuinely convincing, exciting action heroine."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"For this movie stands to be something its predecessor was not, a megahit. And it deserves to be, for it is a remarkable accomplishment: a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,Truly great cinema- manages to dodge that 'dodgy sequel' curse with ease.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,I'm giving the movie a high rating for its skill and professionalism and because it does the job it says it will do. I am also advising you not to eat before you go to see it.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,100,"But of all the film's choices, the best was Weaver. She's its white-hot core, given fine, irascible dialogue to come blazing out of that patrician mouth, and the chance to look, for a moment, like a space-dusted Sleeping Beauty in her hyper-sleep casket."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,90,Director James Cameron dumps the decorative effects of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien in favor of some daring narrative strategies and a tight thematic focus.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,James Cameron's vault into the big time after scoring with the exploitation actioner The Terminator makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills - emphasis is decidedly on the plural aspect of the title.
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,"The startling thing about ""Aliens"" is how obsessed it is with women as child bearers. It's  the theme that allows the movie to have all the trappings of a typical science fiction/action movie while creating a primal emotive connection for the audience."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,88,"Under the direction of James (''The Terminator'') Cameron, [the special effects team has] put together a flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Cameron isn't as concerned with scares or atmosphere, the staples of traditional horror films, as he is with setting up difficult situations for his characters to get out of, leaving audiences deliciously on edge."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Cruder than the original, Aliens is a distinctly greedy mega-production."
Aliens,8.4,85160248,80,"Toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn`t want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"As potential blockbusters go, Batman v Superman is neither as stupid nor as stupendous as it might have been."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,Batman v Superman lacks the levity (forced or otherwise) of a typical Marvel Universe entry. But Snyder's superpowered epic does have a sense of import and grandeur about it.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"When it sings, “Dawn of Justice” is a wonder. When it drags, it still looks good and offers hints of a better scene just around the corner."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"Better than Man of Steel but below the high bar set by Nolan's Dark Knight, Dawn of Justice is still a colossus, the stuff that DC Comics dreams are made of for that kid in all of us who yearns to see Batman and Superman suit up and go in for the kill."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,75,"BvS will please those either waiting for the two main players to lock horns on a movie screen, or those who've just been pining for Wonder Woman forever. And for the nerdier crowds, a fleeting glimpse at other superheroes hints this is the Dawn of something potentially sensational."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,70,"The director, a strong technician whose slam-bang emphatic, occasionally operatic style seems made for comic book adaptations, has been well-served by an adept script co-written by Chris Terrio (an Oscar winner for Ben Affleck's ""Argo"") and David S. Goyer, which raises a number of interesting issues."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,70,"Snyder has set a Sisyphean task for himself. That this very long, very brooding, often exhilarating and sometimes scattered epic succeeds as often it does therefore has to be seen as an achievement."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,63,"Once Batman v Superman hits its stride, most viewers will feel equal parts pummeled and immersed. Snyder is a master of the dark spectacle and he pours it on starting around the movie’s midpoint.... Still, although viewers may be riveted at times, the net experience isn’t much fun."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,63,This is a comic book epic with a lot of fat and flab around the edges. But the fights are shorter and more involving than the “Transformers” cluttered clashes of “Man of Steel.”
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,63,"There are a few brilliantly realized moments, the acting is mostly strong despite the weak script (Affleck and Cavill are both superb—Affleck unexpectedly so), and there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; but if you aren't, “Batman v. Superman” will seem like a missed opportunity."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"This movie isn’t nearly as terrible as I was expecting, largely due to Snyder’s OCD-level attention to the visual details. And, yes, due to Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot), who brings in a badly needed dose of “Dragon Tattoo”-style female energy."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"This is a movie that, to its detriment, takes itself very, very seriously for most of its running time."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"Yes, questions regarding violence and mayhem are drowned out by violence and mayhem. Such is the superhero life as directed by Zack Snyder. There is no problem that can't be solved with a cranium-rattling explosion or two."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"While Batman v Superman has no trouble quickening the pulse, it’s less effective when it comes to making you care."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"It’s tough to take all the hardcore emoting seriously, particularly as the emotional heavy lifting is designed to be done by the occasional maudlin line in brief pauses between the explosions. For a film so concerned with its characters’ inner lives, there’s a fundamental disconnect going on here – enough to make you yearn for the lighter touch of the Marvel films."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,60,"There are moments that make the whole enterprise worthwhile, and introduces an intriguing new Batman. But it’s also cluttered and narratively wonky; a few jokes wouldn’t have gone amiss, either."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,58,"I get that this mano a supermano story line is a sacred text among comic-book aficionados, but Dawn of Justice doesn’t do the tale any favors. It’s overstuffed, confusing, and seriously crippled by Eisenberg’s over-the-top performance."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,55,"That face-off between two comics legends becomes but one in a series of big things bashing into other big things, which is what Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer mistake for storytelling. The trio do manage to cough up an acceptable number of ooh-that’s-cool moments, and fans who will be satisfied with those will be satisfied with those, but any other ideas and characters the movie might offer get lost in the rubble."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"It plants a flag for a new corporate entertainment franchise and it will make international containerships of money, so does it matter that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is joyless and incoherent? Probably not."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"Of course, the film is critic-proof, but as a longtime comic book (and film) nerd, I can say with some surety that Snyder has crammed too much of a great thing into his film, resulting in a super-slog that has just too much of everything."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"A sequel that functions as origin story, apologia, and harbinger of a second expanded universe of overpopulated action bonanzas."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"I recommend “Batman v. Superman” to anyone who thought director Zack Snyder showed too much restraint in “300,” who felt “Man of Steel” whisked by too briefly or who wondered how Ben Affleck could be made to seem one of America’s most animated actors while clenching his jaw as tight as a Christmas nutcracker."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was supposed to settle a fanboy debate older than Adam West. Instead it raises another: Is being a superhero really this much of a drag?
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"The movie's not bad but it doubles down on its least-interesting and potent elements at the expense of those that actually work. In the end, the film is as forgettable as the dime-store philosophy that fuels it."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"While “300"" maestro Snyder puts together some very striking scenes — which may be enough for many fanboys — they never really cohere into a whole. He literally throws in the kitchen sink in a film that frantically introduces characters and concepts while never clearly establishing the rules of the DC Comics universe."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,50,"This huge, unwieldy movie is busy and overcrowded."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"I’m not sure how a filmmaker whose work normally speaks to me as clearly as Snyder’s does could deliver something that feels this confused, this impersonal, and this corporate. It is a confounding mess of a movie, and while there are individual sequences that I enjoyed as isolated moments, it is almost breathtakingly incoherent storytelling."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Batman V Superman takes a title fight kids of all ages have been speculating about for decades—costumed titan from the cosmos, meet costumed vigilante from the city—and invests it with all the fun of a protracted custody battle."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice isn’t a film. It’s a two-and-a-half-hour movie trailer. Better yet, it’s one of those videos that pop up on screens before a ride at Universal Studios, where all the actors speak to you and keep hinting at bigger things to come — you know, like a ride? Basically, it’s everything the SEO-friendly title promises — and more."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice is an extraordinarily odd, idiosyncratic movie that presents aggressive, even warlike concepts of Batman and Superman without entirely justifying the eccentric visions."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,42,"Rather than focusing on a cataclysmic showdown between pop culture's most famous men in tights, Zack Snyder's flashy, cacophonous follow-up to 2013's ""Man of Steel"" is basically one long teaser for the next installment."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"The winner, on points, is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), who crashes the party and leaves them both dumbfounded, not least because she has the wit, and the wherewithal, to confront evil while wearing a conical bustier."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"Everything looks incredible, but the players are all just ciphers for ideas that Snyder lacks the wherewithal to execute."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"There’s enough going on to keep you watching — and, as I said, to keep fanboys wowed by the scale of the production and pretension. But most people will leave feeling drained and depressed, wondering how a studio can get away with withholding so much."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"It's all angst and no adventure, a lot of fury and little fun."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,Batman v Superman lunges for greatness instead of building toward it: It’s so topheavy with false portent that it buckles under its own weight.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"In Snyder’s formulation, protecting the world from evil isn’t a gift or a calling; it’s a burden. And that feeling is reflected in the movie itself, a burdensome 150-minute slog about two men fighting over who is in the right when both are very clearly in the wrong."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"No major blockbuster in years has been this incoherently structured, this seemingly uninterested in telling a story with clarity and purpose."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"Gorging on bombast and self-importance, swamped by its own mythology, Batman v Superman is loud, sprawling, and distracted. The action jumps around almost as fast as a man can fly, but nowhere near as smoothly."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"The villain here, Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, is so intensely annoying that, very early on, you wish Batman and Superman would just patch up their differences and join forces to put the squirrely rascal out of his, and our, misery."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,40,"If there’s any justice, dawning or otherwise, at the multiplex, audiences will reject Zack Snyder’s lumbering, dead-on-arrival superhero mélange, a $250 million tombstone for a genre in dire need of a break."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,38,"The film might be pretty to look at, but narratively speaking, it is a disaster."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,38,Many decisions...make “Batman v Superman” a joyless slog.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,38,"Snyder is not without skills, or ideas, but when a critic finds himself at odds with almost every aspect of a director’s visual approach to material like this, material like this becomes pretty joyless."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,37,"Strip away the trite character beats, rote plot points, random dream sequences and other narrative padding, and “Batman v Superman” comes down to the actors, their characters and whether they can sustain interest over the long haul. The answer is yes, if they wind up in the hands of filmmakers blessed with authentic imagination rather than serviceable technical chops."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,36,"Batman v Superman addresses Man Of Steel's problems in words without learning anything from it in tone. Instead, the new film doubles down on the grimness, the ugliness, and the indifference to human life."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,30,It is about as diverting as having a porcelain sink broken over your head.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,25,"“Batman v Superman” is an insanely long and convoluted action movie, made worse by an air of importance. It’s dispiriting and visually bland."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,20,"Spasms of highfalutin philosophy, and howlingly pretentious dream sequences, serve only as the thinnest of veneers for incessant action in one of the most assaultive movies ever made."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,16,It is a movie ostensibly about consequences that never lingers long enough on its own story to consider that the things happening in the narrative present ought to have consequences as well. Very little matters; very little makes sense.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,6.5,330360194,10,"To put it delicately, this comics fan hated Batman v Superman with the fury of a thousand red-dwarf suns. Blunt, humorless, and baffling, it collides the brutish directorial stamp of its director (he of 300 and Watchmen fame) with the most shameless instincts of our latter-day superhero franchise bubble."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,100,"McQuarrie understands that these films are essentially tall tales with a sense of humor, skating on the edge of parody at all times while maintaining a poker face."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,100,"I would argue that this may be the funniest of the films overall, and with Robert Elswit shooting it, it's absolutely gorgeous, with crisp, clean action choreography that you can actually see."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,90,"The action scenes are predictably magnificent, and an excellent supporting turn from fetching new cast member Rebecca Ferguson helps make this a sexy, propulsive, top-notch thriller."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,90,"The formula of ingredients is familiar and time-tested, to be sure, but some cocktails go down much better than others and McQuarrie and company have gotten theirs just right here."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,90,"At once questioning and reaffirming the pleasures of cinematic espionage, this is the rare sequel that leaves its franchise feeling not exhausted but surprisingly resurgent at 19 years and counting."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,"Cruise is as watchable as ever, bringing to Hunt a blend of steeliness and vulnerability."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,The most assured and satisfying of the five so far.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,"At times the deception and the intrigue and the twists and turns make it nearly impossible follow every detail of the plot, but even when things get muddled, we know Ethan’s our hero."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,88,"[I] enjoyed McQuarrie’s ingenuity in construction, smiled occasionally at the jokes and admired Ferguson’s performance as the most interesting femme fatale in the series."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,84,"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation never pretends to be anything but a solidly entertaining collection of fighting, chasing, driving, falling and going-to-the-place-and-getting-the-thing. But at that level, it delivers completely. Choose to accept it."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"Most impressively, ""Rogue Nation"" keeps the body count minimal."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"The man is a movie star, underline it twice. Cruise is this young century's personification of what it takes to earn that title, a perfect storm of personality, drive and talent on delivery, incapable of irrelevance."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"The M:I films remain blessedly, unfashionably self-contained: They’re stand-alone popcorn entertainments that can be watched in any order, with only the thinnest of connecting continuity between them."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,83,"Rogue Nation may not be the best, the tightest, or even the most logically coherent M:I flick, but there should be more movies like it: relentlessly thrilling, smart entertainments for folks who can’t tell the difference between Quicksilver and The Flash—and aren’t particularly interested in trying to learn the difference either."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"Perhaps more than any of the M:I directors so far, McQuarrie understands the unique properties of this singular movie star — his ascetic intensity, his sometimes-scary moral certainty, his always-scary drive to excel. The result of their collaboration is a briskly paced and witty reminder of why we go see summer action movies in the first place."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"McQuarrie is adept at keeping things moving and has overseen two areas where ""Rogue Nation"" stands out from the crowd."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"The perfect summer action flick. It’s full of attractive people, gorgeous locations, loathsome bad guys and a pounding score that ties it all together. This is what the “Fast and Furious” movies want to be, and the Bond pictures used to."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"Easily, almost nonchalantly, best in franchise, Rogue Nation dispenses with the dead weight of realism or relevance for state-of-the-art thrill-making in a classical mould. The series has finally found its voice."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,80,"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation might have its hi-tech gadgets, but it's a pleasingly old-fashioned affair."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Physically ripped, constantly engaged and possessing a quite possibly insane desire to do each and every one of his own stunts, Cruise is the platonic ideal of an action star. And thank god for that."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation doubles as a two-hour celebrity episode of American Ninja Warrior for Tom Cruise.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Rogue Nation unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure — you settle into it like a favorite chair."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"The great strength of McQuarrie is that, even when he’s leaning into the laughs, he plays it straight — he doesn’t sacrifice inviolable core values in the name of escapism, whether in the form of smart writing or superb production aesthetics."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"McQuarrie devises a film that’s a succession of riveting sequences, filmed in a way that’s active and yet elegant. The camera keeps moving within shots, but not in a subjective, jittery way, but rather like a third person narrator calmly emphasizing the essential points."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,The film offers everything one could ask for from popcorn entertainment.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"McQuarrie — an Oscar winner for his script for 1995's ""The Usual Suspects"" — has an ace to play. That's the indie sensibility he brings to the usual Hollywood FX."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,It can't resist winking at how this franchise manages to defy the limits of both human endurance and its superstar's rickety public status.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Ultimately, as inconsequential as it all is, Rogue Nation is not pretending to be anything it isn’t. And as a sensory escapist experience with laughs, pleasures, and excitement, Rogue Nation will likely be a most satisfying mission audiences choose to accept repeatedly."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,75,"Rogue Nation plays out like a sufficient rejigging of the same variables tossed around many times before, which is just enough to both celebrate the material and demonstrate its limitations."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"Of the many heists and grabs that litter the movie, none is as blatant as the deft, irrepressible manner in which Ferguson, displaying a light smile and a brisk way with a knife, steals the show. Poor Tom Cruise. He can’t even steal a kiss."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"It’s a diverting ride, played out against spectacular locations, that repackages a whole bunch of familiar elements and attitudes: A little latter-day Bond, a little Jason Bourne, a little John le Carré, a little 1950s Hitchcock."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, “Rogue Nation” is pretty much like most of the “Impossible” movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"The best reason to see Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation is Rebecca Ferguson, a Swedish-born actress passing easily as a British spy named Ilsa."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"It’s amazing, and genuinely touching. At the age of 53 Mr. Cruise continues to give his all to these films, and his all in this latest episode is more than enough."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"McQuarrie delivers a tense, eye-popping amusement-park ride that’s almost as exciting as it is forgettable."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,70,"The older Cruise gets, the more he relies on his fists. (And his abs, and his nerves — he'll never let you forget he does his own stunts, and why should he?) His body is the wonder-gizmo, and Christopher McQuarrie, writer and director of the fifth entry, Rogue Nation, keeps the camera on him like a nature show about a hungry lion."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,67,"Once you accept the fact that “Rogue Nation” is not going to be the wingding of the franchise, it becomes a lot easier to enjoy."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,67,"Overall, Rogue Nation is a solid, mildly subversive entry into the series that will have you humming Lalo Schifrin’s indelible theme music for the rest of the week, but probably not lingering over the finer points of the plot."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,63,"There's a difference between velocity and momentum, and while the chases, shootouts and close-quarters combat rarely flag, our interest does."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,63,The movie is better when it’s poking sly fun at Cruise’s superheroic screen persona (look at the expression on his face when Ethan realizes just how big the guy he must fight is) than when it asks you to buy into its far-fetched antics.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,60,"A sequel that is slick with silliness, but peppered with enough wit and peril to sustain the franchise’s momentum."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,60,Rogue Nation is an uneven film.
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,60,"Its fuse fizzes dutifully from A to B, but the dynamite never ignites."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,50,"Neither bad enough to be a complete waste of time nor good enough to remember past next Tuesday, the film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie staples together one routine action piece after another with cutesy dialogue and lots of merciless pounding away at iPad screens."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,50,"Jokier and more obviously derivative, Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation is the funniest “MI” picture, and maybe the worst of the series."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,7.4,195042377,40,By the third act all the stone-stepping plot points that get us from set-piece A to set-piece B start to wear thin.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,100,Edge of Tomorrow is the ultimate metaphor about Tom Cruise’s career. You can’t kill this guy. He’ll just keep coming. And he remains arguably the biggest movie star in the world for a reason. He brings it.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,95,"A mix of forward-looking sci-fi, classic themes, deft plotting and superb writing and direction, Edge of Tomorrow may be the pure-pleasure blockbuster to beat this Summer."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,91,"The reason the film works is because it throws everything into the blender and comes up with something new, something that has a great lively sense of wit and humor to it, and it takes the time to fully explore its wild premise fully."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,90,"It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,88,"Liman keeps the action and surprises coming nonstop. OK, the end is a head-scratcher. Until then, Cruise and Blunt make dying a hugely entertaining game of chance."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,88,"The movie has an organic intelligence and a sense that it, too, exists outside of linear time. It seems to be creating itself as you watch it."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,85,"For a film about repetition, Edge of Tomorrow never feels tired or familiar."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,83,"An entertaining, effects-driven black comedy, with shades of ""Starship Troopers"" in its depiction of warfare as a futuristic turkey shoot, the movie is distinguished more by how fluidly it handles its high-concept premise than where it takes it."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,83,"Despite its terribly unimaginative title, Edge of Tomorrow is a surprisingly imaginative summer action movie."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,83,"Liman stages the chaotic action scenes, including several iterations of the beach assault, with clarity, precision, and wit. This is his best movie since 2002's ""The Bourne Identity."""
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,A furiously time-looping joy ride and the smartest action film of the early summer season.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"Edge of Tomorrow repeats itself without being repetitive, takes itself seriously while providing some laughs and offers plenty of action without short-changing us on the intelligence front."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"Crucially, Cruise knows just how to pace Cage’s shift from cowardly to courageous. Yes, we get cool effects and impressive machinery. But he and Liman add unexpected humor and genuine tension to the seasonal thrill of blowing stuff up."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"The breakneck pace leaves little room for meaningful character development... But there’s imagination, spectacle and thrills to spare."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"A playful and frantic science-fiction twister which mimics the best (Aliens, The Matrix, Groundhog Day) while offering something fresh and — most importantly — thrilling."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,80,"The pleasure of Edge of Tomorrow is that it’s not an action movie first and foremost, but rather a cheeky little puzzle picture in expensive-looking blockbuster drag."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"At its best, Edge of Tomorrow plays like a tripwire time-travel thriller. As it progresses, though, the built-in repetition can, and does, grow tedious."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven’t seen the last of him yet."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"The fact is that this is a pretty good summer-kablooie movie, and Cruise is better than pretty good in it."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"Offers a more satisfying cinematic experience than ""Oblivion."""
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"Edge of Tomorrow covers familiar ground with unexpected wit and economy, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi fantasy."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"I'm not sure Edge of Tomorrow holds much repeat viewing potential among teenage movie consumers, since the movie's a self-repeating entity to begin with. But once is fun."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"Like summer movies themselves, it’s become so easy to be glib in dismissing Tom Cruise. “Edge of Tomorrow” provides welcome and hugely entertaining evidence that he’s still a star of considerable gifts, and savvy enough not to let them be squandered just yet."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,Edge of Tomorrow may be the best video game movie ever made. Which is strange since it isn't actually based on a video game.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,75,"A Tom Cruise action flick with a strong female heroine and a sense of humor? Edge of Tomorrow has both of those, plus a “Groundhog Day’’-style gimmick that pays big dividends. Over and over."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"It’s probably no great loss, but here and elsewhere the seams show. And in this sort of movie it’s often more fun before we get our bearings and have time to say, “This makes no sense.”"
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"In Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. Liman brings Mr. Cruise’s smile out of semiretirement and also gives him the kind of physical challenges at which he so brilliantly excels."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"They might also have called it ""Groundhog Day 2,"" but that wouldn't have conveyed the film's martial frenzy, its fascinating intricacies or the special delights of its borderline-comic tone."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"Edge Of Tomorrow’s finale can’t live up to what’s come before, though that’s mostly because what comes before is so rich and unusual, particularly in the middle of a summer blockbuster season that doesn’t always value richness or novelty."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,70,"The Wile E. Coyote fatalities are fun, but it's that repetitive moment of horror that holds this bipolar stunt together: Cruise, bug-eyed and gasping for breath as he shakes off his fear and grimly prepares for the next suicide mission."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,67,"Cruise is better than he’s been in a while because he damps down his usual all-intensity-all-the-time MO. He’s best here when his character seems the most scared. And Emily Blunt as a commando legend is indomitable, a credit to her exoskeleton."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,67,"Edge of Tomorrow is slick, but once its fancy plot dressing takes form, it has little more to offer aside from a few impressive action sequences and the infallible grin of its nimble lead."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,63,"Cruise and Blunt have a measure of chemistry, however their characters go undeveloped, given short shrift amid the spectacle. But the pulse-pounding action scenes are briskly directed by Doug Liman."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,63,"Tom Cruise's participation transmutes, as it always does, everything around him, turning the movie's series of false starts, dead ends, and hard lessons into a working metaphor for his own career."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,63,Cruise and Blunt have only as much chemistry as the script allows.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,60,"Thank heavens, then, for the time-loop gimmick, which sustains a full hour of screen time with enough variations on its gambit to hook you in."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,60,The film’s Groundhog Day-meets-Independence Day plot is actually pretty genius.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,"Edge of Tomorrow isn’t good, but it’s also forgivable. Just please stop the ""Top Gun 2"" rumors, Tom. Please."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,"By design it’s monotonous, and with so much clunky hardware, Liman can’t generate the same pace he produced in the “Bourne” movies. Edge of Tomorrow has neither an edge nor a vision of tomorrow that matters today."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,I felt unable to decide between this movie is the most badass thing ever and OMG turn it off.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,This is an action flick for those who like form over substance in their popcorn movies which explode onscreen every summer.
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,50,"Although the humor helps, the Groundhog Day-like repetition gets tedious; it makes you feel more like a hamster than a groundhog — or rather a hamster's wheel, going round and round, over and over again."
Edge of Tomorrow,7.9,100206256,40,"It is basically deadly serious, and after some moderate knockaboutfun, settles into something pretty dull. Where's the edge?"
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,83,"If you accept that Rambo is not the same kind of movie as First Blood and watch it on its own merits, it’s a badass action movie."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,75,"It may be a dishonest, xenophobic, exploitative act of historical revisionism, but it's effective, and Jack Cardiff's cinematography lends Rambo's comic-book adventures an epic sweep."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,75,"The body count is rising, Sly's pecs are blowing up, and Rambo himself is becoming more of a brand-name than a character, a mascot for masochism and murderous self-assertion."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,60,"The charade on the screen, which is not pulled off, is to accept that the underdog Rambo character, albeit with the help of an attractive machine-gun wielding Vietnamese girl (Julia Nickson), can waste hordes of Vietcong and Red Army contingents enroute to hauling POWs to a Thai air base in a smoking Russian chopper with only a facial scar (from a branding iron-knifepoint) marring his tough figure."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,60,"Here is a film fully xenophobic, abhorrent film, touting guileless version of military honour, but with Jack Cardiff’s furtive camerawork and some excellent editing, it sucks you in to its disturbing heroic sweep."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,Rambo is an inane sequel to a fairly good melodrama; another example of an attempt to repeat an earlier success that goes wildly out of scale.
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,"To anyone who doesn't share the camera's adoration, this sort of behavior becomes so comic that Rambo turns into something of a camp classic."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,50,"The picture seems deliberately trite, blunt, and manipulative, as if the producers didn't trust their audience to respond to anything else."
Rambo: First Blood Part II,6.5,150415432,40,"All in all, it's a pretty offensive movie, especially to the Americans who fought in Vietnam."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,90,"Big, loud and full of testosterone-fueled car fantasies, Michael Bay's actioner hits a new peak for CGI work, showcasing spectacular chases and animated transformation sequences seamlessly blended into live-action surroundings."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,90,"Transformers is a wet dream for fanboys, with vehicles that whiz and whir into alien robots, spectacular sci-fi stunt chases, glistening military hardware, overheated computer software and brainy, hot girls who love Popular Mechanics."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,83,It's all about the sheer visceral rush of mega action.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,80,The movie's biggest misstep is a complete lack of the classic Transformers theme song. How do you not use the coolest ’80s toyline-turned-cartoon music ever?
Transformers,7.1,319071806,80,"The script may have rubbery legs, but the action is rock-hard. The surprise is the lightness of touch: treat as a comedy for best results."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"The whole thing is too giddy to be taken seriously and too much of a confection to leave much of a lasting impression. But for 140 minutes, at least, it should give non-fanboys at least an idea of what all the fuss is about."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"The energy never lets up, and two committed, unfussy leading actors are an improvement over other summer flicks."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Everything comes down to an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons, and that's when my attention began to wander, and the movie lost a potential fourth star."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,A classic Michael Bay mega-movie. Interested in plot and character development? Move along. You're blocking the view.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,Even more ridiculous than it sounds.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Yes, it's loud, explosive and silly, but it also perfectly embodies the concept of a summer blockbuster with its simple good-guys-vs.-bad-guys plot, cheeky humor and flawless special effects."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"The most surprising thing about Michael Bay's much-anticipated, blockbuster-bound Transformers is how funny the movie is."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,It's a heavy-metal opera with humor.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Grab some popcorn and make a pit stop, then sit back and enjoy it. You signed up for a movie about giant robots."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"LaBeouf is likable and grounded, two things you need from the lead in a film like this, although his female co-stars seem to have been cast based on how well their Maxim covers would sell."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,75,"Just about everything connected to this movie is a tie-in, except for the popcorn. And even then I'm not too sure."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"In previous movies, Michael Bay dabbled wearily in Homo sapiens. At last he has summoned the courage to admit that he has an exclusive crush on machines, and I congratulate him on creating, in Transformers, his first truly honest work of art."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,It's a wonderfully playful experience.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"Depending on your expectations for Transformers, rear-ending theaters this July 4th, you’ll either be ecstatic or horrified to learn that the movie hits on all three cylinders in convincing fashion."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"The final scene is pure teen wish fulfillment: Imagine making out with your girlfriend on the hood of your sentient Camaro, as your own personal robot bodyguard looks on fondly (all right, that part's a little creepy)."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,Transformers is mercilessly inhuman and completely hysterical from frame one.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,70,"For almost two hours of car chases and car wrecks and extraordinary animated transformation sequences that meld fluidly with live action, the welcome mat is out for Michael Bay's cheerfully dopey saga."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,67,"Bay, at heart, isn't a fantasist; he's a literal-minded maestro of demolition."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,63,"Partly impressive, partly inane buck-banging toy of a movie."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,63,The climax of Transformers contains all that is proficient and slick and all that is drecky and soulless in Bay's work.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,63,Some kind of mess...terpiece.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,50,Deafeningly loud and proudly silly epic.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,50,A movie of epically assaultive noise and nonsense.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,50,"8-year-olds of all ages, prepare to storm the multiplex!"
Transformers,7.1,319071806,42,Turns the franchise into a terrible '80s comedy.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,40,"Transformers' multiple earthling story lines are tedious and oddly lifeless, doing little besides marking time until those big toys fill the screen."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,40,Transformers is about as clever as an unplugged blender.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,40,The film has just enough collisions to be a crashing bore.
Transformers,7.1,319071806,38,"Louder, flashier, and more hollow than anything else out there."
Transformers,7.1,319071806,30,"Not a movie, just one gigantic commercial for Hasbro."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,80,"Keeps playing its two winning cards over and over again, and is smart enough to realise they are more than enough. The first is the giant animal carnage itself, which crackles with fun ideas and flourishes throughout. The second is the comic chemistry of a superbly picked cast who bring everyone in on the joke."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,75,"What makes Rampage especially enjoyable is the way it sneaks up on the audience. Before casting off every shred of dignity and abandoning itself to good-humored excess, the movie passes itself off as a reasonably serious science-fiction movie."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,72,"The filmmakers try to innovate largely by making the movie as toothless and easily digestable as possible. Nothing in the film is real enough to care about past the moment, or serious enough to trouble audience’s sleep. Maybe in a world that’s already full of real-life disasters, it’s innovative enough to make monumental destruction this much dumb, lightweight fun."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,70,"It takes some time for the action sequences to fully engage, but from about the movie’s midpoint, Peyton delivers a succession of staggering set pieces."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,67,This crazy-gleeful adventure jumps between grisly and cartoonish.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,67,"Johnson’s singular charisma—his way with a one-liner, the built-in special effect of his unreal physique—grounds Rampage in a consistent personality, even as the tone veers wildly from broadly comic to selectively sentimental to casually horrifying."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"When Johnson is doing that movie action star thing he does so well and giant animals are going enormous-mano-a-enormous-mano, there’s undeniably goofy fun to be had. You just have to be patient during the downtime."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"It’s big, bloated, and, if you give in to the familiar charms of its jacked leading man, not unenjoyable. (Alternately, you could easily just let it induce a little nap.)"
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"The engaging dynamic between our hero and his gargantuan, computer-generated pal is the movie’s best surprise, with silly and straight bits both working mostly as intended for director Brad Peyton (Johnson’s “Journey 2” and “San Andreas”)."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"Only two things need to be said about Rampage: It’s really terrible, and I enjoyed it immensely."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,63,"Per usual, Johnson is the key cog of a movie built for his physical presence, but it's the relationship between Davis and George that fuels the plot, even when everything around them gets convoluted and haphazard."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Not that you would anyway, but it doesn't pay to think too hard about ""Rampage."" Sure, it could be improved (shorter would have helped), but it gets the job done in a more or less acceptable way. Not the highest praise, but things could have been worse."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Rampage was always going to be the cinematic equivalent of junk food – enjoyable enough while consumed, but devoid of nourishment. When the homo sapiens are on screen, you can feel the film start to flatline but, against the odds, a computer-generated gorilla might just win you over."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"It is entertainingly over the top, although perhaps the CGI work isn’t quite out of the top drawer."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Ridiculous, of course, but not as ridiculous as it might have been. As much fun as it has with the idea of animals stomping cities to rubble, it seems shy of going completely over the top, and it’s the poorer for it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,"Rampage won’t set the world on fire (our world, at least; it sets plenty of its world on fire when George and his two giant pals arrive in Chicago), but it does exactly what it says on the tin: It’s a big, goofy romp about creatures who lay waste to a major American city while the Rock cracks jokes in a light brown shirt."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,60,Morgan's performance is a gem of comic timing and audience-directed winks. He elevates a movie that’s mostly about watching stuff get stomped down.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,55,"Rampage doesn’t really offer much of anything new as a giant monster movie, a video game adaptation, or a Dwayne Johnson vehicle, but it still checks all the boxes expected from it, offering one just enough entertainment value to not make you completely hate it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"It’s both a blindingly predictable pastiche of an action movie — absolutely nothing happens here that you haven’t seen in a movie before, with the possible exception of some crass sign-language humor from a giant gorilla — and weirdly charming."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"Clearly, this is a star vehicle — and the eminently likable Johnson is unquestionably a star. Through sheer force of personality, he elevates Rampage into something reasonably entertaining."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,It's easy to root for George. The movie deserves the finger.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"The problem with Rampage is that it’s not content to be mindless fun. There’s too much exposition and too many needless human villains. Plus, the tone is more lugubrious than the flippancy suggested by the trailers."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"In the right moments, Brad Peyton can stage a ceremoniously ludicrous set piece with grace and ease. It’s easy to follow the nonsense found in the last act thanks to his assured hand, and you can tell that he is having an absolute ball with its silliness. If only we could share in that enthusiasm for its tedious first two acts."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,50,"The gargantuan critters are dwarfed only by the derivativeness in Rampage, a clunky spectacle that, like many Dwayne Johnson vehicles, is elevated by his charismatic presence but not enough to recommend it."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,46,This is a ridiculous movie without much desire or energy to get too ridiculous.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,42,"It never makes up its mind whether it wants to be a what-hath-science-wrought disaster movie like those old John Sayles cheapie classics Piranha and Alligator, or just a big, dumb, and loud tongue-in-cheek action comedy. It’s a movie that’s afraid to pick a lane."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"The bulk of Rampage is, alas, a slog, as passionless as I’d imagine the fandom is for the I.P. the film is based on."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Rampage is noticeably in trouble once it becomes obvious that the giant virtual gorilla is the most human presence onscreen, and that doesn’t take too long."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Compared to Rampage, King Kong and Godzilla have James Brown levels of soul. Peyton has just made another movie about the Rock running through rubble."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Seriously, the movie is pretty awful, but Johnson, as ever, seems to be having a ball, even when he’s all serious and concerned and shot up and beaten up and building-dropped-upon."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,The movie is at its best when it’s sopping with sentimentality and when it goes right over the top in its depiction of dorky destruction. Everything in between is a drag.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Some movies are feasts. Some films are desserts. This picture is cheese in a can, and if it only accepted that, it would be a lot more fun — like “Alligator,” the tongue-in-cheek classic that had a toothy terror climbing out of a city sewer."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Peyton delivers a unified-looking whole, in which the visual effects integrate well with stage and location work."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,40,"Rampage is a movie that gets buried in its own top-heavy plot, collapsing itself under that weight just like the Chicago-area buildings do on screen."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,A hopelessly bland and bizarrely self-serious monster movie.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,"Rampage might not be the worst movie of the year so far, but it’s a contender for most pointless."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,"Unlike 2014’s Godzilla, which benefited from director Gareth Edwards’s patience with the Jaws-style slow burn, RAMPAGE is all noise without crescendo."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,38,Rampage is a drag.
Rampage,6.1,99345950,37,"At times, Rampage almost hides its problems. It’s just funny enough, just exciting enough and just visually impressive enough. What it never is, though, is anything more than just enough."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,33,"It’s the worst kind of ridiculous: not enough so to be memorably fun, but far too much so to be taken with any degree of gravitas."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"The plot is cursory, the dialogue is repetitive and the psychology is cheap. Hanging in for the wanton violence may prove too much for anyone not seriously addicted to the guilty pleasures of cheesy sci-fi."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"It’s not convincing, not impressive, and after “Jumanji,” Johnson’s agents will probably never let him within a city block of Brad Peyton."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,25,"What does Rampage have? No satisfying action beats, no memorable images, and so little to say that it’s virtually impossible to say anything about it in return. It’s not a movie for critics, that much is clear. The problem is that it’s not for anyone else, either."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"Rampage is a big, noisy nothing—an action extravaganza that fails at being funny just as hard as it fails at being serious."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"I’m not terribly convinced that the overtly campy version of this film would be any better, but I’m very certain that this one is bad."
Rampage,6.1,99345950,20,"You know what might make an intriguing, revealing movie? The story of how, over 30 years after its debut, a relatively innocent arcade game starring a giant ape and other oversize beasts underwent a corporate transmogrification and became a turgid, logy sci-fi/action blockbuster."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,88,"The plot of Point Blank, summarized, invites parody (rookie agent goes undercover as surfer to catch bank robbers). The result is surprisingly effective."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,88,"At her best—and even in a hand-me-down project like Point Break—Bigelow is a uniquely talented, uniquely powerful filmmaker. Where the male action directors are still playing with toys-with dolls and models and matte shots-Bigelow has tapped into something primal and strong. She is a sensualist of genius in this most sensual of mediums."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,75,"Point Break, though it's anything but watertight where plotting is concerned, again reveals Ms. Bigelow's real talents as a director of fast-paced, high-adrenaline action. Whenever the flakiness of Point Break threatens to become lulling, Ms. Bigelow wakes up her audience with a formidable jolt."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,75,"In terms of Hollywood history, Bigelow's film is the perfect document of its time."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,70,"What saves Point Break from wipeout is Kathryn Bigelow's direction. Though the film lacks the formal beauty and allure of her Near Dark and Blue Steel, Bigelow keeps the action percolating in high style."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,70,Director Kathryn Bigelow is one of the new-style action wizards who’ve never quite mastered the nuts and bolts of telling a story.
Point Break,7.2,43218387,63,"Point Break has its areas of excitement, but on too many occasions the movie just lies there -- even when it does, however, the film still manages to look and sound good."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,63,"A lot of what Bigelow puts up on the screen bypasses the brain altogether, plugging directly into our viscera, our gut. The surfing scenes in particular are majestically powerful, even awe-inspiring. Bigelow's picture is a feast for the eyes, but we watch movies with more than our eyes. She seduces us, then asks us to be bimbos."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,63,"Bigelow stages the film's action sequences with a brutal efficiency (they almost redeem the movie), but she can't keep the increasingly silly script in check."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,58,"For an hour or so, Bigelow (Near Dark, Blue Steel) gets by on that great eye of hers. But about halfway, Point Break breaks down. The plot, which has been unimpressive but not irritating, becomes maddeningly implausible. And the performances, which had been generally engaging, lose their edge."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,50,"A hare-brained wild ride through big surf and bad vibes, Point Break acts like a huge, nasty wave, picking up viewers for a few major thrills but ultimately grinding them into the sand via overkill and absurdity."
Point Break,7.2,43218387,50,"It's a movie that's almost all style, all technique. It doesn't seem to be inhabited by people, thoughts or feelings, but by great coruscating patterns of light crashing over and over us, repeatedly--almost, but not quite, drowning out a constant buzz of cliches."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,100,"Not just a reboot - it's a rejuvenation. From the first image of sensory awakening to the final acceptance of adult responsibility, it pulses with the warm blood of a very human hero."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,91,"What's most amazing in The Amazing Spider-Man turns out to be not the shared sensations of blockbuster wow! the picture elicits, but rather the shared satisfactions of intimate awww."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,88,Did we need another Spider-Man this quickly? Debatable. But if you wanted a new interpretation – especially one where story and action stay in the right balance – this is it.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,88,"This is a more thoughtful film, and its action scenes are easier to follow in space and time. If we didn't really need to be told Spidey's origin story again, at least it's done with more detail and provides better reasons for why Peter Parker throws himself into his superhero role."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"This fourth installment is a complete reboot, returning to the web-slinger's creation story, and Garfield, more than any other factor, contributes to the sense of a bleaker vision along the lines of ""The Dark Knight."""
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"None of this is new to us, but Garfield and Webb make it feel convincingly fresh and exciting."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"Director Marc Webb's action-adventure is grounded in a recognizable reality, but is also full of thrills. It's dark and mysterious, but doesn't skimp on fun."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"The film is also faithful to the smartassery of the Spider-Man of the comics, and Garfield's spindly physicality evokes the Marvel illustrations of the 1960s."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,Meet the new face of superheroes: Marc Webb's totally teenage and totally fun take on the Spider-Man franchise.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"A mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"While the two leads deliver the goods and manage to combine a frisky sense of first love with the movie's gloomier arc, they are well-served by a terrific supporting cast."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,"It isn't perfect but this reboot's wins outweigh its wobbles. The leads charm, the action crackles and the grooves are well-laid for part two. Untold story? Next time, then."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,80,It's the successul synthesis of the two – action and emotion – that means this Spider-Man is as enjoyable as it is impressive: Webb's control of mood and texture is near faultless as his film switches from teenage sulks to exhilarating airborne pyrotechnics.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,"The Amazing Spider-Man is fun, as any summer movie amusement ride can be. But it left me feeling the same as Raimi's version; that groundwork has been dutifully laid for a winning franchise in need of a few surprises."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,"This is the second-best Spider-Man movie yet made. In the previous trilogy, only ""Spider-Man 2"" surpasses it."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,The whiz-bang stuff doesn't kick in until the Peter-Gwen relationship (which is the best thing in the movie) is firmly established.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,"More honourable than ""amazing,"" the latest reboot of the Spider-man franchise brings Marvel Comics web-slinging super-hero down to earth, in a mostly satisfactory way."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,"As a new chapter in the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,"When a new actor slips on the Spandex for a superhero franchise reboot, we should, you know, notice. And we do with Andrew Garfield."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,75,Part of the reason The Amazing Spider-Man feels so fresh and invigorating is that its story is so simple - anyone remember exactly what the deal was with Loki and that cube? - and its protagonist so relatable.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,70,This might be a fun summer blockbuster if only it even remotely needed to exist.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,70,Pretty good summer flick!
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,70,Probably not as good as you hoped or as bad as you feared.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,70,Watching Garfield swinging through New York or toying with criminals after he captures them is reason enough to welcome another telling of the tale.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,70,"I've saved the best for last: The love interest played by that throaty redheaded (here blonde) darling Emma Stone, whose blue eyes radiate so much intelligence that any actor on whom she trains them in adoration becomes an instant movie star."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,67,"The Amazing Spider-Man is agreeable.  And occasionally it's more.  But, as with the American remake of the Swedish film of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" you can't help but feel that you've not only heard the story before, but that you you've seen it before, too -- and recently."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,63,Don't come to The Amazing-Spider-Man looking for originality.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,63,"The good news is that Garfield and Stone whip up a warm, convincing froth as two teenagers caught up in a beguiling case of puppy love. The not-so-great news is that by ""reboot,"" the studio means taking audiences once again through every step of Peter's transformation into Spider-Man."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,63,"Webb never loses touch with the film's emotional through line. And he allows time and space for Garfield and Stone, both stellar, to turn a high-flying adventure into something impassioned and moving. A Spider-Man that touches the heart. Now that really is amazing."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,60,"On the whole, it's passable stuff, a surprise, given how mechanical the masked character seemed."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,60,"Mr. Webb's Spider-Man movie works only because he keeps the whole package, at least until the requisite final blowout, tethered to his two appealing leads."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,60,"The problem is that the film must re-establish a great deal of mythology, much of which is already familiar to most moviegoers. Unfortunately, Webb's film never quite makes usshake the feeling that we've done all this before."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,60,There are joyous moments when we share Peter's point of aerial view.
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,60,"The result is that ""Spider-Man"" goes in and out of focus. This is a film that is memorable in pieces but not as a whole."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,60,"Graced with great performances from Garfield and Stone, The Amazing Spider-Man is a rare comic-book flick that is better at examining relationships than superheroism. If it doesn't approach the current benchmark of Avengers Assemble, it still delivers a different enough, enjoyable origin story to live comfortably alongside the Raimi era."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,50,"The Amazing Spider-Man, helmed by ""(500) Days Of Summer"" director Marc Webb, doesn't put its own stamp on the material, which feels warmed-over in ways that don't help."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,50,"For me, this is as deflating a movie as I have seen all year. Not the worst, to be sure, but a project so utterly unnecessary that it made me want to gnash my teeth in frustration."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,50,"Sometimes dull and mostly uninspired, it's much less a satisfying reboot like ""Batman Begins'' than a pointless rehash in the mode of ""Superman Returns.''"
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,50,"No mutation is necessary to clearly see that Marvel's ""reboot"" of their signature franchise is an unimaginative remake of Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,40,"This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise, but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie, what's old is old again."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,38,"Dumbed down, tarted up, and almost shockingly uninspired, it's the worst superhero movie since ""Green Lantern."""
The Amazing Spider-Man,7.0,262030663,30,"In short, the character is a lot like the way Stan Lee first envisioned him, but the trilogy's screenwriter Steve Ditko would probably loathe this new, unsatisfying, and hollow-feeling entry into the new cinematic Marvel Universe."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,"It's a movie of such jaw-dropping violence, wild improbability and dazzling style it overpowers all resistance."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,"Oldboy is a powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,Park's direction is flawless and Jung Jung-hoon's cinematography is stunning.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,100,Startling and amazing -- a cinematic hammer to the skull.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,90,"Whatever its oversteps and excesses (I do think Park ran a little amok with the computer gimcrackery), Oldboy has the bulldozing nerve and full-blooded passion of a classic."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,90,"Anguished, beautiful and desperately alive, Oldboy is a dazzling work of pop-culture artistry."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,90,"It's a work of art for sure, but a sadistic one. Oldboy is one of the year's best; it just isn't for everyone. If you're still interested, go for it."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,88,"As always with Park Chanwook, you just hold on and let him rip."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,88,"Once the picture gets into Hollywood's bloodstream, it could well prove to be as influential as John Woo's 1989 crime thriller, ""The Killer."""
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,88,"This hunt for revenge is really a quest for self-discovery. The story, acting and brilliant directing elevate Oldboy into a human struggle to know yourself and your place in the universe, and to live with that sometimes terrible knowledge."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"A wild, intensely cinematic ride into two men's burning desire to get even."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"The result is a powerfully visceral experience that justifies itself almost entirely on surface chops, with striking color composition and a complex sound design that elevates the story to an operatic scale."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"Obviously, this sort of taboo-flouting imagery isn't for everyone, but Park's vision is all of a piece."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"This is absolutely not a film for all tastes, but it's a masterpiece of pitiless power whose audacious, ambiguous climax strikes a note of insane romanticism as haunting as it is perverse."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"You will surely leave this movie shocked, shaken and surprisingly moved. And definitely stuck on that poor octopus."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"Its magnificence is that it takes itself dead serious. It's not entertainment, but it's sure a piece of toughness."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,80,"While the climax is admittedly something of a letdown after all the build-up, it's a hopelessly, helplessly original film, all guts, no glory."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,78,"Regardless of how you look at Oldboy, it's unlike anything you are likely to have seen before."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,As mysterious as it is sinister.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,"More than anything else, Oldboy recalls Alfred Hitchcock with all restraint tossed to the wind, or Hitchcock's most obsessed devotee, Brian De Palma, at his most nastily inspired."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,"This nightmarish revenge drama from Korea is grueling, intense, cruel -- the very definition of extreme cinema."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,"This is a movie about draining, tenderizing and chopping up the audience emotionally."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,75,It says something when you come out of a film as weird and fantastical as Oldboy and feel that you've experienced something truly authentic. I just don't know what. I can't think of anything to compare it to.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,70,"It's just the kind of film that you'd expect a jury led by Quentin Tarantino to choose, a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,67,Oldboy has the fatal air of wanting so desperately to be a cult movie that it forgets to present itself as a coherent one.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,60,"Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It's an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,50,"Entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,50,"Despite its director's skill at staging trash with dash, Oldboy is too long and portentous to be an enjoyable B movie. The movie's self-seriousness short-circuits its sensationalism."
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,50,There's a lot less here than meets the eye.
Oldeuboi,8.4,707481,40,"Put simply, in my humble opinion, Oldboy sucks."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,80,"Top Gun is not so much a movie in the conventional sense as an escalating series of masterfully crafted adverts: motorcycles, aircraft carriers, pectorals and planes all look as if they’ve been shot for a particularly luminous beer campaign."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,80,"Set in the world of naval fighter pilots, pic has strong visuals and pretty young people in stylish clothes and a non-stop soundtrack."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,75,Top Gun has always been more than just an action flick about a cocky young fighter pilot who feels the need for speed.
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,75,"No doubt about it: Top Gun is going to be the hit that ""The Right Stuff"" should have been. They are not in the same class of films, but this much must be said: The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,63,"This is a movie that comes in two parts: It knows exactly what to do with special effects, but doesn't have a clue as to how two people in love might act and talk and think."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,63,"The flight sequences in “Top Gun” may arouse aerial buffs. Still, this movie approaches its subject in such juvenile, superficial way that it’s clear the producers were merely in a hurry to cash in on Hollywood’s new wave of Rambo-style patriotism."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,60,"The excitement is switched off on landing. Once Top Gun, which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, gets back to earth, the master of the skies is as clunky as a big land-bound bird."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,50,"What TOP GUN contributes to the genre is an increased emphasis on military hardware and an almost homoerotic attraction for male bodies, mostly sweaty ones."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,50,"Top Gun is about the training of the Navy's best fighter pilots and their blooding in cold war incidents, and the only thing Director Tony Scott has not brought up to date is the story. It is the one about the hotdog who has to be taught to be a team player. They were peddling that one before Writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. were born."
Top Gun,6.9,179800601,50,"Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact, but Scott doesn't display the slightest bit of interest (or belief) in the actual characters and situations."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,100,"One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,100,It’s a feat of pure cinematic necromancy.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,100,"It’s deeply silly but uproariously entertaining. At the end, I almost felt guilty for enjoying it all quite so much - almost."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,88,"Craig puts heat and heart into Spectre, as if he's taken Bond as far he can. The movie is a fever dream of all the Bond villains and all of Bond's efforts to see a life past them."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"This sophisticated sugar rush is the longest Bond film ever, but it cruises by with an elegant sense of danger. As with all of Daniel Craig’s 007 outings, it amps up the intelligence and tamps down the attitude."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"Though not as dramatically rich or emotionally compelling as Skyfall, Spectre still ranks as a sleek, pulse-pounding if slightly overlong entertainment."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,80,"Even if this is less satisfying overall than Skyfall, there are sequences that rank with Bond’s best."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"A Bond movie is all about delivering on expectations: to enjoy it you have to be pleased rather than frustrated by its predictability. In that regard, Spectre, Daniel Craig’s fourth outing as Bond and the second directed by Sam Mendes, can be deemed a solid success: not as darkly stylish as ""Skyfall"" but not as stupidly grim as ""Quantum of Solace"" either."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"Spectre is the most “traditional” of the Craig Bonds. Although a little light on gadgets, it has everything else,"
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"It's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,Spectre isn’t bad — just slightly disappointing.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,75,"For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"Anyone who has tamped down that youthful yen for excitement should stay away. But the craving for grownup glamour, however foolish, demands equal satisfaction, and Spectre, in providing it, acquires a throb of mystery that cannot be explained by mere plot."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"The new James Bond movie Spectre makes a satisfying final chapter to the four-film saga of Daniel Craig’s 007, even if that saga turns out to be less than the sum of its parts."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,It remains a decently robust and entertaining midlevel Bond movie — just one that's haunted by the specter of its predecessor.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"Spectre is still fun, the cast is top-flight. And had it been the first Bond film with Craig in the title role, the reaction likely would be ""wow!"" This is some good stuff, way deeper than the silly Bonds. But with history behind us, it feels a little slight."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"In the end, Spectre is just too much of a good thing. Though each scene is carefully wrought, there's little grace, majesty, or romance in the way the pieces are connected. The whole is bumpy and inelegant — entertaining for sure, but hard to love."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,70,"Bond has seen it all before, this team has done it all before, and the production juggernaut hits every beat with a carefully calibrated precision which can be deeply satisfying but also risk coming across as rote."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,67,"Not bad, no need to wake Roger Moore from his mid-morning nap and bring him out of retirement, but not special."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,67,"It’s possible that Skyfall created expectations that were too high for Spectre to match. But with all he’s done for the franchise, Craig deserves to go out with a bigger, smarter bang."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,67,"What Spectre lacks is the sinister magnetic pull of Skyfall, a Bond movie with real stakes and attitude and distinctive flavor, not to mention more mesmeric images than one can usually expect from this workmanlike blockbuster franchise."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,65,Spectre is a frustratingly unsatisfying experience.
Spectre,6.8,200074175,63,"The clichéd ghosts of James Bond past haunt Spectre, an action adventure whose biggest failure is looking back on 007’s own success."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,63,"All of its revisionism centrally incorporates the history of the franchise, and the film both excels and suffers for frequently recalling its forbears."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,63,"It's filled with big sets, big stunts, and what ought to be big moments, but few of them land."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"If Spectre has any saving grace, it’s Craig, who remains the best non-Connery Bond. It is not merely his physical presence, which is formidable enough; he has a unique ability to make peevishness dramatically compelling. And the subtlety of his sense of humor is one of the better aspects of his 007."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"Granted, there's comfort to be found in the familiarity of Mendes' film, which makes an effort to look back while also advancing the series. But there's a fine line between paying homage to the past and merely repeating it.... Spectre often crosses that line."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"The first act is great, full of dark portent and bravura film-making flourishes. However, the final hour disappoints, with too many off-the-peg plot twists and too many characters conforming to type."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,60,"An unbalanced but never less than entertaining film, enthralling and deflating in roughly equal measure, and studded with moments of true, old-school glory."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,58,"Even a subpar James Bond movie is worth seeing because, well, it’s James Bond. But if one of the most successful and long-running franchises in movie history wants to keep pumping, it’s once again time to change the formula."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"There’s nothing surprising in Spectre, the 24th “official” title in the series, which is presumably as planned. Much as the perfect is the enemy of good, originality is often the enemy of the global box office."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"Familiarity is not without its pleasures. But Spectre is so confused and inert that Craig can’t even sell the signature “Bond. James Bond” and “Shaken, not stirred” lines."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"Spectre, set up to be the Daniel Craig finale as Bond, isn’t a terrible installment in the franchise. It’s the lightest of the Craig Bonds — no sin in that. But like the end of Connery, the exit of Roger Moore and the layoff notice given Pierce Brosnan, it’s a tired, trite “greatest hits” re-packaging of stunts, chases and fights from earlier, better Bonds."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"I know the opening credits for a James Bond movie are supposed to be silly, but the start of Spectre achieves almost orgasmic levels of kitsch."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,50,"A drab, anemic machine, Spectre, may bring the spectacle, but it lacks a soul. Someone get Idris Elba on the phone."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,42,"Watching Spectre unfold, lumbering and slumbering, on the heels of a franchise high is a shock, so much talent coasting this time."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,42,"They have tried, with this Daniel Craig run of films, to elevate the Bond movies so they are more than just acceptably silly spy movies, and one of the reasons SPECTRE is so frustrating is because it feels like the collapse of that ambition, and it is in one moment that you can see the entire thing burn to the ground."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,42,"In general, this feels like a film patched together out of endless hastily-drafted script rewrites rather than a cohesive vision."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,40,"Yes, some of the individual stunts and action set pieces temporarily hold our interest...but the story itself is not convincing on its own terms, playing like a series of boxes (Bond asking for a martini shaken not stirred) that need to be checked off and forgotten."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,40,"Like Skyfall, Spectre is loaded with allusions to the previous films in the franchise, undoubtedly providing much glee for Bond fans. The nods, quips, and general formula that audiences have come to know soon becomes weary and tiring, however."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,38,"“A license to kill is also a license to not kill,” M lectures his new boss in the 24th James Bond film, Spectre. Well, it’s not a license to bore as much as this bloated drag manages to do."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,38,"At the center of the film, like a man trying to pull a donkey out of a peat bog, stands Craig: inexpressive, uninflected and obviously tired. Perhaps he’s trying to play a chap who never allows himself access to his emotions, for fear loved ones may be snatched away, but he just looks like an actor who wishes he could quit his job."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,37,"We don’t expect a James Bond film to be deep, but at least we should be dazzled by the seductive gloss of its surfaces. Aside from that stunning opening sequence, this installment feels overcompensating and dutiful."
Spectre,6.8,200074175,30,"Perhaps some of the goofiness was intentional — you can’t always tell from this production’s wavering tone — but Spectre is full of not-good things, and some oppressively bad things that may come to feel like drill bits twirling in your skull."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,100,"A ridiculously entertaining, perfectly paced, ultra-violent cinematic rush that kicks the places other movies struggle to reach."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,100,"It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big, shameless, audacious, compulsively watchable, irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,90,"Equal parts audacious dark comedy, wish-fulfillment fantasy and over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek action-adventure."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,90,"Kick-Ass moves with such bloody assurance that you'd be forgiven for not seeing how smart it is. But smart it is. Smart, important and deadly."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"The best superhero movie since ""The Dark Knight"" (and far less serious in tone or approach), Kick-Ass earns its name in every way."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"Maybe I enjoyed the similarly themed Kick-Ass because it took me back to that innocent time. Or maybe it's because this is the most brazenly funny bloodbath unleashed on the public since ""Pulp Fiction."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"Kick-Ass has punk energy, ace action moves, and a winning sense of absurdist fun."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,88,"A brutally funny deconstruction, a hybrid of “Watchmen” and “Superbad” filtered through John Woo. It’s a boisterously original piece of entertainment . . . that isn’t for everyone. Note the rating, which should be triple-R, as in Really, Remarkably R."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,83,"An enjoyably supercharged and ultraviolent teen-rebel comic-book fantasy that might be described -- in spirit, at least -- as reality-based."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,83,Director Matthew Vaughn has provided an imperfect but still wickedly hilarious take on Mark Millar's deconstruction of superhero mythos.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"A clever movie premise based on an obscure comic book has been turned into, okay we’ll say it, a fanboy’s kick-ass wet dream of a movie that could be a surprise Spring smash."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"Its balancing act between innocence and gore perfectly matches the expectations of genre fans, who should embrace the movie."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"For those of us who find somber superhero movies faintly ridiculous, Kick-Ass is a one-film justice league."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"It's also perfectly content to be an insanely violent, funny take on an established genre. And in that respect, Kick-Ass lives up to its name."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"This shrewd mixture of slick comic-book mayhem, unmistakable sweetness and ear-splitting profanity is poised to be a popular culture phenomenon because of its exact sense of the fantasies of the young male fanboy population."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,80,"With Kick-Ass, there are more cheap thrills, gory explosions and superheroes than a movie geek's YouTube mash-up."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"Kick-Ass is a rabid puppy of a movie, energetically bounding off the screen and into your lap, where it proceeds to chew off your face."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,Kick-Ass reminds you of the great pleasures and thrills of superhero comics -- then turns everything you ever learned from comic books upside down.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"Irresponsible, morally murky, and batshit insane--in other words, Kick-Ass might be the most fun two hours you’ll spend in a movie theater. It delivers the darkly comic laughs (the movie is clearly not taking itself too seriously, so you should do likewise) as well as the jaw-dropping action, but Kick-Ass’s real accomplishment is bringing back the winkingly crazy Nic Cage we used to know and love."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"Kick-Ass should delight fans of the original comics and garden-variety action junkies as well. Suggested subtitle: ""Iron Man, You Just Got Served."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,It's irreverently entertaining.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,"The movie belongs to Moretz, whose sensational performance will be talked about for years. Her scenes with Cage, who wears a Batsuit and uses a voice borrowed from Adam West, are a hoot."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,75,Kick-Ass is some kind of twisted fun.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,70,"Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things, and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,70,A particularly timely story about civic-mindedness and the pursuit of fame. Along with a lot of potty-mouthed ass-kicking action.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,70,Ms. Moretz is by far the best thing about the film: she holds the screen as gracefully as she executes a running back flip.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,63,"Fusing teen comedy, bad-boy raunch, Tarantino-style gonzo mayhem, and tossing in a bloodthirsty little girl vigilante who swears like Steve Buscemi in a Coen brothers movie, the film has its moments of high-flying, low-down style. It’s also nowhere near as subversive as it thinks it is."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,60,"Grungily stylish and often funny, at least for a while, though all of the caveats and contradictions that apply to Tarantino films apply here: One man's--or boy's--stylization is another's profane, unrelenting and tedious brutality."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,58,"Vaughn opts for comic-book bigness—big fights, big laugh lines, big explosions—but without a Spider-Man or Batman at the front of the action, Kick-Ass’s heroes and villains look smaller-than-life in a larger-than-life world."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"Never as shocking as it thinks it is, as funny as it should be, or as engaged in cultural critique as it could be, Kick-Ass is half-assed."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"An awkward blend of ultra-realistic violence, boundaries-bending satire and low comedy."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"Vaughn did a cracking good caper film with a pre-007 Daniel Craig called ""Layer Cake"" six years ago, but Kick-Ass has little of that film's heady panache and instead batters you about the face and neck with wildly over-the-top fountains of gore, bone-cracking slow-motion, and, yes, Cage, who dials his acting down a few notches from the kicky Herzogian mindf---ery of ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"Since Kick-Ass' whole premise is that comic-book violence, when enacted in real life, has real consequences, it seems a strange choice to layer Tarantino-style splatter onto the Y.A.-novel setting and play the whole thing for laughs."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,50,"The standard defense of such material is that we are watching “cartoon violence,” but, when filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick, are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer--that is, to coarsen and inflame?"
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,38,"It may well be a hit, but me, I'm waiting for  ""Iron Man 2."""
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,33,Critics who come out against Kick-Ass are leaving themselves open to that worst of contemporary accusations: a failure to be cool. But pretending that Kick-Ass is just another good-time comic book blowout is the greater failure.
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,25,"Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point? Let’s say you’re a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the move does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in."
Kick-Ass,7.6,48071303,20,"Kick-Ass - based on a graphic novel - thinks it's so brave and bold. But it's more like the title character, a dweeb who just thinks he's tough."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,90,"Though it's made with lots of modern tricks and technology, it's old-fashioned in the best sense, and not just because it's set in the Sixties."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,83,"If you have a fondness for the genre and a particular love of '60s pop, The Man From UNCLE is the summer's big fizzy drink, all bubbles, and while it may be gone the moment you walk out of the theater, the smile it puts on your face will likely linger."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,80,"It succeeds admirably on its own terms – more so, I think, than his two Sherlock Holmes films – and while it never really transcends pastiche, its ambitions don’t lie in that direction."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,80,"U.N.C.L.E. has enough style and smarts to make it an amusingly louche summer movie: a cultivated mix of action and wit, suits and cities, that feels refreshingly analogue in a digital world."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,78,"This new Man from U.N.C.L.E. would be an instant masterpiece if it were consistently as good as its best parts, but even as a hit-and-miss affair, it’s a bracing bit of late-summer fun for anyone who has given up the notion of a major studio offering anything truly revelatory until at least October."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"A celebration of a time when secret agents dressed impeccably, bantered with style, and had exceptionally cool toys. That the movie is almost instantly forgettable is part of the pleasure."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"Director Guy Ritchie, who wasn’t born when the TV show debuted in 1964, cleverly captures the elements that made it a success."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"It has taken Warner Brothers ten years to get this property a new life and, thankfully, the results in no way resemble those of its Cold War TV compatriot. Or, to put it another way, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) is good fun, which ""The Avengers"" (1998) wasn't."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"What really sets The Man From U.N.C.L.E. apart is its refusal to pander to short attention spans. This is a movie whose charm sneaks up on you, like a spy in the night."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"While The Man From U.N.C.L.E. probably isn’t any less of a caricature of its period than ""Sherlock Holmes,"" it carries its fakeness with more snap in its step. The imaginary intrigue it generates is fleeting, but often beautiful."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,75,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E. plays a like a lower key, vintage edition of a “Mission: Impossible” movie. It’s a good movie with a great look."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,70,It turns out to be absolutely delightful.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"The spectacular Italian locations, jazzy score and vehicular action finally go somewhere in the third act, when Ritchie riffs a few stylistic conventions of the era. Mesmerizing and clever, but more style than substance."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"A lot of energy and effort has gone into this endeavor, and I can't say some of it's not fun. But more of it, alas, is just tedious. Say uncle already."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"Vikander, the sexbot in ""Ex Machina,"" is having a hell of a year. And you can see why. Gaby isn't much of a part, but Vikander makes her a live wire. Her impromptu dance with Kuryakin that ends in a wrestling match is, well, something to see."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,63,"Temperamentally, Guy Ritchie aligns more with the lithe, James Bond-like Solo: detached, above-it-all, eternally cool under pressure."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"The director of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is Guy Ritchie, and there are hints, in the Berlin scenes, that he is tempted by the murkier option. Before long, however, as befits the maker of “Snatch” and “RocknRolla,” he drops the shadowy chic, decamps to Rome, and gets down to silliness."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"It almost works. Actually, it does work, hitting the requisite number of hip notes. It just doesn’t dazzle, and that’s kind of a surprise."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"Mr. Ritchie tends to flaunt his wares like a store clerk, fawning over the clothes, chairs and cars, and his usual rabbity pace slows to a tortoiselike crawl whenever the actors deliver a lot of words, which gratefully isn’t often. His talent, as he proves repeatedly, is making bodies and cars crash through space."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"It's a good-looking film and the three leads hold our attention, yet the lacklustre plotting and lack of narrative drive undercut The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s overall charm."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"Cavill and Hammer are made for each other, but the film can’t always find the pyrotechnics to match their chemistry."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"While it lacks a memorable villain, and the central pairing fizzes but never sparks, the film gets by on its vintage charm and a third act upswing."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"The film is nothing but a sensuous rush of snappy period costumes, elegant beauties, dapper men, kinetic action and so-so quips, and because Ritchie seems even less concerned with story than usual, that blinkered approach very nearly works."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,60,"Cavill and Hammer have each toplined major tentpoles before, so it’s something of a mystery why neither makes much of an impression here, but there’s a curious vacuum at the center of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. that almost certainly owes to its casting."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,58,"Stylish to a fault and straying from the source, Guy Ritchie's The Man From U.N.C.L.E. revives a 1960s television hit for the short attention spans of today's youth-skewing movie audience."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,58,"Ritchie manages a promising first act. But at the whim of the action movie formula, and ostensibly nothing else, priorities shift as the story carries forward. When we’re asked later on to attend to escalating stakes and a dimming tone, we’re simply left wondering what happened to all the fun."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"While Mission: Impossible has found a popular way to reimagine an old show for modern times, Man is immersed in all things retro — from the ginchy fashion to a jazzy score — but for an action adventure, it’s a mostly tedious affair with fleeting moments of cool."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"Ritchie is a director with no instinct for the audience, and he can’t hold things together for an entire film. He seems at a loss, from moment to moment, as to what he should emphasize."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"The period spy thriller The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is only intermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that succeed are also frustrating. Because they’re cushioned by enervated, conceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,It’s not so much bad as dull and ill-conceived. It doesn’t so much end as sputter out.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"How is that Vikander, who played the robot in the recent (and worthwhile) ""Ex Machina,"" was twice as lively and five times as human in that picture than in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?"
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,50,"It's got a few things going for it and it's not unenjoyable to sit through, but, at the same time, the tone and creative register never feel confident and settled. It's not bad but not quite good enough either."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,42,"Looks great, sounds great -- what's the problem? Everything else."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,42,"The early-’60s styles are chic, the Euro locales are swank, and the music cues (including a nod to Ennio Morricone’s Once Upon a Time in the West score) are fantastic. Too bad the plot and the lead performances are so lifeless."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,40,"Being a mildly pleasant, passingly amusing light entertainment isn't exactly saving the world, yet the film crosses its wires to blow up even that modest assignment."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,40,"There’s some nice early-60s period production design and the whole thing moves along smoothly, if unhurriedly. But it never delivers anything like the punch of Tom Cruise’s M:I adventures, nor the wit and distinctiveness of 007."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,38,"Armie Hammer has given several of the worst performances in recent years — see, or rather don’t, “Mirror Mirror” and “J. Edgar.” The big surprise in The Man from U.N.C.L.E is that Henry Cavill is even worse."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,30,"The chemistry between the leads is nonexistent. Cavill unsuccessfully tries to channel Cary Grant, while Hammer’s Kuryakin has so much inner conflict, it becomes a joke that isn’t funny."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,25,The threat that this mess of a movie might be followed by a sequel is enough to make anyone cry uncle.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,7.3,45445109,20,"It’s slow, lethargic, utterly lacking in charm and undeserving of the Cold War setting that is its best trait."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,60,It’s utterly ridiculous – and impossible to resist.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,Gods of Egypt is often sloppy and fails in many ways but the cheesy momentum is hard to resist.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"It’s all quest, flash and high action."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"It’s a spectacular mess that’s shameless in its desire to entertain through sheer, misbegotten excess."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,"A treasure trove of gilded fantasy bric-a-brac and clashing accents, Proyas’ sword-and-sandals space opera is a head above the likes of Wrath Of The Titans, but it rapidly devolves into a tedious and repetitive succession of monster chases, booby traps, and temples that start to crumble at the last minute."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,50,The alternately cornball and self-aware dialogue and the clearly not state-of-the-art CGI would seeming charmingly retro (like something from a TV miniseries two decades ago) if the movie didn't trot out one epic action film cliche after another.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,42,"While the film becomes a constant test to outdo itself, the raw ambition isn’t nearly enough to make up for the content of the actual film: an ungainly, ugly, nearly interminable monstrosity."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"It’s both thin and overstuffed, filled with intricate, at times dazzling set-pieces peopled by characters we don’t care about, and an irreverent sense of fun that nevertheless leaves us cold. It tries so hard… and ultimately achieves so little."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"If Gods of Egypt were any worse, it might be a masterpiece."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,40,"As audience-friendly as they may be, the cast is left wading through the middle ground between the unengaging narrative and over-emphasised aesthetics."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,38,"There’s a long year ahead of us, but Gods of Egypt is going to stand out as one of the sillier, more puzzling big budget, special-effects driven period pieces to come out."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,33,"Gods of Egypt is a dull, meandering, plastic mess of pre-2002 CGI and performances as flat as the green screens behind them."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,30,"This is by any measure a dreadful movie, a chintzy, CG-encrusted eyesore that oozes stupidity and self-indulgence from every pore. Yet damned if Proyas doesn’t put it all out there with a lunatic conviction you can’t help but admire."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Like the lobby of a Donald Trump building, it looks ever so expensive and amazingly cheap at the same time."

Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,Its virtues as throwback don't elide the foolhardly decision to imprint an ancient mythology on a contemporary superhero framework.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,"Gods of Egypt might have merited a so-bad-it’s-good schadenfreude fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes. Instead, it skids into dullness, thus negating the camp classic that it so often verges on becoming."
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,25,A shoddy special-effects howler that makes a hash out of both Egyptian mythology and human logic.

Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,20,"This overstuffed, witless and bloated stillborn $140 million epic is unlikely to spawn the studio's intended franchise — unless, as is so often the case, international audiences come to the box-office rescue."

Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Some movies are so effing awful they're hilarious. Gods of Egypt falls short of that lofty goal. Not because it isn’t effing awful — it so is — but because it pretends to be in on the joke.
Gods of Egypt,5.4,31153464,0,Gods of Egypt is an epic — an epic disaster.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,70,"More fun than any civilization’s fiery extinction should ever be, Paul W.S. Anderson’s Pompeii 3-D is gloriously exciting kitsch – a poor man’s ""Titanic"" crossed with an even poorer man’s ""Gladiator."""
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,70,"Part sword-and-sandal spectacle, part disaster epic, Pompeii accomplishes its ambitious agenda to largely engrossing effect."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,67,"Fortunately, Pompeii’s second half is tailor-made for Anderson’s established skill set, unfolding over a matter of hours, with many scenes set in and under a gladiatorial amphitheatre that recalls the arenas, subterranean tunnels, and cavernous vessels of Anderson’s best movies."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,63,This is a surprisingly old-fashioned disaster movie. In point of fact its old-fashioned-ness is really the only surprising thing about this eye-popping 3D spectacle.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,63,Anderson’s stab at rendering the Mount Vesuvius catastrophe with a 3-D “Titanic” gloss.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,63,"What Anderson delivers this one time is a genuine spectacle, a gladiator movie with a volcano in the middle of it."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,60,Mr. Anderson displays his mastery as a director in the sword-fighting scenes... But the glares and eye rolls that bookend these scenes are what make this film both GIF-ready and campy fun.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,60,"Anderson distinguishes himself as the rare action director who shows us real bodies in real space in real reaction to each other, who prizes legibility over quick-cut dazzlement, who stages his fights with comic-book zeal rather than puffed-up graphic-novel miserableness."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,60,"While more coherent than much of Anderson’s recent work, the film proves less successful at combining destruction and damsel-in-distress storytelling within the same frame, serving up blurry images of Milo trying to rescue Cassia while the city crumbles around them."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,58,"Most of the film is a chintzy but watchable B-movie knockoff of ""Gladiator,"" with Kit Harington, the English actor from ""Game of Thrones,"" mustering very little in the way of facial expressivity in the role of Milo."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,A wildly flawed but fitfully diverting picture.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,"No doubt the audiences in the Coliseum would offer a thumbs-up to the scale of the destruction, though even they might have had some quibbles about the special effects, which, too often, resemble a very large pile of melting crayons."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,"Pompeii is a big, glorious, cheesy mess."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,The result is a generic saga with a cast of forgettable one-dimensional characters
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,A campy guilty pleasure that serves up a “Gladiator’’ knockoff as an appetizer to the impressively flame-filled main course.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,50,"The movie is so grand in scale that you can’t help surrender to the spectacle, even if the stuff that’s going on with the people in the film is often close to risible."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Pompeii make tick all the necessary movie checkboxes, but its execution is unoriginal and uninspired."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Anderson’s Pompeii doesn’t sweat the human stuff. His camera is mostly trained on the big picture: billowing smoke, tidal-waves, fireballs streaking through the sky. What’s happening to the people on the ground doesn’t matter, so long as we’re aware that 95 percent of them are being squashed or torched."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"While it offers spectacular CGI devastation and a chiselled hero, Pompeii is so soulless and empty that you won’t shed any tears when the ‘cano blows its top."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Over-reaching and unintentionally amusing, this is straight-to-video quality inexplicably delivered at blockbuster scale. A thunderous volca-NO."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Pompeii delivers the goods – well, at least during its final 20 minutes."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,40,"Pompeii just feels like an excuse to rain digital terror on screaming extras. There’s much to see here, but little to feel, and even less to remember."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,37,"Paul W.S. Anderson, best known for the “Resident Evil” franchise and 2011’s “The Three Musketeers,” creates harrowing simulations of the disaster. It’s enough to make you want him to ditch the story altogether."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,35,"The first sixty minutes of Pompeii are awful, bordering on unwatchable... The final forty-five minutes of the movie however are, by sheer force of will, irrefutably entertaining. At least there’s raining death in the form of fireballs smashing up the place."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,30,Anderson's repeated hurling of flaming volcanic projectiles directly at the screen — the dominant feature of the latter third of Pompeii — is firmly in the lovably trashy spirit of the '50s drive-in.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,30,It fails to offer as single compelling character as a sacrifice to the angry volcano.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,30,"While Anderson excels in the film’s many moments of digital doom-and-gloom, he can’t deliver a single authentic emotion between the two star-crossed leads, leaving us with a sooty aftertaste of having sat through one very loud rendition of Titanic in togas."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,25,"It's a spectacle, all right -- but mostly just of a lot of people, some of whom should know better, making an utter ash of themselves."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,25,"If you think of Pompeii as a ride, a conveyance for special effects, and not anything resembling an emotional experience, indifference can almost be a good thing."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,25,"Shockingly, the violent release of smoke, fire, and meteoric debris is positioned more as a climactic afterthought than as the main attraction."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,20,There’s not enough villainy—nor lip-smacking comeuppance—to justify a smiting by ash or falling column. The movie in your head melts ten times better.
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,8,"When you plunk down your $12, you will get the destruction you were promised. But it's too bad it's such a repetitive, unengaging, glaringly digital experience and worse than that, you'll have to sit through the disaster that is the rest of movie."
Pompeii,5.5,23219748,0,It’s impossible to find anything that grabs you in Pompeii. This lumpen adventure with a misguided romance buries anything in the disaster-flick genre that might have been a blast.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,100,"It's a film filled with humor, charm, excitement and so many memorable images that many viewers will find themselves struggling to keep from blinking so as not to miss any of the eye-popping delights crammed into each overstuffed frame."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,80,"Valerian is a film to wallow in, not follow, and if you’re tuned to its extra-terrestrial wavelength, you wouldn’t cut a second."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,80,Valerian is at times so mind-meltingly beautiful and strange that I’m still not sure I didn’t just dream it all.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"This is a movie that will make you scream – in confusion, in delight, in anger, in ecstasy. Sometimes all at once."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,A movie for science fiction fans who wish every minute of “Star Wars” was the cantina scene.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"Are there rules on how to make a space epic? If there are, Luc Besson has certainly never heard them because in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, he takes the genre upside down, gives it a shake and rattle, and delivers one of the most positively bonkers films of the year."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,75,"The difference between the film and its equally expensive contemporaries is Luc Besson's playful, childlike naïveté."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,"As a mogul, Besson doesn’t worry about pleasing his corporate masters. He and his visual effects supervisor, Scott Stokdyk, can expend all their energy on topping themselves and making each other laugh. The movie is like a wave that makes you want to yell, “Cowabunga!”"
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets might well represent the apotheosis of Besson’s singularly loony brand of filmmaking. It’s bonkers and gorgeous and confusing and thrilling and tiring and overflowing with ideas.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,70,"“Valerian” manages to be both cutting-edge and delightfully old-school — the kind of wild, endlessly creative thrill ride that only the director of “Lucy” and “The Fifth Element” could deliver, constructed as an episodic series of missions, scrapes and near-misses featuring a mind-blowing array of environments and stunning computer-generated alien characters."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,68,"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets showcases plenty of cool creatures and ideas for sci-fi fans to savor, but if only the movie's central characters and their relationship were as exciting and interesting as all that impressive eye candy."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,"In building worlds as detailed and vivid as he’s done here, Besson has essentially allowed the setting to do what’s typically reserved for characters and stakes, and that’s to make us care."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,"The longer action scenes may not always rank with Besson’s early ’90s highlights (Léon: The Professional, La Femme Nikita) or the mania of the more recent Lucy, but there isn’t a moment in this ludicrous, lushly self-indulgent movie that doesn’t feel like its creator is having the time of his life."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,67,The first 25 minutes of this movie should be mounted as an installation at the Louvre and played on an infinite loop. Only then can our planet know peace.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"In the end, Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a mixed bag: a ripe visual adventure of limitless imagination hamstrung by an undercooked plot propelled by lackluster heroes."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"On a purely visual level, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets deserves mention among the most technically accomplished works of those three. But as a complete motion picture experience, it falls considerably short."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,63,"In short, Besson builds a dazzling alterna-universe — a bit of Terry Gilliam, a dash of “Blade Runner,” a smidgen of “Star Wars” (which, to be fair, was probably influenced by the original comic), and a lot of extra-strength Besson-ian whimsy. And then he strands us with the two least interesting people there."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a luxurious, appealingly daffy spectacle, a true vision unchecked by the standards of good taste, and that in and of itself is a quality worth savoring. But its design is pixel-deep, without the underlying thought that makes great science fiction worth revisiting."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"Besson, an industrial-strength entertainer and the reigning maximalist of the European film industry, isn’t selling originality so much as volume. He has made a madly overstuffed Mos Eisley Cantina of a movie, one that surveys its diverse alien constituencies with the wide-eyed wonderment of a small child and the attention span to boot."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"This is welcome summer fare; if we’re going to have space operas, let them sing in the strangest accents possible."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,60,"The latest from the French filmmaker is a dazzling feast of spectacular visuals and exhilarating set pieces. It’s Besson’s most ambitious film to date, and the most original big-budget adventure you’ll see on screen this season. But such ambition doesn’t always come without flaws."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,55,"Valerian isn’t a movie about plot, characters, or action; it’s a movie about places. True to its comic book roots, the larger arc exists to draw viewers into the beautiful, far-flung corners of Alpha. This makes it strangely episodic for a film, but also refreshingly light on complicated lore."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,Seldom has such a glittering wagon been hitched to such dull stars.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,Valerian has some cool visuals. But there’s more to science fiction than pretty pictures.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,It's as gorgeous as anything the French filmmaker has made and as empty as a Trump tweet.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"The story is ridiculous, the digressions many, but it’s all intended to be part of the fun. Like Besson’s ""The Fifth Element,"" we’re mainly meant to enjoy the sensation of watching wacky green-screen worlds unfold before us."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Besson's commercial instincts for sleek, violent fantasy are often sound, but ""Valerian"" is more sedative than show."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"At its best, it hits the gut with the free-fall feel of a theme-park ride. But it’s a long and winding path back to the gate, and “Valerian” loses its way many times, however beautifully."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,The result is a visually fantastic but sometimes exasperating entertainment that (once again) gets lost in its own chaos. It’s one funned-up spectacle of a movie.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Workshop the story, script-doctor the dialogue and recast the lovely leads with actors who generate a little actual sexual heat and Besson might have had another “Fifth Element,” a minor classic on his hands."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Twenty years after The Fifth Element, writer-director Luc Besson has once again delivered a widescreen, sci-fi spectacle full of rampant whimsy, lavish effects and creaky social commentary, resulting in a nervy, go-for-broke opus whose audacity is more laudable than its execution."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,50,"Even if the movie is based on an existing property, a beloved French graphic novel, as a producer and designer, Besson should be lauded; ‘Valerian’ is out of this world. But next time, he might want to reread the comic for its characters, checking the little word bubbles to see if there’s actually something there."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,48,Valerian wants to be weird and sexy but just won’t let itself.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,42,"During the film’s intoxicating first 30 minutes, for example, I couldn’t decide whether what I was watching was brilliantly bonkers or total folly. Then, as the story went on, it came into sharper and sharper focus: Valerian is an epic mess."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"There is no soul, and no heart to the story. A good sci-fi is never merely about the effects, it's about the plot, character and thoughts they bring to life, all of which Valerian lacks in abundance."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"A wildly ambitious space opera, but also a self-indulgent narrative morass. Sometimes, it seems, creativity can benefit from a few limitations."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"To say that “Valerian” is a science-fiction epic doesn’t quite do it justice. Imagine crushing a DVD of “The Phantom Menace” into a fine powder, tossing in some Adderall and Ecstasy and a pinch of cayenne pepper and snorting the resulting mixture while wearing a virtual reality helmet in a Las Vegas karaoke bar. Actually, that sounds like too much fun, but you get the idea."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets is a fantasy adventure that’s nowhere near as adventurous or fantastical as it should be.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,40,"It never stops for a minute, yet it never goes anywhere. And much as it promises to take you to a thousand planets, it can’t find one sign of intelligent life."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,38,"Sure, the pricey special effects are impressive to behold (though, as usually the case, the 3D is nothing to text home about). And yes, at times “Valerian” creates a strange and beautiful universe. Which ultimately means nothing, because the plot is paper-thin."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,37,"""Valerian” is an expensive, handsome but dozy invalid of a movie."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,Valerian displays reckless imagination and zero personality.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,"If you’re going to call your sci-fi movie Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, you’d better be sure Valerian (Dane DeHaan) is a guy your audience can get behind. Director Luc Besson styles him as a cocky space rogue, but Valerian is weak sauce. And so is this movie."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,25,There is absolutely nothing new under the many suns in Besson’s universe. This is a voyage not worth taking.
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,6.5,41189488,20,At no point along the way does the film provide a reason to invest your interest in any of this.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"It’s not about the world catching up to understand poor, lonesome Hiccup. It’s about Hiccup catching up to the expectations of the world on his own."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"Gleeful and smart, funny and serious, this sequel surpasses the endearing original with gorgeous animation — a dragon Eden, a dragon scourge, an infinitude of dragons — and one stirring human encounter after another."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"Not only does this second movie match the charm, wit, animation skill and intelligent storytelling of the original, I think it even exceeds it."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,100,"This is a sequel that has its own story to tell and that gets right down to it, and it expands on the ideas from the first film, but in a way that tells a thematically satisfying and complete story. In other words, this is how franchises are supposed to work."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,90,"If necessity is the mother of invention, then DreamWorks’ desire to extend the Dragon franchise has propelled the creative team in the most admirable of directions, resulting in what just may be the mother of all animated sequels."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"One of this year's true surprises, the superior animated sequel not only is infused with the same independent spirit and off-kilter aesthetic that enriched the original, it also deepens the first film's major themes."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"A riveting, moving and beautifully animated film."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"If anyone is concerned about the way women are presented on the big screen these days, just look at how an evolved male like Hiccup respectfully treats his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) and the portrayal of Blanchett’s Valka."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"It's thrilling, a soaring blend of 3D animation and spectacular storytelling that swerves daringly to honor the healing chaos of family, human and dragon."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,The movie offers just the right amount of spectacle.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,88,"Looks, feels and flows like a real movie. It's better than the last few Pixar features, among other things, and from where I sit that includes ""Toy Story 3."""
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,85,"Director Dean DeBlois has been saying this installment is the middle movie in a How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. It's clear that he took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy — not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,83,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is how to make a sequel, when it gets its head out of the clouds."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"At times terrifying and too tough for tinies, this is nevertheless a triumphant sequel that puts its faith in Hiccup and Toothless to find a way through dark times for man and dragon. Until we all get our own dragon to go flying with, the result is a story sufficiently thrilling to have us all airborne."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"What DeBlois has deepened in No. 2, is the film's emotional core. Though there are moments when the tension goes slack, the cast steps up to keep things afloat."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"The rote hero/villain face-offs are exciting, but the film is in no hurry to fast-forward to them. DeBlois seems to have a real passion for this world, and like Hiccup, he seems much more interested in soaring through the clouds than in fighting on the ground."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,80,"The look of the film is amazing. The animation, particularly when the dragons take flight, is seamless."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,78,"I laughed, I cried, I longed for a pet dragon to call my own."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,Visually interesting but offers nothing groundbreaking. The animation is competent but not overwhelming. There's no moment of wonderment.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"Like its 2010 predecessor, it's one of the most gorgeous computer-animated kids' films you'll come across, and one of the few that uses 3-D smartly and effectively."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,It is by far the sharpest-looking DreamWorks Animation film to date.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"Thankfully, all of the voice actors from the original return, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Craig Ferguson, and keep lightening the mood."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"Offers some stunningly beautiful sequences and an engaging, if at times quite dark, story line."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,75,"While the original movie benefited from narrative simplicity and an admirable lack of villains, this one paints the screen with too many characters and frequent diversions from the main story, but nevertheless serves up a bountiful and sugary feast for the 3-D-bespectacled eyes."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,Dragon 2 is at its best when it quiets down and dares to be intimate.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,"Dragon 2 is considerably darker and more self-aware than its forerunner. Both films are speedier than the average animated blockbuster. In places, Dragon 2 is almost too fast to keep up with, and, in other places, it’s a little too dark, at least in 3-D."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,"The plot is needlessly busy, and much of the action is more manic and indistinct. But How to Train Your Dragon 2 cuts deeper than the first picture — it will be particularly resonant for anyone who has ever worked with or adopted rescue animals — and there are a few sequences of cartoon grandeur."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,70,"Clearly, these films are the work of people who love animals. More importantly though, going beyond the pat eco-conscious message that every kids’ film has to have, HTTYD2 touches on how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can be."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,67,"There aren’t just more dragons, but more characters, more plot, more everything. The trade-off is that the charm of the original gets a little lost, a casualty of rapid-franchise expansion."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,67,"After meandering for a while, the story kicks into gear in the third act, with a couple of legitimately shocking and well-executed developments that do pack a punch missing elsewhere in the film."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,63,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 recaptures those lyrical highs. But returning writer-director Dean DeBlois also aims to layer on more poignancy for Baruchel and his castmates to play. At points, we’re left feeling a little detached."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,63,"A cartoon with better animation and livelier action, if fewer jokes. If there’s one thing these sweet-message/great flying sequence movies don’t need is fewer jokes."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,Hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"Younger kids looking for the cute connection between hesitant teen Hiccup and his loyal dragon, Toothless, may be stunned by the film’s violent tone. At the same time, it’s the unflinching edge that gives the film its unexpected depth."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"This is a more rugged affair than, say, ""Frozen,"" and any admirers of that film might find themselves yearning for a few more songs and a little less testosterone."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"If there isn't enough to feel, at least there's a lot to look at. Thanks to the superb 3-D direction by DeBlois, we swoop through the air, whoosh down dragons’ tails, and juuust baaaarely squeeze into small crevices, but still, those experiences are only like being on a really great rollercoaster — they don't mean anything."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,60,"The action sequences here are armrest-gripping fun, and you only wish DeBlois and his animators had been even more confident; held their shots even longer; allowed us to enjoy the whistle of the wind and the curve of the dragons’ flight paths without hurriedly cutting away to another angle, and another, and another. When the film flies, it soars."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,50,"It has the core of a genuine crowd-pleaser, but unfortunately something bigger and more all-consuming keeps getting into its head."
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7.8,177002924,50,What's unfortunate is that Toothless is starring in a toothless story.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,The World’s End isn’t perfect – – but its best moments leave the bulk of recent American “event movies” gasping in the dust.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,"The World’s End not only makes a more than worthy conclusion to the Cornetto trilogy — it stands on its own as one of the sharpest, saddest and wisest comedies of the year."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,"What ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" did for zombie and cop flicks The World's End does for sci-fi fatalism, respecting its doomsday tropes while presenting them with cheeky wit and a refreshing strategy of sensory underload."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,"The beauty of this movie, both a nostalgic romp and a futuristic scream, is its stubborn insistence on getting all the trapped-in-amber details right."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,This is by light-years the most entertaining movie of the year. How many apocalyptic sci-fi action extravaganzas leave you feeling as if the world is just beginning?
The World's End,7.0,26004851,100,An ordinary drama embellished and in some sense infringed on by genre elements rather than the other way around.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,91,"Easily one of the year’s best comedies, the movie thrives off the chemistry between its leads, with Pegg painting a very funny portrait of emotional paralysis and Frost demonstrating a heretofore unseen talent for intimidation."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,90,"Indeed, while the action-packed final act of The World’s End gets pretty formulaic (as it channels everything from “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” to “The Stepford Wives”), there’s ALMOST something serious at the core of this riotous comedy."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,90,"As in all of Wright’s films, the surface is just as satisfying as the subtext: hilarious comedy, compelling character drama, eye-popping visuals, and a juicy science-fiction story."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,"Wright is a brilliant director of turbocharged exposition, elegant but bruising action sequences, and graphically bold comedic overkill."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,It'll knock you on you ass from laughing when you're not rubbing your eyes in disbelief.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,"The cast is amazing, from the great duo of Frost and Pegg to the supporting players, many of whom are better known for taking on heavy dramatic fare. The editing, special effects and set design — a joy to experience."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,88,"The movie is madly, wonderfully at odds with itself."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,87,"A knowing take on movies and maturity alike, The World’s End is just as thoroughly thoughtful as those which came before it, and maybe more than ever, you’ll find yourself laughing to keep from crying."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,83,"As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"There is something weird about the twins, something that will fuel a bar room brawl until it goes quite literally global, that will let director Wright take a leap into another genre entirely and that will allow The World's End to spin into ever grander comic mayhem, even as it becomes a surprisingly effecting look at the folly of trying to recapture one's youth."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The buzz of The World’s End is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor. There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end — no “Hangover,” in other words. I’ll drink to that."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,The World's End stands on its own as hilarious high-end nonsense.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"Some inner logic may not hold up under the sober light of day, but this unusual action-comedy has the loosey-goosey feel of something that can’t miss, like a soused round of bar pool. The final triumph: In a summer full of capes and masks, beer-bellied Frost tears off his shirt à la the Hulk. It’s this season’s best superhero moment."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"Audacious and witty, The World's End is a strange brew."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"A mix of comedy, science fiction, nostalgia, adolescent wish-fulfillment and beer, beer, beer, its parts shouldn’t fit together as neatly as they do. But somehow Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have again managed to make a movie that is knowing, touching and hilarious."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The World's End is a big, shaggy dog of a thing, a free-spirited ramble held together by off-kilter asides, clever-dumb puns, and seemingly random bits of dialogue that could almost become catchphrases in spite of themselves."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The armageddon-through-beer-goggles approach brings the chuckles, but The World’s End stands up as a great example of the genre it ribs. Nostalgic, bittersweet and very, very funny."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"The World’s End is a fitting end to the trilogy: it is by turns trashy, poignant and gut-bustingly funny, and often all three at once."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"While things get a tad buckled town in mayhem and special effects throughout the film’s busy final reels, Wright spends enough time sketching out his mischievous middle-aged men so that their journey...feels worthwhile and even meaningful for a few of them."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"Bravely refusing to rigidly adhere to a formula that has been so successful, Wright, Pegg and Frost’s Cornetto Trilogy closer has tonal shifts you won’t expect, but the same beating heart you’ve been craving."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,80,"This is a tighter, smarter film than either Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, and buried beneath all the blue-goo aliens and terrible punning is a heartfelt meditation on the perils and pleasures of nostalgia."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,78,The World’s End affectionately takes a page from our Fifties sci-fi films.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"There's a lot of fun to be had in watching The World's End and, surprisingly, more thematic depth than one might expect. The humor, true to its British roots, may baffle some Americans but those who ""get"" it will laugh quite a bit."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,This movie’s pleasures are less about its villains and more about the interplay between Pegg and Frost.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"When the movie is funny, it’s very funny."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Until the sci-fi switcheroo, the versatile supporting cast puts Gary in such a ridiculous light that we can’t help laughing at him. Then suddenly this subversive movie challenges us to laugh at our own assumptions."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"The result is an original picture, not entirely successful, but successful enough, and delightful in its ability to surprise viewers, and juggle tones and keep every ball in the air. The World's End has the aura - and this might only be an attractive illusion - of something imagined whole, in a burst of inspiration, rather than as something labored over."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Smart, funny, and gross (often at the same time)."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"The World’s End builds to an unexpectedly witty, funny climax that flies in the face of most films of its genre, and although its humor is not for all tastes, no one can say this crazy picture doesn’t have the guts to live up to its title."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Despite a too-long third act, dragging action sequences and an epilogue that would have been better left on the cutting room floor, the wordy wit and ingenuity of The World’s End is a sloppy triumph over this summer’s other alien/robot hybrid flick, ""Pacific Rim."""
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,This is a movie that floats by on dazzlingly silly banter and well-slung slang.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,75,"Despite its shortcomings, The World's End glistens with a comedic energy not present in equivalent mainstream blockbusters."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,70,A fraction less gut-bustingly goofy than its predecessors.
The World's End,7.0,26004851,70,"The World’s End is more frantic than funny, but it’s still funny enough — just — to outweigh its own silliness."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,63,"The premise of visiting so many pubs as a narrative device, however, bogs down the initially energetic pacing and goofiness. Piling on the mayhem renders The World's End a sometimes chaotic and uneven comedy."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,63,"Also helping to sell it all is the fact that these films, goofy though they may be, feature a consistently high level of acting. In addition to Pegg, we get Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit""), Paddy Considine (""Red Riding""), Eddie Marsan (""Sherlock Holmes"") and Bill Nighy (""Love Actually""), all of whom have appeared previously in the trilogy."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,60,"As a film whose central theme emphasizes the dangers of living in the past, Wright, Pegg and Frost become fatally distracted by nostalgia, eventually paying too much homage to previous classics—especially their own—to create another film that deserves to stand alongside them."
The World's End,7.0,26004851,58,"The movie independently bungles everything it tries, like a Central Park busker who simultaneously sucks at juggling, harmonica playing and skateboarding."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,100,The good humor bubbles up from a deep reservoir of affection for Hollywood schlock.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,100,"The best, surely the smartest, English-language movie of the year to date."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,Everything an action-comedy should be. It achieves through parody what most films in the genre can't accomplish straight.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,"In addition to the marvelous lead cast, all sorts of funny performers show up in cameo roles, including Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Dalton."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,91,"It's not hard to imagine these characters in a straight-faced Hollywood blockbuster. And that's the source of Hot Fuzz's genius, pointing out the thin line that separates convention from farce when Hollywood starts throwing its special effects around."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"For most of its running time, it's an enjoyably unpretentious celebration of the guilty pleasure we can take from a stupid-as-all-get-out car chase or from watching things blow up real good. Then, in its final half hour, Wright and Pegg ratchet up the absurdity tenfold and enter the realm of the sublime."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"Wright and Pegg are storytellers who weave their naughty bits into genuine characters and a plot. It's a ridiculous plot, but one that's absolutely in the spirit of the films they're satirizing."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,90,"Summer hasn't arrived, but the funniest riff on a summer movie genre has already landed."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,88,"If you see Hot Fuzz, you'll never again watch a Michael Bay film without howling with disrespectful laughter."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,88,It's as laceratingly entertaining as its predecessor.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,88,"Pegg and Wright are armed with an endlessly impressive arsenal of attention grabbers, from witty editing tricks to a wry soundtrack and a joke-packed script that demands multiple viewings."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"In the very funny cop comedy Hot Fuzz, overachieving London police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) commits a very British sin: He's too good."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"Hot Fuzz is something all too rare in movie comedies: a story rather than a string of disjointed skits, with hearty characters behind its caricatures."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,83,"It's smashing fun, nonetheless, made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,A sustained genre parody that's equally funny but (maybe in deference to the genre) much more pumped up.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"A British variation on Hollywood nonsense, and as such it's a little gloomier, a little coarser, and a lot more cerebral--oh, and funnier than all the ""Reno 911!"" boxed sets combined."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"Since Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg are essentially parodying self-parodies, they have also smartly kinked up their conceit by setting most of the film in a sleepy village that might as well be called Ye Old English Towne, thereby wedding one of the most irritating British exports to one of the most absurd American ones. Think of it as ""The Full Monty"" blown to smithereens."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,The boys (now in blue) have done it again.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,At once deeply affectionate and sharply observed: There's never anything smart-alecky about Wright's approach as a director.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"The whole enterprise goes far beyond pastiche, wreathing its characters in a film-intoxicated world."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"Really, do we need another dumb action movie to remind us how dumb action movies are?...Yes. We absolutely do."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,80,"The thrill of Hot Fuzz is the chemistry between Nicholas and local oaf Danny Butterman, who is an action film aficionado and finds Nicholas' stories utterly engrossing."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,78,The most originally funny movie to hit U.S. screens in a while.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"A little too long and suffers from a sagging midsection when the level of exposition becomes laborious, but the spectacularly entertaining final 30 minutes compensates for a lot of flaws."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,It's a blast.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"The best of it is a riot--a ""Bad Boys II"" fireball hurled with exquisite accuracy at a quaint English town peopled by Agatha Christie archetypes."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"With Hot Fuzz, you'll just have to settle for semi-hilarity."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"A real actioner, generous with the bullets and blood and chase scenes, that simultaneously mocks shoot-'em-ups."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"Plays like two films in one, and succeeds on both levels."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"It's to the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,"It's bloody carnage - or it's ketchup, or bolognese sauce, at the very least."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,75,Deeply nuts and exhaustingly hilarious.
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,70,"Hot Fuzz deploys the same mix of genre conventions, slapstick and old-school British humor that made ""Shaun of the Dead"" such a dumb-but-good romp."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,70,"Hot Fuzz is fun, and it's nice to see all the English character actors who aren't busy in Harry Potter films, but it lacks its predecessor's freshness."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,63,"Basically a one-joke movie, and they take their sweet time -- too much of it, actually -- getting to the good stuff. But what excellent laughs they provide in the end."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,63,"Though it's no ""Monty Python,"" Hot Fuzz is a clever, over-the-top marriage of mayhem and merriment."
Hot Fuzz,7.9,23637265,60,"All the action is staged with energy, but it gets relentless without anything really funny going on."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,80,"The Legend of Tarzan has a whole lot of fun, big-screen things going for it — adventure, romance, natural landscapes, digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome man-muscle. Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its old-fashioned escapades — it’s one long dash through the jungle by foot, train, boat and swinging vine — but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,80,"The Legend of Tarzan isn't half-bad; actually, it's pretty good. Beautifully made and smartly set at the beginning of Belgian King Leopold II's rapacious colonization of the Congo in the 1880s, this is certainly the best live-action Tarzan film in many a decade (which, admittedly, isn't saying much) and offers a well-judged balance of vigorous action and engaging-enough drama."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"Director David Yates, who did the last four “Harry Potter” films, delivers both big thrills at the climax and small, spooky ones when Tarzan and the others move through a world of beauty, terror and mystery."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"Unlike so many of the bloated, disappointing entries into the 2016 big budget sweepstakes, this is good escapist entertainment."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,75,"You have to admire the sheer physical scope of this epic, even if there are no animals in it."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,68,"Waltz is the perfect villain in this setting: He's played this exact role before, as the smug, drawling, creepy aesthete who rarely stops smiling. But he's also capable of pivoting on a dime between real menace and garish, performative evil, between playing a subdued charmer, and the kind of movie-serial baddie who ties women to railroad tracks."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"As much as I enjoyed this bizarre, ambitious adventure and its careful popcorn kitsch, Tarzan’s story will always leave our ears ringing with something we hate, whether you choose Burroughs’s white-savior syndrome or Christoph Waltz’s shivery final speech: “The future belongs to me.”"
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"As it turns out, The Legend of Tarzan isn’t half-bad, and the film deftly put most of my fears to rest by creating animals and jungles that serve and enhance the story rather than detracting from it."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,67,"You just wish — after two solid but oddly joyless hours — that Legend strained less to hit its marks, and swung a little more."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,63,"It's a heavy thematic load for a single movie to handle — especially this one, which nearly collapses from its burden. But it's hard to fault director David Yates, who captained the last four Harry Potter movies, for having ambition."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,63,"There’s always been something a bit ridiculous about the whole Tarzan premise, and while the talented cast and a solid director make for a serviceable and intermittently entertaining adventure, there’s very little about this film that screams, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,60,"The fights are quick and brutal and bloodless, with too much slo-mo and sped-up stuff, and some clever camera angles that get cut from before you can work out what you're looking at."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,60,"Skarsgård himself is fairly bland as Greystoke, delivering a po-faced Byronic spin on the character, all velvet coats and dreamy romantic stares at his belle while sitting barefooted in the boughs of trees. But at least the animals are memorable – best of all is a pack of scene-stopping silverback gorillas digitally created for the movie. This Tarzan isn’t quite the jungle VIP – but it’s got a little swing."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,58,It’s nice that The Legend Of Tarzan isn’t a nakedly mercenary franchise play that presumes dozens of sequels to come. (It’s also not a low-rent Casper Van Dien vehicle.) But it sure could use some money-grubbing set pieces to tie the genial silliness together.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The set pieces are fun, if not as spectacular as those in Jon Favreau's adaptation of Kipling's similar ""The Jungle Book."" And the plot moves at a nice pace."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"There’s also not much chemistry between Skarsgard and Robbie in a film that hints at the Greystokes’ great sex life but barely shows it. Instead, we get flashes of flesh that are hilariously dated in their obviousness."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"Its theme of white man as savior of black Africans is, to say the least, highly anachronistic in these days and times."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"While it looks great with its gorgeous computer-generated foliage and realistic animals, the story focuses too much on its stiff hero and a one-note villain rather than the big-picture ideas it raises in passing."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The Legend of Tarzan isn’t as singularly joyless as many of this summer’s other current offerings, but it also feels distinctly like a missed opportunity. Even when Skarsgård offers up the character’s famous jungle cry, it sounds more mournful than enthusiastic, and that sentiment seeps into the entire enterprise."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"For what it's worth, The Legend of Tarzan is several unpretentious cuts above the pompous, leaden ""Greystoke"" of over thirty years ago."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,50,"The result is a “Legend” that feels inoffensively modern, or at least less offensive than it could have been...But you can’t make a bold statement or exciting action picture when every frame is filled with fear — of offending someone, of upsetting animal rights activists, of giving the audience a Tarzan they won’t recognize, of failure."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,42,"Tarzan is too dull to offer consistent pulp excitement, too self-serious to let itself have fun, and too reliant on same-y CG spectacle to truly thrill."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,42,"Filmmakers simply can't make Tarzan like they used to. If someone tries, like director David Yates did with The Legend of Tarzan, he's just another superhero, swinging on vines rather than spider webs. Natives can't be restless. Lions won't be wrestled...Tarzan fans leave feeling Cheetah'd."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,Robbie lights up her scenes with the much more special effect of raw personality.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"The new Tarzan film, The Legend of Tarzan, plays as if a dog ate part of the script."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"As written by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, The Legend of Tarzan alternates between a brazenly contemporary sensibility and quietly time-honored events. Unfortunately, almost all of the former are awkward while the latter still ring true."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"""Unfun"" isn't a real word, but boy, it sure describes The Legend of Tarzan."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"Not so much a ripping yarn, more of a dripping yarn, Yates’ reinterpretation of the Lord Of The Jungle is a big disappointment."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"Alexander Skarsgard is more abs than actor as the ape man, and Margot Robbie's Jane looks about as 19th-Century as an Aussie surfer girl. Together, they produce all the real-life passion of an Abercrombie & Fitch ad."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"The Legend of Tarzan ends up being a garbled, clunky production that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,40,"As a brand, Burroughs’ hero has always been schlocky, and no amount of psychological depth or physical perfection can render him otherwise if the filmmakers can’t swing a convincing interaction between Tarzan and his animal allies. That dynamic — along with his full-throated yodel — has always been Tarzan’s trademark, but in this relatively lifeless incarnation, it simply doesn’t register."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,38,The film's action sequences are a jumble of movement and cuts that have no discernible relation to the actual motion of the characters.
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,38,"It all might wash in a Johnny Weissmuller “Tarzan” movie from the 1940s. It no longer suffices today. Filmmakers, it’s time to pack up Greystoke Manor. Tarzan is dead."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,33,"I can respect the intent to craft The Legend of Tarzan as a new chapter for the hero, one which is aware of all the shortcomings of many Tarzan stories that have gone before. And yet the film minimizes its own best ideas and falls back on adventure film tropes, old and new, in a way that undermines its attempt to decontextualize Burroughs’ aging swinger."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,33,"Don’t be fooled by the lack of spandex: The Legend of Tarzan turns the Lord of the Apes into just another superhero, the newest movie about fiction’s greatest wild man memorable only for the dull irony of how housebroken it feels."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,30,"The Legend of Tarzan is too boring to be truly offensive. In spite of some impressive hand and brow acting, Skarsgard’s Tarzan is a frustrating blank and Margot Robbie’s Jane is a simple damsel in distress."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"Tarzan does little to adapt to modern times. Perhaps most punishingly of all for Skarsgard’s “True Blood” fans, it fails to ever put our hero in a skimpy loincloth."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"The Legend of Tarzan doles out big beats of action at regular intervals to keep you awake, like a drunkard clashing trashcan lids in an alley late at night. But your eyelids grow heavy anyway."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,25,"In the end, what we have here is a Tarzan movie made by people who don’t understand the appeal of Tarzan. He’s about joy and abandon and the fantasy of living in harmony with creation. He’s not about the struggle in the Congo."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,20,"This ungainly and glum tale of the man famously known as Tarzan — who returns to the Congo, reconnecting with his past in the process — slavishly adheres to contemporary blockbuster convention, offering not a single spark of inspiration or real daring. A talented cast led by Alexander Skarsgård scowls through the film, held hostage by a solemn script and ghastly amounts of CG."
The Legend of Tarzan,6.3,126643061,10,"The Legend of Tarzan, for all its anticolonialist posturing and eminently attractive co-stars, has a dead soul."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,70,"Squeamish types may balk, but the gory cruelty on display here is faithful to the source material and deeply thrilling."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,63,"It has a certain commitment to its cause, and by that I mean it supplies the necessary flayings, slayings, beheadings and, um, a be-nose-ing, all of it dancing to the tune of those amusingly stilted He-Man declaratives - King James Bible cadences applied to comic-book visions. It knows it's a B movie, and gets on with it."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,60,"Brutal, bloody beyond belief, and has no socially redeeming value. So it is with a certain amount of guilt that I say it's kind of a wicked blast to watch, especially if you're in the mood for some righteous revenge."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,60,"The film's secret weapon proves to be Freddy Krueger–fingernailed witch Marique, whom Rose McGowan plays with the kind of fuck-it-all brio - imagine a cross between Madeline Kahn in ""History of the World: Part I"" and Lady Gaga - that should garner her a Razzie and an Oscar."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Conan the Barbarian has its small, insipid pleasures, if you're in the mood."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Mr. Momoa has some awfully big biceps to fill. He rises to that task with a pumped physique made for ogling. Thankfully, he also shows glints of self-awareness that can make hypermasculine blowouts like these more watchable and were largely missing from Mr. Schwarzenegger's wide-eyed turn in the first ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982)."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Rife with the oldest and simplest pleasures of 3-D movies: all sorts of objects fly at the camera, and the climactic battle takes place over a deep, dark chasm. At its best the movie suggests a funhouse at a state-of-the-art county fair; at its worst it's a fairly dumb celebration of brute violence."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"It's mostly noise and splurch and, as I mentioned, aaaaarrrrggggghhhhh!"
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,There's something and nothing for everyone in Conan the Barbarian 3D.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"Take away much of the myth, most of the sorcery and all of the humor of the 1982 John Milius-Arnold Schwarzenegger version of the sword and sorcery epic ""Conan the Barbarian"" and you've got an idea what the new  ""Conan"" is like."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,50,"The well-executed picture solves the biggest challenge facing those hoping to breathe new life -- however nasty, brutish and short -- into the 79-year-old franchise by finding an actor capable of filling Ah-nuld's shoes."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,45,"The movie's look is artificially grainy, and most of the scenes are encrusted with CGI - you'd have to chip it away with a chisel to get to anything human or interesting or even remotely fantastical."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,40,A gaudily ornamented medieval banquet table groaning with junk food and open entrails.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,40,The bigger problem is that the action literally bleeds together and there's no sense of pacing.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"The 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian looks cheap and feels rushed. The few good elements are dwarfed by a generic, nonsensical plot and shoddy storytelling."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"In today's cultural climate, any remake of Conan the Barbarian can only be considered (a) redundant or (b) a cruel case of rubbing salt in our cinematic wounds. Either way, it ain't a pretty sight – in fact, it's downright barbaric."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"Those nostrils do a lot of Momoa's acting, to be honest. As right as he is looks-wise, Momoa falls short in attitude."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"Conan the Barbarian lives by a pretty simple ethos: He lives, he loves, he slays. What he doesn't do, alas, is act."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"As for the movie itself, it's tolerable."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,38,"A brutal, crude, witless high-tech CGI contrivance, in which no artificial technique has been overlooked, including 3-D."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,30,"The result is a somewhat functional blood feast for the exploitation crowd, but it's hardly a bead of sweat on the original's battered backside. Oh, and the score? Basil Poledouris' bombastic brass is still No. 1."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,30,"There's just not a lot to like here, with the exception of what may be one of the all-time best bad movie lines, one Conan utters to Tamara as a kind of personal credo: ""I live. I love. I slay. I am content."""
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,30,"There is no purpose to the film other than random blood splattering amid scenes of bondage, primitive savagery and S&M eroticism. The film is numbing and dumb with its hero indistinguishable from its villains."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"Morgan Freeman's voice is heard as the narrator, which is in itself the stuff of parody. Then we listen and get lost within two sentences, because the narration is so poorly written that Freeman himself probably didn't know what he was talking about."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"Momoa, a familiar face from ""Game of Thrones"" to ""Baywatch,"" has the muscles but not the imposing persona and barbaric presence that Conan requires."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"It shouldn't, in other words, be that hard to make a good Conan movie. John Milius did a half-decent job with ""Conan The Barbarian"" in 1982, but this new film of the same name feels like a half-hearted revamp of virtually any of the Conan rip-offs that clogged up video-store shelves in the '80s."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,25,"The re-whatevered Conan the Barbarian feels unexpectedly low-rent, even with its multi-million-dollar backdrops and ear-splitting, rumbling soundtrack and (presumably post-converted) 3D imagery."
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,20,With the most growling and grunting of any movie this summer - and that includes those apes perched atop the box office - Conan the Barbarian seems at times to have actually been made by barbarians.
Conan the Barbarian,5.2,21295021,20,"There are swords and sorcery, pirates and monsters, taxed bodices and taxing mythology. In other words, there's the bare minimum necessary to summon this dismal movie into existence."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,89,This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it's done.
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,80,"A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,75,"It's great fun, but certainly not great art."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,75,"Imagine two movies...The first is a moody thriller about two brothers who pull off a bank job, take a family hostage, and head for Mexico. The second is a garish horror freak-out. The deranged hook of From Dusk Till Dawn is that it starts out as the first movie and turns, on a dime, into the second."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,70,"Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates his talents more clearly than ever -- he's visually inventive, quick-witted and a fabulous editor -- while still hampering himself with sophomoric material."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,70,"The movie's horror-comics second half is cheesy, derivative, and ultimately a little wearying. But it's also unpretentious and insanely cheerful."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,60,"Robert Rodriguez's second effort is a funny, craftily written piece of low-grade horror crapola."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,60,"On a mindless exploitation level this is pretty good, but on other levels it seems to make promises that it fails to deliver on; none of the deaths carries any moral weight, and the climactic special-effects free-for-all tends to drown out all other interests."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,60,Rodriguez's film is a high-octane fun-house ride with only one speed: sick-making.
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,50,"Spiritually it's a John Woo-George Romero-Jim Thompson picture, outrageously bloody and weird."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,50,"Plenty of surprises, almost all of them nasty."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,40,"George Clooney is the best reason to submit yourself to From Dusk Till Dawn, an exceedingly grotesque thriller-horror-comedy that fails to live up to the promise of its opening reels."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,10,It's a triumph of vile over content; mindless nihilism posing as hipness.
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,10,"A plodding, aggressive film that is neither engaging, disturbing nor funny."
From Dusk Till Dawn,7.2,25753840,0,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez had their fun with From Dusk Till Dawn, and now they need to stay away from each other. For their own good. Forever."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,90,"The summer’s best, coolest, juiciest, smartest action movie."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,90,"It's gleefully bold, visually adventurous, often funny, strikingly concise — the whole heart-pounding tale is over in 90 minutes — and 100% entertaining."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,83,"It comes across, instead, as a directorial flight of fancy, an imaginatively goofy take on an already goofy idea, exaggerated by Besson’s blunt style and an uncommonly fast pace."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,83,"It's basically the perfect summer movie, because it's designed to be."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"This undeniably silly, but raucously entertaining, off-the-wall transhumanist actioner is an absolute riot."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"Besson is at his balls-out bonkers best in this genre-scrambling, mind-expanding exhilarator."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,It’s the blockbuster of the summer.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,80,"Lucy is insane, makes very little sense, doesn't stand up to scrutiny and is an absolute blast."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,78,"The best comic-book movie in a long time, though based on no comic, Lucy is a film that mates classic Besson with Quentin Tarantino in a go at the mystical, world-solving vision found in Stanley Kubrick’s ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Terrence Malick’s ""The Tree of Life."""
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"What Johansson does in Lucy won't win her any prizes, but it establishes her ability to carry a movie that has some ideas, however half-baked, and has nothing to do with her obvious sex appeal."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"When it comes to sheer comic-book fun, few summer movies deliver a more consistent, satisfying, thoroughly enjoyable shot of cinematic jouissance than the delightfully adventurous actress Scarlett Johansson's latest bit of strange, Lucy."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Like many films by Besson — ""The Professional,"" ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Messenger"" and other high-octane shoot-'em-ups — Lucy starts out riveting but becomes less engaging as it goes along."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,Lucy is what a superhero movie might look like if developed by Spike Jonze and/or Michael Gondry.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Scarlett Johansson is ideally cast as a rapidly evolving kick-ass hero in Lucy, a stylish action thriller that is equal parts dazzling and ludicrous."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"It’s all ridiculous and enjoyable, and at the movie’s center is an actress creatively guessing at what omniscience might feel like."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"A full-out action movie - and a sober rumination on the nature of existence. It is both things, effectively and sincerely."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"In a captivating climax, the movie turns attractively freaky, though somewhat marred by cheesy special effects, and there’s a huge debt to the immense leaps of “2001.” An abrupt ending feels frustrating and leaves questions floating in space. Then again, I’m using only 3 to 5 percent of my capacity, so what do I know?"
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"By the time the film exhausts itself—in a brisk 89 minutes — it feels like there's literally nowhere that Lucy and Besson can't go, no boundaries, no laws, no logic. Just go with it."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,75,"Vulgar auteurist Luc Besson finally commits wholeheartedly to his decades-long preoccupation with waifish young women discovering their inner Shiva, spinning the concept out to its most delirious possible extremes."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,An outlandishly entertaining mixture of high silliness and high style.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"There are a number of terrific production numbers in Lucy, basically violent action scenes that border on slapstick, and as long as we agree in advance that the “science” in this movie goes beyond pseudo into total B.S., I believe you will leave satisfied."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"Buoyed by Ms. Johansson’s presence, Mr. Besson keeps his entertainment machine purring. He may be a hack, but he’s also a reliable entertainer."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,70,"Giddily recycling everything from “2001: A Space Odyssey” and “The Matrix” to yakuza actioners and National Geographic documentaries, it’s a garish, trippy, wildly uneven and finally quite disarming piece of work, graced by a moment-to-moment unpredictability."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,67,"Lucy doesn't hold together, but with its flashy innovation, Besson's trying to freshen the formula. It's the kind of freewheeling mess of a movie you wish studios would try out more often."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Lucy, you may have twigged, is named after our 3.2-million-year-old hominid ancestor."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Although Besson, the director of “La Femme Nikita” and the producer of “Taken,” indulges in some operatic violence, the film is more spacey than pacey."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,63,"Besson’s script may let her (and Freeman) down in the third act, but the 89 minute long Lucy is so brisk it’ll give you whiplash. Even marginal thrillers benefit from a director and star who have a sense of urgency and are as hellbent as this on not overstaying their welcome."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"This ridiculous, highly watchable, at points startlingly psychedelic action thriller is probably Luc Besson’s best film since ‘Léon’ (which isn’t saying a great deal)."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,What begins as a thrilling pastiche of comic-book formula gets bogged down in its own scientific prattle — not that you ever stop adoring Johansson’s magnificent heroine.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"Lucy earns points for its unpredictable treatment of its vaguely superhero-ish premise and an appealing silliness, but it struggles to match wits with the genius at its center."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,60,"The end of the movie goes completely off the rails, but in a way that is charming in its stupidity."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,58,Whether you take to it will depend on whether you consider “high-octane” or “nonsense” the more important word.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,58,"There are moments of real wonder and even beauty amidst the slam and the bang and the big bada boom, and while Lucy is a mixed bag, it's been mixed by a master, and it is delightfully, happily insane."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,52,"Even Besson’s most bold choices – and this is a film that goes weird, and then just keeps getting weirder – don’t seem so revolutionary when packaged in such well-tread trappings and increasingly shoddy writing."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"I know we’re supposed to think that Besson’s daffy cinematic calisthenics are entertaining because at least they are not boring. But I was bored. It didn’t help that Morgan Freeman shows up as a brainy scientist explaining everything to us in his deepest intonations. When was the last time Freeman, a great actor, really acted?"
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"An entertainment choice I wouldn’t recommend, but one you might not regret if you dial your expectations down (or your drug intake up)."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"When everything and anything is possible, nothing feels urgent or truly dramatic. The movie devolves into a melange of digital effects and sequences of glamorous slaughter, as Lucy swaggers around, with that big brain, and slouches toward becoming a full-lipped deity."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,The junk in Lucy doesn't entirely eclipse the moments when weird is fun.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"Remember ""Limitless,"" the 2011 thriller in which Bradley Cooper becomes a whirling killer dervish from a drug that lets him access 100 percent of his brain? Well, Lucy is basically the same movie with Scarlett Johansson in the Cooper role. It's not a good trade-off."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,50,"Lucy is a confounding experience, but at a brisk 85 or so minutes, it manages not to outstay its welcome. Those not enamored of Besson's particular brand of Euro-schlock grindhouse existentialism, however, may find their brains more stimulated elsewhere."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,"A brazenly mindless thriller about the infinite capacities of the human brain.
That said, sometimes we just want to shut down and give in to bombastic summer entertainment. In that regard, as usual, Besson delivers."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,"There's enough mumbo jumbo about space and time and cellular division to allow Lucy to feign depth, but what lingers is Besson's regressive belief that even the most intelligent woman on earth can't figure out how to get her way without a miniskirt and a gun."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,40,Lucy plays more like a big dumb superhero flick than sci-fi.
Lucy,6.4,126663600,20,"The funny thing about all these sub-""Matrix"" shenanigans is that they’re genuinely meant to stoke thought and reflection. Frankly, though, few movies have left me feeling as shorn of gray matter."
Lucy,6.4,126663600,12,"Besson has always demonstrated the ability to chuckle at the madness of his own material, and he provides some solid laughs from time to time. But these winks do nothing to erase the reality of a plot that becomes unintentionally hilarious."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,100,"The Equalizer is gripping, mysterious and even sometimes moving, but it’s never pleasant, still less fun. If you decide to go, don’t claim you weren’t warned. If you skip it, you’re missing one of the year’s signal works of superior Hollywood craftsmanship."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,88,"The Equalizer features some gruesomely creative violence, but it’s equally memorable for the small, gritty moments set in that diner, or on the rough-and-tumble streets of Boston. And most of all, it’s got Denzel going for it."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,80,"If The Equalizer is the hit it should be, it will give this veteran action star his very first movie franchise. In the sequel, Denzel-McCall could make things right in Ukraine as Obama’s Secretary of Defense and one-man army."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,80,"Ramping up his style to a more dynamic and elegant level than he’s achieved previously, Fuqua socks over the suspense and action but also takes the time for some quiet, even spare moments to emphasize the hero’s calm and apartness."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,80,"Willfully empty but wildly entertaining, The Equalizer stands out from its peers like a wolf among lapdogs, as Fuqua and Washington bring out the best in each other for the benefit of the audience."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"Director Anton Fuqua has jettisoned almost everything related to the TV series except the title, the main character's name, and the bare-bones premise. Even the theme song is gone. For all intents and purposes, The Equalizer isn't so much a reboot as it is an entirely new entity."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,It's easy to see why neither Home Depot nor Lowe's chose to go the product placement route. Too many cleanups in the power tool department.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"The Equalizer, which reteams Washington with his Training Day director, Fuqua, is an origin story, like the birth of Batman, or Daredevil. If audiences and star are so inclined, it's easy to see this premise and this character - a tough, taciturn gent burdened with regret and a very special skill set - going into Roman numerals."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"There’s nothing hugely original about the script by Richard Wenk (who cowrote “Expendables 2” with Sylvester Stallone), but Washington is a master at putting his own inimitable and stylish spin on even the most familiar situations."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"While some might decry the ludicrous showdown that unfolds in the darkened aisles of McCall’s mega-store workplace, I got a kick out of watching Washington turn everyday hardware supplies into lethal weaponry."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,"The Equalizer is silly but irresistible, taking situations of inherent gut-level impact and exploiting them for every bit of emotion and tension. It could never have been a great movie."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,75,Denzel Washington doesn’t demonstrate how great he is with first-rate scripts such as “Flight.” He does it by elevating sophisticated pulp like The Equalizer to a higher level.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,70,A tense thriller that also has more on its mind than the familiar genre constraints it operates under.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,70,"Truly, you don't have to watch former secret agents relentlessly wipe out villains. But if you want to, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone better than Washington for the task."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,67,"This is a kid’s fantasy of how to be bigger and badder than anybody else. As for Washington, no doubt he now has his very own franchise."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,67,"Washington is always superb when playing characters with a surface calm, but a boiling-over interior. Here, as the protagonist, he steers a vivid course through a seamy world."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"Bring on the sequel please, because, as fine as Denzel is, director Antoine Fuqua’s The Equalizer is not so good – a self-consciously stylized, stop-and-start hodgepodge of Death Wish street vengeance, Bond-style Russian villainy, and moodily shot Boston locale."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"The material shows its age when McCall goes all ""Taxi Driver"" to save a teen hooker (a scrappy Chloë Grace Moretz) from her pimps. But Washington and director Antoine Fuqua, who teamed for the actor's Oscar-winning role in 2001's ""Training Day,"" keep the action humming."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"The Equalizer, loosely based on the TV series of the late ’80s, is a guilty-pleasure platform for Washington’s slow-cooked, kick-butt heroism."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,63,"Through it all, Washington’s stillness is emphasized, so much so that the film slows down just to make sure we appreciate the presence and the talent behind it."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,There's a soothing catharsis in the idea that good guys are every bit as capable as bad guys of raining hellfire down on their enemies.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"Mr. Fuqua, while not the world’s most subtle filmmaker, directs the action sequences with bluntness and clarity and effectively uses his star as an oasis of calm in a jumpy, nasty universe."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"The movie is tense and coiled for its first hour, then becomes routine in its second half."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"Fuqua steadily parades his big moments, and the movie works as unhinged spectacle. As a thriller it's less certain."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,60,"Though overstretched and a trifle ponderous, this is a solidly acceptable star vehicle with more than enough righteous vengeance for an evening of classy thrills."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"There’s a special kind of hell for artists who array vigilante revenge-porn in saintly garb, and Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua should go to the front of that damnable line after The Equalizer."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"This Equalizer is a brooding, brutal origin tale, one that starts well but steadily caves into genre clichés. It’s a B-movie sheep in A-movie clothing, acceptable meathead mayhem as long as you know what you’re paying for."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"Mr. Fuqua, who did such a fine job directing Mr. Washington and Ethan Hawke in ""Training Day,"" loses control of an increasingly slapdash script, and the whole movie turns into a slaughterhouse. The question isn't who wants it — box office action is assured — but who needs it?"
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"For an hour or so The Equalizer glides along and works; in the second hour, plus change, it turns into a shameless slaughter contrivance with a flabby sense of pace. I did like one line: ""When you pay for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too."" Washington's the rain; by the end, the movie is the mud."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"Not particularly sophisticated, the searing intensity of revenge in The Equalizer is still occasionally arresting (and even entertaining) in its stylish hard-R violence."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,50,"Ponderously overlong and not even half as much fun as it should have been, The Equalizer still gets a lot of mileage out of Washington’s unassailable star presence."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,42,The lunacy to which The Equalizer descends is especially disappointing because the movie starts out with some promise.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,42,"It’s just more joyless junk, another title to bury at the bottom of Fuqua’s resume."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,42,It's a dull film.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,40,Fuqua’s film is lacking much of an intelligible plot other than “tough hombre rights wrongs in ways pushing the boundaries of a 15 rating”.
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,40,"Say this for The Equalizer: It gets the job done, and that job, to quote A Clockwork Orange, is delivering a little of the old ultra-violence."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,40,"Denzel is so cool, so made of pure nails he can make even the most preposterous action scene feel thrilling. But Denzel's strength is also his weakness."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,38,"All this should build up to a moderately engaging battle of wits, but Richard Wenk's script has little interest in wit and no capacity for psychology."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,25,"For all of The Equalizer’s overkill, Washington retains an admirable air of seriousness, embodying McCall as a believable figure of purity and protection, even when he’s going after his opponents with methodical, thoughtfully choreographed sadism."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,25,"It's the sign of an empty, depressing experience when the only tension is over Bob's choice to use a power drill or a weed whacker for his next kill."
The Equalizer,7.2,101530738,20,The Equalizer is a stone-dumb movie.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,88,"Fresh and delightfully offbeat, The Accountant proves that a thriller can be complex and nuanced while fulfilling its mission to entertain."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,88,"The premise of accountant as action hero might seem absurd, but The Accountant makes it credible and fascinating."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,88,"Madness abounds in The Accountant, an intense, intricate, darkly amusing and action-infused thriller that doesn’t always add up but who cares, it’s BIG FUN."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,80,"The Accountant is a nifty piece of genre entertainment, its wacky edge and genial tone despite that body count coming as something of a pleasant surprise in a year rife with lumbering, over-amped blockbusters."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"The thing that makes The Accountant unique, however, and elevates it above the garden variety action-thriller, is that the title character’s “superpowers” result from his autism."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"The victory of The Accountant is in the tone. The title character isn’t presented as a superfreak – this isn’t ""Rain Man,"" in which autistic gifts are presented as powers for parlour tricks – but as a prototype and a beautiful mutant, maybe even a superhero."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"On the whole, it's a mess of action clichés built on top of a shaky premise that's so out-of-this-world that it'll either enrage you - or make you laugh. I chose the latter. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had a lot of fun at this movie."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,"One of the opening scenes of The Accountant consists of puzzle pieces being dumped on a table, and that’s a fine metaphor for the film.... A few pieces can’t be made to fit, and two of those are big ones. (More on that in a minute.) But the rest of the story has been well-constructed, and the picture it gradually reveals keeps you guessing up to the final scene."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,75,Ben Affleck brings needed nuance to old-fashioned brains and brawn as an action hero with high-functioning autism in The Accountant.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,70,An effective and even affecting pop thriller.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,70,The Accountant is nothing if not a puzzle — not so much a jigsaw as a three-dimensional brain teaser that gets deeper and stranger with each new revelation.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,70,"Audiences willing to just go with the movie’s outlandish lead character will find laughs and thrills along the way, as well as that rarest of studio properties: a tentpole that actually leaves you enthusiastic about the prospect of a sequel."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,67,"For every moment that feels overly self-serious, there are two that promise this thing’s some kind of pop-schlock classic."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,63,"True to the profession it sets out to glamorize, The Accountant takes advantage of its share of creative loopholes — and manages to break even in the process."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,63,"The Accountant keeps you hanging on all the way to the looney-toon ending, well past the point where your higher brain functions have called it a night. It’s not a good movie but it’s not a bad way to kill a few hours."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"The action-thriller The Accountant is laughable, but when you’re not laughing at it, you’re laughing with it. It’s enjoyable enough."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"The problem is that endings matter. I was thrilled at watching more than an hour of Ben Affleck playing Christian Wolff as a socially awkward, arithmetically gifted, martial arts expert sharpshooter. But then the plot devolved into nonsense for the final stretch, leaving me wanting to garnish the filmmakers' wages."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"The world-building is engrossing. The premise is refreshingly peculiar. The action grabs your attention. As long as the movie keeps a lid on what precisely is going on, it works."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,60,"All the more frustrating because of its conceptual freshness and Ben Affleck's sly turn in the title role, this sleek action thriller ends up delivering standard shoot-'em-up goods after initially suggesting it might provide something rather different."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,58,"The whole thing’s ludicrous, down to the last loony twist, but it’s also a lot more fun than Batman v Superman."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The Accountant is so many baffling things, most (but not all) of which can not be described in a positive manner."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Thrillers can be a valid Hollywood escape, but this one made me as uncomfortable as its hero is with small talk."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The Accountant would be more entertaining if it just acknowledged its own nerdy outlandishness. Still, it’s something to watch Affleck play a man who has trouble expressing his feelings and struggles to read those of others."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"I admit I would've had a hard time getting through it without the help of Simmons and Addai-Robinson, over there in the B plot. The character at the center of the story is treated with respect and admiration, but in dramatic terms he's about as real-world plausible as Batman."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"It goes very far south, with two plot reveals that are among the most ludicrous that I’ve experienced in quite some time."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Much of it is enjoyable and has the aura of a superior action film, but it collapses into a laughable wreck and ultimately reveals itself as a mild waste of two hours."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The script, by Bill Dubuque, goes sideways in a hurry. Characters do inexplicable things for no reason other than advancing the plot, and sometimes not even that. There is a jaw-dropping coincidence that is as ridiculous as it is obvious."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"At various times, The Accountant aspires to a slick corporate-espionage thriller, a no-nonsense action flick, a tortured family drama, a quirky romantic comedy, and an earnest PSA about autism. At nearly all times, it’s preposterous."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Conceptually, The Accountant kills it, but in terms of execution, The Accountant doesn’t add up."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"For all its respectable airs, The Accountant mostly induces shrugs. Sometimes, B-movies fare better when they settle for being their lowbrow selves."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Director Gavin O’Connor (“Warrior”) is at a loss in trying to shape this into a lean, chilly action picture. The fights and shootouts work, some of the accounting stuff is funny, but the rest is a muddle."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The latest from director Gavin O’Connor (Warrior) is part character study and part airport-novel nonsense, and the film’s utter chutzpah gives the proceedings an agreeable kick. But The Accountant can’t balance its B-movie instincts with its more artistic aspirations, ultimately hamstringing a potentially juicy, escapist shoot-‘em-up."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"Seemingly primed to deliver daffy thrills, The Accountant instead goes about its noble-killer business with all the excitement of an IRS audit."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,50,"The film juggles a “follow the money” procedural with corporate espionage thriller, producing two competing tones that never reconcile into one fluid narrative."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,42,"Director Gavin O’Connor and screenwriter Bill Dubuque have made a textbook example of the ""what were they thinking?"" movie genre. Judging from the befogged look on some of the actors’ faces, they must have been wondering the same thing."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,42,"While “Jason Bourne meets Temple Grandin” might sound like an interesting idea for a studio write-off, “James Bond meets Michael Clayton meets Rain Man meets all of their friends and enemies” is a dull movie that’s too full of distractions to pay out any dividends."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,40,The one thing there’s no accounting for in The Accountant is taste.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,40,"Character motivations are glossed over, explanatory scenes are jammed in haphazardly, and the finale relies on a tonally bizarre combination of schmaltz, coincidence and violence that seems to betray the arc of the whole movie."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,40,"The Accountant uses a cliched and misleading presentation of disability to produce a cliched Hollywood action lead in a cliched action plot, and then babbles cliches about the importance of embracing difference. Despite its protestations to the contrary, the only thing that sets The Accountant apart from its peers is its irritating, clueless hypocrisy, and its lousy title."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,33,The Accountant tallies up its numbers for an achingly long 50 minutes before it starts to finally piece together any semblance of a structured plot.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,30,Here's two hours of grimly serious puzzle-box dramatics and beat-downs starring Ben Affleck as an Affleck-shaped void.
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,30,"The movie, directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Tumbleweeds”), makes little sense. The screenplay, by Bill Dubuque, is so determined to hide its cards that when the big reveal finally arrives, it feels as underwhelming as it is preposterous."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,25,"Preposterous can be defined in many, many ways. But for now, let's use the plot details of The Accountant as Exhibit A."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,25,"Ben Affleck is Agent Double-OCD in The Accountant, an effortlessly dumb thriller barely more entertaining than an audit."
The Accountant,7.3,86260045,20,"The Dark Knight director has had a mortifying effect on movies. In this case, it’s almost as if Affleck’s somber plunge into the calamitous, Nolan-produced ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" has followed him into other projects, like a heavy cologne. Avoid this one like the stink it is."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,This improbably magnificent film and Michael Giacchino’s majestic score are a perfect match.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"War for the Planet of the Apes may have the body of an action film, but it has the soul of an art-house drama and the brains of a political thriller."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"Reeves keeps the action moving steadily, never letting the film’s 140 minutes feel even slightly bloated, and surrounds Caesar with a visually stunning, compassionately conceived group of side characters."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"There is a scene toward the end of War for the Planet of the Apes that is as vivid and haunting as anything I’ve seen in a Hollywood blockbuster in ages, a moment of rousing and dreadful cinematic clarity that I don’t expect to shake off any time soon."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,It would be hard to overstate just how singular this picture feels in its seriousness of purpose and in its cumulative power to enthrall and astonish.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,100,"The effects are incredible, the action is exciting, the music is great, and Andy Serkis, once again embodying a non-human character through motion-capture technology, remains terrific. But there’s something more here."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,95,"War for the Planet of the Apes is an excellent closing act to this rebooted trilogy, but also one that does enough world-building that the series can potentially continue from here – and it’s a rare case where, after three movies, we’re left wanting more."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,91,War for the Planet of the Apes seals Caesar's place in the pantheon of movie messiahs and the trilogy's place among the finest ever.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,91,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a formidable conclusion (if indeed it is) to one of the more well-considered modern series to date. This is a film of difficult, lingering questions and painful revelations."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,War for the Planet of the Apes is the rare blockbuster that’s both entertaining and full of complexity.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a formidable achievement: not just the rare last chapter in a trilogy that maintains the high quality of the first two, but a visually lush, heart-pounding summer action movie that dares to ask hard questions about the struggle between good and evil—both on the larger social scale and within each individual—and the fate of life on Earth."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,"The cast is all top-notch. Harrelson can peel and eat scenery like a bunch of bananas, but he’s mostly in control here. Andy Serkis is beautifully intense as Caesar, and Steve Zahn a welcome addition as the scaredy-cat Bad Ape."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,90,"It’s engrossing every inch of the way, with casualties, infighting, character flaws, war mongering, and some delicious grandstanding from Harrelson."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,89,"A glorious, action-and-pathos packed capstone to the rebooted Apes franchise."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,War for the Planet of the Apes marks the apex of what has been a bludgeoning season of spectacle cinema.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"This is a vital, original, and emotionally potent chapter to one of the longest-running movie series out there. It will easily be one of the summer of 2017’s best films and, at the end of the year, it will likely find a space on many respectable Top 10 lists."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"Reeves achieves visual wonders even in the stillness before all hell breaks loose. It's what makes War for the Planet of the Apes such a unique and unforgettable experience – that, and Serkis's career-high performance. Hail Caesar, indeed."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"Gripping, visually assured and working far above its summer-sequel paygrade, War for the Planet of the Apes treats a harsh storyline with a solemnity designed to hoist the tale of Caesar, simian revolutionary — the Moses of apes — into the realm of the biblical."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"Serkis is brilliant and memorable and sometimes absolutely heartbreaking as Caesar. The supporting players excel, with each getting a moment or two in the sun."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,"While it may be a few beats too long, especially in its multiple endings, it’s a shockingly memorable movie, the kind that gets better as you dissect and discuss how much it does right after the lights have gone up. And, let’s not forget this important factor for summer movie dollars, it’s wildly entertaining."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,88,The satisfying and heart-wrenching climax is a last reminder that Caesar’s new adventure is one of this summer’s best.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"The film could have been improved by dropping a few battles, and I wish Caesar were not the only ape with the power of human speech. I, for one, would love to hear what Maurice the orangutan sounds like spouting the King’s English."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"Like Caesar and company, the films seem to be getting more intelligent and human as they evolve."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"Brimming with emotional intelligence, the human texture Reeves delivers in Apes separates his film from the rest of the tentpole pack."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,83,"With War for the Planet of the Apes, technological wizardry and first-rate storytelling combine into a bracing action-adventure that concludes the best science fiction trilogy since the original trio of “Star Wars” movies."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"Foregoing breadth in favour of depth, War is at its core a character study disguised as a science fiction epic."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"This movie takes big risks, and many of them pay off. War for the Planet of the Apes proves that big movies aren’t incompatible with big ideas."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"Flawed but impressive, War for the Planet of the Apes finds its place comfortably, and near the top, of a surprisingly satisfying summer season. It’s a smart take on the old films, making this a series that can stand alone in its own right."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"The monkey business is somber, brutal and utterly persuasive in this dazzling third entry of a sci-fi series that's only getting better."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"It’s not going to change the summer-blockbuster landscape single-handedly, but at least it comes by its thrills honestly: This is a spectacle that trusts us to think."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"The fact that a genre entry of this nature, with no intrinsic need of being philosophically nuanced, goes out of its way to endow even its ostensible villains with comprehensible motives rates as a notable achievement."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"The conflict here is one of morality, identity and the boundaries of humanity; all the guns and napalm, while present, are secondary to War’s purpose."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"Reeves marshals more than his fair share of battle scenes and sweeping set-pieces, but never forgets the flicker of a face can provide all the spectacle that cinema requires."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,80,"It’s an engrossing, forthright adventure."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"Apologies to Charlton Heston loyalists, but War for the Planet of the Apes is a good example of how today’s movies sometimes beat the hell out of the oldies."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"In the new film, War for the Planet of the Apes — the best of the series, by far — the series’ viewpoint comes into focus, and it’s a lot more intricate and enlightened than some unthinking death wish."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"War for the Planet of the Apes plays like a mash-up of about five different movies, but at least one of them feels like a masterpiece."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"The contributions of the actors now blend more seamlessly with the animation to create digital characters, and the characters are being integrated more successfully and believably into the landscape — director Matt Reeves works on a big widescreen canvas of sweeping, picturesque exteriors."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"What we’re left with in War for the Planet of the Apes is an absorbing, intelligent finale. The film builds to an ending that, although not particularly surprising, feels appropriate—even inevitable—considering all that’s come before."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"Serkis again proves that in the highly specialized realm of performance-capture acting, he has no peer."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,"The end result is too boxed in by the demands of the franchise era and the usual restrictions of a PG-13 rating to qualify as art. It can’t show morally troubling violence or embrace hopelessness, and its day trip into the heart of darkness has to end with a ray of sunshine—“The horror, the horror...” in quotation marks."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,It’s not just the CG that’s visually impressive here; “War” boasts some extraordinary set pieces.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,75,The psychological wars that have made the prequels simmer with tightly wound tensions are given their most cutting treatment yet.
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,70,"The main problem with War for the Planet of the Apes is that, although it rouses and overwhelms, it ain’t much fun."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,70,"While War for the Planet of the Apes's third act is a bit hairy, the sequel helps cement the franchise as one of the more exciting mainstream properties worth watching."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,60,"This solid if unspectacular finish to the Apes trilogy features an A-game Andy Serkis and incredible VFX, but its darker excesses threaten to suffocate at times."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,58,"War of the Planet of the Apes has all the bombast and sense of finality seemingly required for the end of a trilogy, but there’s an underlying emptiness that nags with each scene."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,50,"War for the Planet of the Apes manages to be both alienating and sappy, and the biblical finale seems to come from a different universe altogether. It’s an awesome, dull movie."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,50,"To me, it’s just another “Jurassic World,” technology and production design on a whole new plane, story, dialogue and characters that we’ve seen before (too often), the entire hyped and over-rated enterprise half-forgotten before it hits Netflix."
War for the Planet of the Apes,7.5,146880162,50,"It’s fitting that the visual effects have advanced so dramatically since 2011, as it allows the series to suggest that its ape protagonists have evolved to an equivalent degree, and yet, “War’s” story is beneath their intelligence."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,100,"The Harrison Ford-Sean Connery father-and-son team gives Last Crusade unexpected emotional depth, reminding us that real film magic is not in special effects."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,90,"Though it cannot regain the brash originality of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' in its own way 'The Last Crusade' is nearly as good, matching its audience's wildest hopes."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,90,"It is just as well that Last Crusade will indeed be Indy's last film. It would be too sad to see the series grow old and thin, like the James Bond movies."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,88,"Start lining up now, bring a bullwhip -- and maybe some d-Con. Indiana will do the rest."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,88,"Despite strong acting (the slapstick energy between Ford and Connery is wasted), obligatory chases and stunts and splendid art direction, the virtuoso technique evident in every frame remains formulaic--unaccompanied by revelation, epiphany or surprise."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,80,"The first of Spielberg's films to make us feel heavy in our seats, the first to leave us sitting, passive and uninvolved, on the outside. Watching it, you feel that nearly anyone could have directed it."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,8.2,197171806,75,"Mechanical, soulless."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,80,Berg immerses us so completely into the horror of these men’s situation that we are gripped throughout. The fighting is incredibly intense.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,80,"All four performances are first-rate, and the action is staged with shattering intensity."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,80,"Berg, who wrote and directed, is more interested in how men deal with battle than the ideals or the politics that put them there. What the movie achieves, with a gruesome energy and a remarkable reality, is a firefight."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,Most war films try to be epic in scope and intent. Lone Survivor opts for a smaller focus and succeeds on its own terms.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"The middle 40 minutes of Lone Survivor have to be some of the toughest battle scenes in Hollywood history - an epic, close-range firefight that finds the SEALs throwing themselves down rock faces like superheroes. Only they aren't superheroes - they bleed, they break."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Lone Survivor is primarily about the unflinching bravery of SEALs executing their mission and looking out for one another, even as they’re coming to grips with the reality of how this thing is going to end."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"The surprisingly thoughtful third act both introduces complexity to its portrayal of the Afghan people, and subtly reminds us that, despite Luttrell's astonishing constitution and self-surgery skills, as well as the ultimate sacrifices made by his comrades in arms, it was all for naught."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Like the best war movies, Lone Survivor laces action with moral questions that haunt and provoke."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Wahlberg remains one of our most reliable and least actorly of movie stars, innately macho but vulnerable enough to seem like a human being caught in an inhuman situation."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Conveying a visceral sense of warfare's terror is what Berg chiefly seeks, and on that level Lone Survivor handily succeeds."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,Berg is relentlessly unsparing.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Survivor is a pummeling, frenzied ride, one of fall's most charged action films. The gunfights and rocket-propelled grenades are palpable, and Berg manages to make the chaos followable."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,75,"Together, all four cast members help draw a line across the narrative—separating when we were watching a mildly engaging depiction of names, dates, and locations, and a hellish, immersive situation with no easy outcome in sight."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Lone Survivor has no politics in the sense that it presents a more or less factual story about Luttrell and his comrades trying to fight their way out against overwhelming odds, and tells the truth that most of them didn’t make it. But the visual symbolism and the iconography of this movie are not apolitical or ideologically neutral at all."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"That people want to see a competent action picture in the depths of winter isn’t all that depressing, but the fact that they’re swallowing the disgusting symbolism of this one definitely is."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Lone Survivor’s lack of suspense never works against it. If anything, the fact that the outcome is, at least roughly, known in advance only adds to the film’s sickening tension, the atmosphere of preordained doom through which its characters seem to move."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"It is a modest, competent, effective movie, concerned above all with doing the job of explaining how the job was done."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"The film is rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Berg’s blunt, pummeling style offers few nuances and makes no apologies, but his broad brushstrokes have clearly found an ideal canvas in this grimly heroic rendering of hell on earth."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,70,"Ultimately seems at war with itself, torn between its duties as an entertaining, engaging movie and a somber, sincere memorial, and in splitting the difference, the film effectively assaults its audience almost as aggressively as its subjects."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,68,Not much depth or political examination here. The film works best as a survivalist’s manual.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,Lone Survivor is a somber celebration of courage and endurance that manages to steer clear of jingoism and moral judgments.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,Berg has made a powerful film and an important reminder of what really happens when we send men and women off to war. It's just too bad that subtlety isn't a stronger weapon in his arsenal.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,"For all his directorial shortcomings, Berg has a knack for capturing men at work; his depiction of special-ops maneuvering—of silently casing the enemy base, of planning the attack—is as compelling as the chaotic violence he orchestrates later."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,67,This is a contemporary war-is-hell account in which hell burns so intensely that it scorches the firewalls of the mundane world around it. But it doesn’t burn them down.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,63,"The actors are excellent, as are the bruising re-creations of the firefight and the uncountable injuries sustained."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,63,"The characters are only superficially sketched in, but we still fear for them, understand their code and above all else, appreciate the dirty, bloody, high-risk work these professionals do. That they go through all this and risk everything, by choice, is something Berg, to his credit, never lets us forget."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,63,"The direction pummels and the cast impress, yet Berg’s war movie promises more than it delivers. Memories of Battleship are sunk, but that Oscar buzz may be a bit premature."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"Neither an anti-war tract nor a jingoistic rallying cry, the brutal but humane Lone Survivor instead registers as a howl of despair for so many young men and women lost in war."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"A severe portrait of fortitude under extreme pressure, somewhat marred by blinkered politics."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"While Lone Survivor is presented as a piece of hero-focused entertainment, it is a suitably sobering one in the end, and a film that is bound to stick to the ribs of audiences longer than, say, your average Superman movie."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"You may salute Lone Survivor for its desperate intensity; but the film remains pinned down by its military and political dilemma: between gung-ho and F—, no."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,60,"Lone Survivor, from start to finish, is a tale of disaster, of bad luck and bad communication, perhaps even faulty planning, though that's hard to say. So the movie loses the common touch of average folk trying to get by, while also losing some of the pleasure of watching a crack unit at work."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"Lone Survivor burns with the fever of a passion project. Writer-director Peter Berg's gratitude to United States servicemen for all their sacrifice comes through viscerally, from first frame to last."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"Lone Survivor is a grotesque action movie at times impressively directed by Peter Berg that combines the brute masculinity with the ugliness of the battlefield and viscerally unsettling shock value. But it's less a depiction of courage than a brutish magnification of anger and pain, both of which it conveys a lot better than the high ground that it reaches for."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"The simplicity of Lone Survivor eventually becomes a handicap, because after a certain point, the film becomes just one long battle sequence, lacking narrative ebb and flow."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,There hasn’t been this bizarre mixture of hooah and death since John Wayne hung up his combat boots.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,50,"Crudely written, rife with clichés, and leaves out anything that would transform a piece of propaganda into a work of art akin to Samuel Fuller’s ""The Steel Helmet,"" Brian DePalma’s ""Casualties of War,"" or Steven Spielberg’s ""Saving Private Ryan."""
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,40,Peter Berg’s ultra-bloody battle film “Lone Survivor” is ultimately more grueling than satisfying. It’s more carnage than cinema.
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,40,"Like his prior ""The Kingdom,"" Peter Berg's film pretends to dabble in a frothy moral ambiguity, swiftly betraying its true aims with trigger-happy jingoism."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,38,"What’s missing here is something, or rather, someone, to care about."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,37,"Lone Survivor just reads like a quasi-political exaggeration of a slasher film: the cellphones that don't work, the rescuers just out of reach, the killers chasing our victims through the woods."
Lone Survivor,7.5,125095601,30,"Berg may be adhering to the basic facts, but his movie’s childish machismo is a disgrace to all involved."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"So what's left for the audience to hook into? Only pounding action, elegant style, steady-state suspense, marvelous acting and, despite that droll pooh-poohing every now and then, haunting explorations of youth, age and personal destiny. It's a lot to claim for a sci-fi thriller, but I was blown away by Rian Johnson's Looper."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"Looper is a tremendous motion picture experience. Not merely a ""very good"" one, but a great one."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"Intelligent science-fiction sometimes seems an endangered species - too much physics and there's a risk of creating something cold and remote, too many explosions and get lost in the multiplex. Looper isn't perfect, but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz: it has a brain, courage and a heart."
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"Director Rian Johnson's resulting film, a cornfield neo-noir, is the coolest, most-confident sci-fi flick since 2006's ""Children of Men."""
Looper,7.4,66486205,100,"The best sci-fi movie since ""Moon."" The best time-travel yarn since ""12 Monkeys."" And one of the best films of 2012. You'll immediately want to see it again."
Looper,7.4,66486205,91,"Looper is a remarkable feat of imagination and execution, entertaining from start to finish, even as it asks the audience to contemplate how and why humanity keeps making the same rotten mistakes."
Looper,7.4,66486205,91,"Johnson keeps it simple, yet never stupid. Looper is a puzzle engaging your brain, rather than frying it, as one character describes the process. Obviously he has seen enough movies on the subject by 2024 to know how frustrating that is. This one plays fair with the fantasy."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"I'm not ready to proclaim Looper a sci-fi masterpiece just yet; let's let it sit awhile. But it's a lean, mean, smart, violent picture with a bit of Stanley Kubrick edge, fueled by the terrific Gordon-Levitt."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"This is a highflying, super-stylish science-fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind-bending genre material. We're not always sure where this time-travel film is going, but we wouldn't dream of abandoning the ride."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"Looper may not have the bell-ringing resonance of Chris Marker's ""La Jetée,"" one of its touchstones, but it's a jaunty match-up of genre and character drama that's far smarter and more finely wrought than almost anything else in the multiplexes."
Looper,7.4,66486205,90,"Looper makes a full-meal entertainment out of piecemealing genres: It boasts the kicky mental gymnastics that come with time-travel terrain, the relentless rapid heart rate of a crackerjack thriller, and the bursts of extreme violence, buttressed with black humor, of a modern actioner."
Looper,7.4,66486205,89,"This is an exciting, exceptionally well-made futuristic thriller that also happens to be loaded with lived-in touches and punchy ideas."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"Thanks to the assured hold Johnson exerts over this ingeniously structured game of cat-and-cat, we'll go anyplace he has in mind."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"An indie-inflected popcorn movie with major brains, brilliant acting and a highly satisfying payoff, Looper is the first must-see movie of the season."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"When so much of what Hollywood churns out is almost instantly forgettable, it says a lot about a film when viewers want to take time to argue, ponder and puzzle over it."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"Lacing tremendously exciting action with touching gravity, Looper hits you like a shot in the heart."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"Late in Looper, when a highly telekinetic kid starts levitating things, it really does look like Christopher Nolan had wandered onto the set and taken over."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"The leads blend as seamlessly as any young-old character coupling I've seen. The prosthetically altered Gordon-Levitt, unrecognizable at first, really resembles Willis."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,This film leads to a startling conclusion that wipes out the story's paradoxes so neatly it's as if it never happened. You have to grin at the ingenuity of Johnson's screenplay.
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"As in the very best Anthony Mann and John Ford westerns, Looper at once understands the visual power of violence and is deeply critical of it."
Looper,7.4,66486205,88,"While the third act inevitably bogs down a bit in gunplay and chases, there are more than enough moments of visual wonder and storytelling surprise to make it worth the trip."
Looper,7.4,66486205,83,"The time swivels in Looper evoke some of Inception's fancy temporal tricks... But it's the glimpses of Children of Men-like societal dystopia that give the movie its real weight, and distinguish Johnson's third feature as a marked step forward."
Looper,7.4,66486205,83,Perhaps the most thrilling thing about Looper is watching Johnson really grow leaps and bounds as a filmmaker.
Looper,7.4,66486205,83,"A fanciful film with the patina of hyper-realism, Looper is well served by actors who behave not as if they were dropped carelessly into the future but spent their whole desperate lives there."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Gordon-Levitt is flinty, and Willis, on his A-game, is fiery. Together, they take us on a helluva trip."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Gordon-Levitt has been so terrific for a while now that he's become a magnetic presence; Willis is also on a nice streak, not as strong here as in ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" but still quite good."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Thrilling in its deft juggling of complex narrative elements, utterly clear in its presentation, and unfolding with what feels like serious moral purpose, Looper still can't help but suggest that its larger ambitions are something of a put-on, a nice thematic polish to set off its interpersonal drama."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"As time-travel action films go, here's one that's brainy, stylish and carries itself with B-flick modesty - all of which feels like some kind of alchemy."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"If high-toned futuristic time-travel pictures with a splash of romance float your boat the way they do mine, you'll have yourself a time."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Their physical disparity notwithstanding, Gordon-Levitt and Willis both come across strongly, while Blunt effectively reveals Sara's tough and vulnerable sides."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"In a genre infamous for loose ends, this thinking man's thriller marshals action, romance and a dose of very dark comedy toward a stunning payoff."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"Once you commit to the lexicon – to the blunderbusses, the silver, the loops that close and the loops let run – you're in for a breathless ride. It's been a patchy summer for sci-fi, absent of anything that really sticks in the mind. Johnson's deep, distinctive film plays on repeat."
Looper,7.4,66486205,80,"My favorite line in the movie comes when Gordon-Levitt, in a face-off with his mob boss (Jeff Daniels), informs him that he'd like to leave the business one day and move to France, to which Daniels replies: ""I'm from the future; you should go to China."""
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"Looper, a cocky sci-fi tale with more brass than substance, is rife with these ""Say what?"" moments."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"Looper ups the ante like a poker player on speed. What a potpourri of genres we have here – noir again, but sci-fi too, and action and horror and psycho-drama with existential trimmings, the latter designed to invite the thinking viewer into the fray."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"The casting is carefully considered, as well, from Willis, whose Old Joe is even more dangerous than Young Joe, to Emily Blunt, who goes American this time and plays a young mother with a winning warmth and vulnerability."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"With Looper, Johnson proves he can finesse the most complicated notions and visual setups his mind can imagine. It's the simple things that still elude him."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"While Looper lacks the heft of a classic, this wayback machine is worth taking for a spin."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"For about an hour Looper really cooks. Its second half is more of a medium boil, and less fun. But watching it, I realized how few commercial entertainments hold up straight through to the end-point."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"There's a adrenaline rush even in the problematic finish, an eagerness that drives the filmmaking so that Looper is thrilling to watch even when it falls apart."
Looper,7.4,66486205,75,"Mr. Johnson throws a lot at the screen, blasted corpses included, yet little here is as initially transfixing as Mr. Gordon-Levitt's mug."
Looper,7.4,66486205,70,"The resulting slowdown, as well as a significant narrative shift, gives Looper a slightly sprawling and ungrounded feel at times, almost as if the first and second halves are two separate movies."
Looper,7.4,66486205,60,"Looper felt to me like a maddening near-miss: It posits an impossible but fascinating-to-imagine relationship...and then throws away nearly all the dramatic potential that relationship offers. If someone remakes Looper as the movie it could have been in, say, 30 years, will someone from the future please FedEx it back to me?"
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,83,"Yet nothing in their visually stimulating film registers as strongly as Jolie’s enigmatic, ever-changing face."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,80,"Angelina Jolie is so wickedly enchanting in the magical, magnificent Maleficent, you may not notice how transporting this female-driven blockbuster really is."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,80,"A few bumpy patches notwithstanding, the new feature is an exquisitely designed, emotionally absorbing work of dark enchantment."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"A moderately enchanting, sometimes thought-provoking corrective to the flaws in the story that inspired it."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,Jolie's Maleficent is magnificent.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"In truth, you just can’t wait until the wicked Jolie returns to the screen. Whether a malevolent twinkle illuminates her beady eye or a heartbreaking tear rolls down her alabaster cheek, she is the film’s power."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"Calling Maleficent a ""modern-day classic,"" as some have asserted, is overreaching. The production is engaging and appealing but only the passage of time will determine whether it holds in the memory with the strength of its animated predecessor."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,"The movie is a mess, but it's a rich mess. It has weight. It matters."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,Maleficent imparts a feeling of enchantment. Here is a world that's strange and beautiful.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,75,The result is a rare live-action Disney movie that merits comparison to its beloved feature-length cartoons.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,70,"Whatever its flaws, Maleficent is a family-friendly Disney adventure that offers a relaunched and thoroughly delightful Angelina Jolie."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,70,This is really a movie about the evil spell Jolie casts on us — it’s both a celebration and a demonstration of her formidable movie star might.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,70,"Though it never plays like a polemic, the film has so much it wants to say the emotional power that might have made it a classic is undercut."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,67,"Imaginatively, it places all the known elements of the story in different contexts, completely recasting this familiar fairy tale into a more poignant and resonant work."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,67,"Maleficent feels spit-balled into more directions than barely 90 minutes of story time can adequately cover. It's once upon a time, happily ever after and a lot of undeveloped drama in between."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,67,"The characters are boiled down to their essentials, the humor is timelessly broad, and Jolie's at her best when she's curling her claws and elongating her vowels like a black-sabbath Tallulah Bankhead."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,63,"For all its limitations, Maleficent manages to be improbably entertaining to watch, due solely to its title character. As befits a star of her regal standing and superb self-awareness, Angelina Jolie has managed to bend even the Brothers Grimm to her indomitable will."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,63,"While this is Jolie’s show, obviously — and she’s terrifically arch — the surprising dearth of other compelling characters doesn’t offer much distraction when things get off track."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,63,"This is almost entirely Angelina Jolie's show...this is a performance that goes from point A to point B without seeming rote, or ho-hum."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"Enchanting enough to cast a spell over fans, of Jolie, of Disney, of ""Sleeping Beauty"" -- and of pure, cinematic escapism."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"Consciously or not, coherently or not, Maleficent tells a new kind of story about how we live now, not once upon another time. And it does so by suggesting, among other things, that budding girls and older women are not natural foes, even if that’s what fairy tales, Hollywood and the world like to tell us."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"If you go into Maleficent expecting Jolie to be the badass of Sleeping Beauty, you’re going to get burned."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"Despite its pitfalls, Maleficent entertains because of Jolie, who holds the wavering threads of Stromberg's spinning wheel together with aplomb."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"The aggressively unpleasant visuals certainly detract from the overall film, but Maleficent makes for a fascinating entry in an ongoing wave of projects that give “bad” women of literature a chance to present their side of the story."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,60,"The action sequences are executed with rhythm and punch, and our heroine swoops and swirls around like Iron Man in a sheath dress. Maleficent may be short on true enchantment, but until we find a superhero who can pull off a black silk cocktail gown in battle, she’s very welcome."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,It’s a dazzling showcase of fantasy-based filmmaking in the 21st century that also manages a feeble attempt at injecting feminist politics into an antiquated narrative. Yet its eventual climax strains from the obviousness of these efforts.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,"Director Robert Stromberg, making his debut as a director after supervising the visual effects for movies like “Alice in Wonderland” and “Avatar,” lacks the transcendent touch."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,"While I can see how there is a version of this film that might be able to successfully grapple with its central metaphor, I'm not sure Stromberg is the guy to make that movie."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,58,More well-intentioned than accomplished.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,Jolie’s commitment to the part is admirable: She gives this Maleficent a real emotional urgency. But the rest of the movie lets her down.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"It fails to live up to its early promise, mostly because of an uneven tone and murky character development"
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,Maleficent is out of balance in all sorts of ways. The effective silent sequences conflict with the frustratingly talky ones. The new material fits poorly with moments that directly quote the classic.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"Jolie's performance so overshadows the rest of the cast (and the rest of the movie) that you sometimes feel as if the other characters are, like us, just standing around watching her. This is not, however, the fault of the other actors. It's the fault of screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who doesn't give them much to do that's challenging or interesting."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,Impressive. And violent. Just not a lot of fun.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"Why tell the Sleeping Beauty story anew? With this half-hearted film, Mr. Stromberg, the visual effects wizard behind such big-budget blockbusters as ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Avatar,"" can’t provide an answer."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,50,"Uncertain of tone, and bearing visible scarring from what one imagines were multiple rewrites, the film fails to probe the psychology of its subject or set up a satisfying alternate history, but it sure is nice to look at for 97 minutes."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,42,"Maleficent desperately tries to create a character whose motivation you will understand and empathize with. But the screenplay and direction are such a tangled, thorny patch of conflicting ideas that it's hard to tell what that motivation is supposed to be."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,40,"If this tiresome yarn is the ‘true’ story of one of Disney’s most popular villains then, please, give us colourful lies and happy ignorance."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,40,This icon of witchcraft can't save a production that's suffocatingly elaborate yet insufficiently bewitching.
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,40,"With more actual grrrl power, Maleficent would be a bold redo. Instead, it's a beautiful snooze, a story that hints at the darkness underneath our fairy tales and tarnishes the idea of true love without quite daring to say what's really on its mind: that even the best of us might not live happily ever after."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,38,"Maleficent is an admittedly great-looking, sometimes creepy, often plodding and utterly unconvincing re-imagining of a famous romantic fairy tale as a female empowerment metaphor."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,38,"Jolie comes to this party ready to bite, but the movie muzzles her. Even at 97 minutes, Maleficent is still one long, laborious slog."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,38,"We may have all wanted to know the story behind those famed horns, but the mystery was far preferable to having Maleficent de-fanged and de-clawed in the process."
Maleficent,7.0,241410378,30,"Except for Angelina Jolie, exemplary as the fairy badmother who laid a narcotic curse on an infant princess, this pricey live-action drama is a dismaying botch."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Smart, wry and awesome, all at once."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"What ensues is never exactly unpredictable, but always witty, fresh and fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Actually lighter, wittier, and more original than it has a right to be."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Savvy without being smug, cute without being saccharin, and funny without slipping into over-the-top goofiness, this is a 14th-century good time."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,80,"Though the picture is definitely flawed, it maintains a joie de vivre that's surprisingly refreshing."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"A Knight's Tale, will either repel you or win you over. It won me over."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"With its cheerful hailstorm of anachronisms and classic-rock soundtrack, there's nothing medieval about it."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"More often than not, it's fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,"It's a reminder of the days before films got so cynical and unrelentingly violent. A Knight's Tale is whimsical, silly and romantic."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,Simply a jolly good (k)night out.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,75,It's a dumb summer movie done with smarts.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,The action scenes are beautifully mounted and photographed and offer a sense of the rigors of the sport.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,"Smirking at the audacity of it all is part of the fun, and if nothing else, A Knight's Tale is a hell of a lot of fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,Fine family entertainment.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,70,"There's much to love about this ""Rocky"" on horseback, and those laughable blemishes just fold into jokes that Helgeland likely intends audiences to laugh at."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,67,"The result is half Python, half Ivanhoe--and not as much fun as either."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,Would be sweeter if the fair maiden weren't such a pill and more exciting if the villain weren't quite so nasty.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"The picture itself is good-humored, but bland and predictable. It's a cross between an All-American vaudevillian version of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Mel Brooks's ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights."""
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"Laddish, one joke, genre scrambling rock & roll fairy tale."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,63,"For all its hipness, the movie serves up some awfully old chestnuts."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"From the moment he trudges through the woods in his scratched and smudged birthday suit, Paul Bettany as a saucy Geoffrey Chaucer takes command."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"This brazen mix of old and new is undermined by the predictable story, shallow characterizations and a dopey sense of humor."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,60,"As advertised, A Knight's Tale does try to rock you. The problem is, it doesn't rock you nearly enough."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,58,Works neither as an exuberant rock 'n' roll picture nor as a heroic fable. It will rock you --straight to sleep.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"At best harmless, if not quite fun."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,The result is as flat as a year-old beer commercial.
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"Traditionalists and older viewers in general will scoff, while pop culture addicts will no doubt go with the flow."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,50,"The film's one saving grace is Ledger (Mel Gibson's son in ""The Patriot"")."
A Knight's Tale,6.9,56569702,40,"The skits are dreadful, the jokes suck."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,100,"As a first-time director, Pearce manages something difficult. He creates a tone that acknowledges absurdity, but also consequences. He finds an edge that’s extreme, that’s weird, that’s satirical and that goes right to the edge of farce, and yet the movie is at all points as involving as an intense drama."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,89,"This is one of the major delights of Hotel Artemis: a plot that posits a damaged, Medicare-aged woman as its central figure. And that the role is executed by a two-time Oscar-winning actress delivering her best work in many years makes this a rare treat."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,80,"Hotel Artemis is a bold, loud, ambitious film, far cleverer than the bog-standard summer blockbuster fare, and with sharp humour and driving suspense it makes this pulpy-sci fi thriller a very fun watch."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,80,"Stylishly realised against a backdrop of violence and faded Hollywood glamour, Drew Pearce’s vision of the near-future is laced with intrigue and dark humour."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"While originality may not exactly be in great supply here, these familiar elements have been mixed with enough wit and style to make for some sleazy, insanely violent, and reasonably entertaining B-movie trash."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"High-concept, low-budget, proudly set-bound, Hotel Artemis shouldn’t work at all. Somehow, miraculously, it does."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"Hotel Artemis is neither a sequel nor a remake, but a film of considerable originality. And that makes it a rarity at the multiplex."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"It’s essentially the Hotel Earle from “Barton Fink,” augmented by the latest in robotic surgical techniques for bullet extraction."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,75,"Writer-director Drew Pearce must have done something right to get a cast like this to sign on for what is essentially a loving, highly stylized homage to the kind of camp apocalyptia John Carpenter used to make; the only thing missing here is an Ernest Borgnine cameo and Kurt Russell scowling in an eye patch."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,71,"It’s a stylish and amusing thriller, but a hollow one, with mostly broad-stroke characters populating an otherwise ultra-detailed fictional criminal underworld. Fans of crime movies like John Wick will be entertained by the big ideas and backstories, but they probably won’t form the kind of connection they have to other, better films of its ilk."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,67,"For roughly its first half, Hotel Artemis glides nicely on all of Pearce’s world-building and the cast’s confident performances. But as the power flickers at the Artemis and dangerous foes close in, the movie starts to wobble. Pearce has maybe put too many variables in play and has trouble connecting them into a unified narrative."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,67,"We’ve seen it all before in movies and video games, but the packaging is slick and hard to resist; any sci-fi crime movie with moody camerawork by Chung Chung-hoon, a Cliff Martinez score, a cast this strange, and an original end-credits ballad by Father John Misty (also a cast member) is begging to be watched, regardless of actual content or the messiness of the action scenes."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,67,"Drew Pearce‘s Hotel Artemis...falls victim to much of what ails any ensemble picture — rushed plotting, forced coincidence, indulgence — but still manages to make a big impression."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,63,The humor is often muted and at times almost apologetic and a subplot involving long-ago events fails in its goal of boosting the three-dimensionality of a character.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,63,"There are a lot of moving parts here, and Pearce fits them together with admirable skill. Originality isn’t his strong suit, but “Artemis” has enough snaky twists and turns and moody energy to make it a fun ride."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"Ultimately, in all its artifice and haphazard but enthusiastic invention, Hotel Artemis makes me a bit nostalgic for French ’90s genre fare of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro and, of course, Luc Besson, embracing their daffiness and dreaminess with an somewhat counterintuitive, almost naïve lack of vanity."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"This isn't a movie that pretends to be profound. It's meant purely as B-movie entertainment, and -- also like the ""John Wick"" films -- it's fully aware of that."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"The wannabe thriller set in the near future packs gritty style and ambiance, but that’s no match when the story has no stakes and doesn’t add up."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"The flavorful cast inhabit vividly drawn characters, and, perhaps most of all, the film exudes wall-to-wall, high-grunge atmosphere. That’s a lot of checked-off boxes, and yet the effect is efficiently wild rather than wildly involving, entertaining but not indelible."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"For all of its faults, there’s still plenty here to praise, the result of so much being thrown at the wall is that some of it will stick. Pearce has a sharp creative flair and a head full of ideas but he feels somewhat hemmed in by the constraints of a short running time and a high profile release date."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,60,"Mr. Pearce is also well-versed in staging and shooting decent action scenes, and building suspense enough to keep Hotel Artemis diverting in its overstuffed ambition. Add to that Ms. Foster’s welcome return to big-screen acting after a five-year layoff and you’ve got a movie almost worth seeing."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,58,"Despite the ingredients at hand, Pearce and company never really pull it together in a manner that realizes the potential. The result is a pulp buffet that feels like it should have been a gourmet meal—a Golden Corral of genre conventions (that leaves the audience feeling about as satisfied)."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Positive points to the Hotel Artemis for trying to achieve something original, and for the quality of the cast. But after that bloody boldness, the analogies and the life lessons and the moments of closure are all too predictable and familiar."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"It boasts snappy dialogue, memorable characters, and a gorgeously designed central location but doesn’t quite know what to do with any of the above."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Writer-director Drew Pearce’s Hotel Artemis, however, manages to make the most intriguingly bonkers premise a boring and flat exercise."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Writer and director Drew Pearce makes his feature debut in a confused, jumbled film that never quite gets its story straight."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"There’s nothing especially striking about the movie’s visual presentation – the Artemis is threadbare and creaky, a purposely anachronistic blend of the future tech and throwback furnishings. The actions is competent, the performers game."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,Too many subplots make the story feel cluttered and no more intelligent.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Like many movies set in colourfully bleak futures, Hotel Artemis can’t sustain the novelty of its initial world-building."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,50,"Whether it’s the too-harried pacing or too many central people vying for attention, the film’s heart never quite coalesces. Seizing it is like trying to grab a cloud. Pearce seems to want this movie to be both a neon pulp plot-heavy piece and a character-driven drama, and there’s just not enough time in a single film for all of it to work."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,45,Though it boasts an agreeably preposterous scenario and a weird mixed bag of physicalities and acting styles — from Foster and Sterling K. Brown to Jenny Slate and Dave Bautista — the movie is itself an eye-rolling performance of cyber-pulp tropes and pop-movie excesses that undercuts its spotty pleasures at nearly every turn.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,42,"A handful of amusing details in desperate need of a purpose, the film spends its first half looking for a compelling reason to exist, and its second half trying to disguise the fact that it can’t find one."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,38,Writer-director Drew Pearce has tarted up a dullish action comedy that finds laughs hard to come by and its moral underpinnings shaky.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,38,Hotel Artemis quickly reveals its future setting as an empty pretext for a banally convoluted and sentimentalized show of emotional rehabilitation.
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,25,"Writer and director Drew Pearce has made an uneven feature film directorial debut. He flaps around for a consistent tone, stunts some potential story lines and kicks out a bunch of cliches. Then, clearly unable to find a rational way to end his film, he adds two massive doses of nonsensical ultra-violence."
Hotel Artemis,6.1,6708147,0,"Moronic drivel that truly qualifies as the worst movie of the year, it sinks amateurish moviemaking aimed at audiences with no taste to an alarming new low."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,85,Who cares if the story is occasionally impenetrable or if some gags land with a thud when the thrills and the eye candy keep coming at such a breathless pace? Jupiter Ascending doesn’t break the new ground that the Wachowskis have managed in the past...but the film never slacks in its efforts to wow us.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,83,"Fast, frequently teetering on the cusp of the ridiculous, and eye-poppingly pretty, Jupiter Ascending is a wicked slice of entertainment, and a heck of an antidote to the typical February box-office blahs."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,80,"Both visually and in the action stakes, Jupiter Ascending could give pretty much any space movie a run for its money."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,75,"A film very much of its moment, in ways both good and bad. But the important thing is that its virtues are extraordinary, while its flaws are easy to forget because they’re so common."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,75,"It is, in other words, just a few musical numbers and a whiff of marijuana smoke short of being the Thomas Pynchon book of big-budget, effects-driven movie sci-fi."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,70,"The movie's a fascinating mess, grand and gaudy, often hilarious."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,63,A beautiful muddle.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,63,"Jupiter Ascending feels like a truncated, Cliffs Notes version of something that might have worked a lot better as a mini-series. Two hours is too short for this tale and the end result suffers greatly because of that restriction."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,60,"It’s all very chaotic and entertaining, like a bizarre cult sci-fi TV show that somehow survived a threat of mid-season cancellation."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,60,"This is one mad mess from start to finish... But the sheer ambition is impossible to ignore, and the sense of fun is infectious: you may fear for your sanity during Jupiter Ascending, but you’ll come out smiling."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,58,"Jupiter Ascending’s early cleverness dries up quickly, especially when Kunis is offscreen, leaving us with just another incoherent sci-fi spectacle."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"It has the kind of jumbled, pseudo-spectacular, overdecorated digital design that the eye and mind can’t really take in. Individual shots can be gorgeous, but there are just too damn many of them, and the overall experience is the visual equivalent of eating an entire wedding cake."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"As for Kunis, she gets to wear some out-of-this-world couture, and gets to make her entrance at a marriage ceremony on a floating dais, kind of like Katy Perry at the Super Bowl."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"I enjoyed this movie more than the last two films from the Wachowskis, the interminable ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""Speed Racer."" On the other hand, ""The Matrix"" it's not."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"With its nods to the original “Star Trek” and David Lynch’s proto-steampunk hallucination “Dune,” it seduces the eye with filigreed flourishes even as the mind reels from some of the mildewy storytelling."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"Jupiter Ascending is best during its purely visual moments, of which there are many... All of which makes it a shame that the only sense the Wachowskis can count on is their visual one."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"An instant candidate for the so-bad-it’s-sort-of-great hall of fame, Jupiter Ascending is totally bonkers, a sort of black-velvet-Elvis mash-up of “Star Wars’’ and every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the past half-century right up to “The Hunger Games.”"
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"The movie doesn't really work, but the jet boots would be the envy of Iron Man, and they allow our hero, unwisely named Caine Wise, to speedskate through the air, leaving pretty little trails of light over downtown Chicago."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"Though it strives mightily to compete in every category, it’s not as funny as Guardians, as awe-inspiring as Interstellar, as thrilling as Edge Of Tomorrow, or as provocative as Under The Skin."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,50,"It's blandly, often listlessly bad, check-the-blockbuster-boxes bad, just-out-of-film-school-and-shopping-a-tentpole-screenplay bad."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"Cinema-goers desperately need a fresh, unusual and franchise-free blockbuster to rally behind, but Jupiter Ascending isn’t it."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,The Wachowskis never lack for ambition. It's in the execution where they run into trouble.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"Like too much filmed space opera, this is wonderfully imaginative when it comes to costume, art direction, special effects, spaceships and incidental alien creatures but stuck with old-hat character types and a resolutely unspecial storyline. It’s frequently entertaining, but as much for its terrible moments as its inspired touches."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"Even with all its familiar action tropes, less-than-fresh special effects and loopy plotting, the most depressing element in the Wachowski siblings' latest sci-fi mash is that, as they conceive it, human society has been around for more than a billion years but is still presided over by a rivalrous British-style royal family that treacherously behaves as if it were the 1550s."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,40,"While the Wachowskis have always put their greatest emphasis on aesthetics, they allow the visual impulse to get the best of them here, investing so much attention in creating unique fashions, technology, architecture and design that they’ve blinded themselves to the huge logical gaps in their own story."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"Dazzling to behold yet puny of imagination, the movie takes the “Star Wars” formula — hero myths nicked from Joseph Campbell, cutting-edge visual effects, comic-strip dialogue, goofy-looking aliens — and reduces it to generic Big Box shelf product."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"The sci-fi film's reported $175 million budget must have gone largely into loopy production design, wild costumes, outlandish hairstyles and colorful make-up. It certainly didn't go into developing a coherent script or coaching believable performances."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"The film is ntermittently inventive in its visual and physical effects, but its politics are unthinking and obvious, a cheap anti-authoritarian tantrum imbedded in an intergalactic action-melodrama."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,"Channing Tatum is a lot of things, but he’s not a stoic Superman like the role he plays here, which is made more laughable by prosthetic pointy ears."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,38,An excruciatingly empty chunk of eye candy that spends over two hours trying to convince us they’re not ripping off “Dune.”
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,37,It seems that Andy and Lana Wachowski have never lost that childlike ability to dream. But they also haven’t mastered the grown-up power to rein it in. The story they tell in Jupiter Ascending could probably occupy an entire television season. There’s way too much here for one movie to hold.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,30,"While the totality of Jupiter Ascending is just too much for its own massive narrative heft to support, kudos to the Wachowskis for beating back against mainstream Hollywood by casting actors of all races and genders in key roles, something they’ve been doing since their 1996 debut ""Bound."""
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,"The most frustrating thing about the movie (as with “Cloud Atlas”) is that it could’ve been memorable, had the Wachowskis turned their vision over to more talented storytellers."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,"This kind of pandering FX padding, unnurtured by humor or heart, is what shifts Jupiter Ascending from a shambles to a fiasco. In an effort to win back audiences by lowering their standards and their daring, the Wachowskis wind up where you never expected to find them creatively: on the ropes."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,The creators of Jupiter Ascending spent $175 million on special effects and 25 cents on a story. Audiences do not get their money's worth.
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,25,"Sadly, Jupiter Ascending turns out to be the exact opposite: the worst movie the Wachowskis have ever made."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,20,"Talk about lost in space. The whacked-out outer-space melodrama Jupiter Ascending has embedded in its genes the DNA of “Barbarella” and “Flash Gordon,” some dust from “Dune” and even a bit of Michael Jackson’s Disneyland short “Captain Eo.”"
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,16,"There is an emptiness that lingers around Jupiter Ascending. From the lack of original thought in its conception to the expensive excess in its execution, the directors' usual bag of tricks can't manage to fill the void."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,0,"Heaping derision on such a woeful debut may be tantamount to shooting fossils in a tar pit. Yet this lumbering industrial enterprise, which was written and directed by the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana, is bad enough to be granted landmark status."
Jupiter Ascending,5.3,47387723,0,There’s no defending Jupiter Ascending. There’s no explaining Jupiter Ascending. There’s no way Jupiter Ascending isn’t making an appearance on my list of the Worst Films of 2015.
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,100,"Anyone expecting gritty realism will be disappointed, because Hill is offering something better: shooting entirely on NY locations at night, he has transformed the city into a phantasmagoric labyrinth of weird tribes in fantastic dress and make-up who move over (and under) the streets as untouched as troglodytes by the civilisation sleeping around them. Mixing ironic humour, good music, and beautifully photographed suspense, it's one of the best of 1979."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,100,"For me personally, It’s one film that can’t be redone for the simple fact, there isn’t a living director that can capture what made this movie work! If you’ve never seen this film, I can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s definitely in my TOP 5 of “All time greatest movies.”"
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,90,"The Warriors is a deeply silly movie. Its gangs are ridiculous comic-book figures. Still, director Walter Hill treats its world with total seriousness. Bleak synthesizer drones thrum and throb. The streets glow with slickly inky-black greasiness. Nobody smiles. It’s so awesome."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,80,"The Warriors is a visual feast. Director Hill fills the frame with vibrant colors, bright lights, and nonstop motion. The uniforms of the various gangs are unique, funny, fearsome, and more than a bit theatrical. The exciting fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and instead of focusing on the violence, Hill concentrates on pure movement (most of the cast were actually dancers)."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"The Warriors is a gangland fantasia, cut tighter than a snare drum, made for maximum impact."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"Hill, shooting by night and on location together with his OOP Andrew Laszlo, gives the film dazzling style. New York's oil-slicked streets become a labyrinth lit by pools of reflecting light, both scary and strangely beautiful - grimy realism it isn't. It also manages to humanize the gang-bangers to a surprising extent, illustrating the material and emotional poverty that forces them onto the streets in the first place."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,75,"The Warriors is a comic book morality tale, Westside Story crossed with A Clockwork Orange. The movie is so perversely fascinating in a variety of ways that it’s too bad the imagination demonstrated wasn’t used for something better than what turns out to be one more exploitation film in which the audience is encouraged to cheer the sights and sounds of mayhem."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"The film is as handsome to watch as it is preposterous to listen to, full of gorgeous nocturnal city images that splash blaring neon colors against filthy, rain-slicked gray. Mr. Hill uses subways, jukeboxes, spectacularly eerie costumes and deserted streets to create a stark yet extravagant visual style, and a grimy little world in which everything looks curiously brand-new. Thanks to a lot of wipes and slow-motion shots, you are never in danger of forgetting that somebody clever is at the helm."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"Walter Hill's existential action piece, rendered in a complete stylistic abstraction that will mean tough going for literal-minded audiences. Not quite the clean, elegant creation that his earlier films were, The Warriors admits to failures of conception (occasional) and dialogue (frequent), but there is much of value in Hill's visual elaboration of the material."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"Theme of the pic, based on Sol Yurick’s 1965 novel, is a variation on countless westerns and war films. Update the setting to modern-day New York, and the avenues of escape to graffiti-emblazoned subway cars, and that’s The Warriors."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"The Warriors is a real peculiarity, a movie about street gang warfare, written and directed as an exercise in mannerism. There's hardly a moment when we believe that the movie's gangs are real or that their members are real people or that they inhabit a real city. That's where the peculiarity comes in: I don't think we're supposed to. No matter what impression the ads give, this isn't even remotely intended as an action film. It's a set piece. It's a ballet of stylized male violence."
The Warriors,7.7,22490039,60,"If the movie is not as dangerous as its detractors claim, neither is it as glorious and memorable as some of its less discriminating admirers would have it. I find the spectacle fading from my memory in a jumble of dislocated colors and motions. In retrospect, it seems too studiously unreal."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,91,"The most consistently funny studio sequel in some time, and the rare blockbuster that actually delivers on what it promises."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,88,"It's all fab, baby, a kicky, wiggy sequel that scores on all levels, from the sexy to the sublime."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,"Give your brain the night off, and Myers will make you smile too."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,"As a character, Austin Powers hasn't worn out his welcome, exactly, but he has outlived his novelty."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,80,Places Myers firmly on the top rung of movie comics.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,78,"A collection of arbitrary sketches, bits and improvs jammed into a locker room-style variety show masquerading as some semblance of a narrative."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"Given the choice between a movie that's better structured and only half as funny, I'd take The Spy Who Shagged Me (or its predecessor, for that matter) any day."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"With its outrageous double-entendre, gonzo performances and appalling lack of restraint, the sequel is more than a guilty pleasure."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"Better than anyone dared hope: bigger, more inventive, and more frolicsome than its predecessor, with a grab bag of scatological gags that are almost as riotous when you think back on them."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,75,"There's a rampant looseness to this movie, and it's subversively liberating."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,Turns out to be less than the sum of its wonderfully silly and bizarre parts.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"For my taste, too much of the new Powers looks like bad TV and sounds like old burlesque."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,There is an underlying likability to Austin Powers that sort of carries us through the movie.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"If it all seems a bit dizzying, it is, but there's plenty to enjoy."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"The repulsive turn of events erased all my good memories of the first half, and makes the movie hard to recommend to a normal human being."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,70,"Too much of what The Spy Who Shagged Me has to offer is tired and derivative, and, when the various jokes and gags are tallied, there are many more misses than hits."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,A movie that's nearly as good as its publicity campaign.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,"At this point, the effect of Myers' one-man Sixties love-in already feels less shagadelic than just shagged out."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,Script just doesnt have it in terms of fresh narrative developments or individual gags.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,63,"After a while it becomes apparent that this movie is too eager to please, too willing to sacrifice its point of view toward its targets to sustain itself for the length of a feature."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,60,Several love beads short of its predecessor.  Intermittently hilarious comedy.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,60,"The satire is crammed with sexual and scatological humor; some may find this Rabelaisian and refreshing, while others will detect the end of civilization as we know it."
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,50,Would be too long even if it were twice as funny. And that about sums up the movie.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,6.6,206040086,50,Kills whatever charm the first movie had by recycling its few serviceable parts.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,75,"Quibbles dissipate in the face of the giddiness of the action, which builds to such a relentless head that even the serious stakes of the film’s motivation give way to a largely pleasant vibe."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,70,"It may be messy, but the parts that matter go for broke with breakneck ambition."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,67,"It’s fun and mostly inoffensive, never taking itself too seriously while it rewards its inexplicable fans. Better still, it makes every effort to borrow from the Fast series’ latter-day push for more diverse heroes, something the action genre needs right now."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,63,"Speaking strictly for myself, Vin Diesel, here coming back to play Xander Cage, the James Bond of skateboarding character he originated in 2002’s “XXX” is the least exciting component of this 3D slam-bang fest."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,63,"Pure spectacle has since been subsumed into narrative filmmaking, but the cinema of attractions is always present, especially in modern action movies, and there may be no greater current example of this than xXx: The Return of Xander Cage."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,60,"We've seen all these stunts pulled before, and seen them done better, but there's some pleasure to be had here — even if it's of the extremely guilty kind."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,60,"Vin, great ridiculous beefcake lunk that he is, does provide us with some fun."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,58,"One should applaud Diesel and Caruso for breathing unexpected energy into what could’ve been another lame, uninspired continuation. It’s wild, loud and totally out of control, and that’s periodically a pretty good thing."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"While he has a decent enough handle on the right tone for the proceedings, Caruso’s action sequences are slapdash to the point of incoherence."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"A shift in tone to something like ""Kingsman"" might have made this a more entertaining experience."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,A reasonably entertaining popcorn movie experience.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"The essential question here, of course, is how kickass those action scenes are, since no one’s watching an xXx movie for the plot. (That particular assumption may explain how loose the continuity remains throughout.) The answer is variable."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"It goes without saying that the American public’s relationship to the NSA has changed dramatically since the first xXx movie in 2002 – a sea change that this film seeks to play up – but the script, written by F. Scott Frazier, doesn’t quite know what to do with its critique of the NSA’s unchecked power."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,50,"Rarely do five minutes elapse between some sort of laugh-out-loud absurdity, and the distinction between the film’s intentional and unintentional comedy grows hazier as it goes."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,Collette – usually a delight – sounds like she’s phonetically speaking a foreign language. Not even Judi Dench could sell these lines.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,"Diesel is the star (as well as a producer), in every scene. And he drags the film down with him."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,The film is packed with moments of rank idiocy.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,"The movie wastes chance after chance to pull together a satisfying action sequence, or give us anything to look at that’s not lame, spatially confusing, and badly lit."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,40,"Somewhat impressively, it’s even stupider than this outlandish synopsis sounds, with action that makes the F&F movies look grounded, “hip” dialogue that induces spasms of embarrassment and a shockingly casual disregard for human life."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,38,Return of Xander Cage adds up to a movie “all jacked up on Red Bull and Mountain Dew.” And we all know how bad that stuff is for you.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,30,"Characters are simply triggers for the overwrought action sequences, though between the Edward Scissorhands editing and occasional wobbling background, even those are less than distinct."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,25,"Even in the weak signal that is the January movie season, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage hardly registers."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,25,Diesel has chosen to keep selling stupid to audiences who are inexplicably eager to gobble it up. Damn shame.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,25,xXx: Return of Xander Cage is the movie equivalent of cotton candy: all empty calories. Excessive consumption of this product is likely to give a body the queasies.
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,5.2,44898413,12,"I should put in for worker’s comp for the extensive injuries I sustained watching the insulting, abysmal 3-D action thriller xXx: Return of Xander Cage, which  left me deeply traumatized and suffering from injuries to my eardrums, my eyes, my mind, my soul, my aesthetic sensibility, and my sense of decency."
Everest,7.1,43482270,89,"This is a movie you feel deeply in the pit of your stomach. Sometimes, it literally hurts to watch it."
Everest,7.1,43482270,88,"The mountain, grim and unforgiving, remains the star."
Everest,7.1,43482270,88,This is what filmed spectacle used to look like — a  trip to a place or time most of us could never see.
Everest,7.1,43482270,83,"It lacks the same constant surprises of last year's ""Gravity"" or the visual poetry of ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but Kormákur's movie nonetheless marks the rare fusion of effective craftsmanship with focused storytelling."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"It succeeds wonderfully, offering moviegoers a rare taste of rarified air -- and as compelling an argument as you can make for seeing a movie writ large on the oversized screen of an actual movie theater."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"Like the mountain for which it’s named, Everest is rock solid. It’s big, it’s beautiful, it’s terrifying, and it’s merciless to both its characters and the audience."
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,Kormákur creates such a convincing world – the craft of this film is astonishing – that you’re willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favour of its totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend into a place that’s heaven one moment and hell the very next.
Everest,7.1,43482270,80,"With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't feel like one. And that's a good thing."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There is no tragic hero here; there is no overarching explanation, but a movie that offered either of those would seem pretty pat. Take it or leave, Everest is just there."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"Part IMAX nature documentary and part Hollywood disaster movie, it does an effective job of conveying what it’s like to climb the mountain, the hours and days spent acclimating on practice hikes, and the punishing physical effects that accompany each subsequent change of altitude."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"In this case, character development is neglected in favor of awe-inspiring views. There are times when we feel like we're on the mountain. Unfortunately, our companions - the men and women populating the screen - are never more than half-formed."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,Director Baltasar Kormákur (“2 Guns”) and his cast craft a lean narrative tone that humanizes the action without an excess of gloss.
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There have been plenty of mountaineering documentaries over the last few years, and Everest suffers in comparison to them simply by being a dramatization. As realistic as the effects are (and you can occasionally tell when a shot is green-screened), you're still aware on a gut level that Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were not actually filmed at 29,000 feet above sea level."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"There's only one star in this movie: Everest. Kormákur couldn't shoot higher than base camp, around 14,000 feet, without sickening the actors. But a crew traveled to the top to get footage, while much of the climbing was shot in the Dolomites. No matter. You watch Everest and you believe."
Everest,7.1,43482270,75,"Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, Baltasar Kormakur’s Everest is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained."
Everest,7.1,43482270,70,"Everest may disappoint those looking for a more awe-inspiring film with big vistas and jaw-dropping stunts and acts of surreal heroism. Unlike many mountain-disaster stories, this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again."
Everest,7.1,43482270,70,"Kormakur doesn’t make the mistake of exalting his subjects as extraordinary individuals, or suggesting that they were obeying some sort of noble higher calling. Everest is blunt, businesslike and — as it begins its long march through the death zone — something of an achievement."
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns) essentially made a faux documentary with big stars and better lighting.
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,"When the lights come up, you don’t want to feel like you’ve watched a ­better Cliffhanger. You want to understand the tragedy you’ve just watched. Yes, you want to be entertained, but you also want the icy, whipping wind of reality to sting."
Everest,7.1,43482270,67,"Salvatore Totino's crisp 3D photography and Kormakur's way with a clear, fluid, thrilling action sequence show off the mountain in immensely impressive ways. But the humans involved get short shrift."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,There’s a resemblance here to both the story and the movie adaptation of the story told in “The Perfect Storm.” The characters involved are making a good faith effort—but good faith efforts by humans can only go so far.
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"It feels less like an cautionary adventure movie or the classy Hollywood equivalent of a Reader's Digest ""Drama in Real Life"" and much more like a disaster epic."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"Everest gets several things right, but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain."
Everest,7.1,43482270,63,"A fairly good, extremely grueling movie as far as it goes — tracks the true-life fortunes of a battered group of climbers to the highest place on Earth. Yet somehow it doesn't go far enough."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Though there is heroism as well as love here, because it involves the deaths of people we have come to care about, Everest is finally a sad story, though not always a dramatically involving one."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest is a sprawling mess of a movie, one you feel like could have been great but instead roams all over the place and winds up being just pretty good."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest is visually splendid, though it loses a few points for its murkiness in rendering its main characters as distinct individuals."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"A valiant effort that never quite scales the dizzy emotional heights required, running out of oxygen in the final act. Visually, though, it’s stunning."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Spectacular and well-acted, this suffers from much the same problem as the situation it depicts — too many people on the mountain and too many threads to follow so that affecting individual stories get lost in the snow."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Ultimately, Everest is not concerned with the why, but with the how and it's grimly efficient at building up the drama, helped on by Clarke's wonderful character study, even if the film as a whole never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its subject."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"The hardship of the trek is vividly and stomach-lurchingly portrayed, particularly when the storm sets in, but it never makes the crucial leap from the screen into your bones."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"This is one of those cases where fictionalizing a true event, or at least fusing two or three real people into one composite character, might have resulted in tighter storytelling."
Everest,7.1,43482270,60,"Everest, in short, suffers from the same problem as Everest: overcrowding."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"The feature film Everest provides soaring visuals, but it’s a distant second in terms of storytelling depth and narrative impact."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"Though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, Everest feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"While it’s impossible not to be somewhat caught up in these climbers’ life-or-death struggle, Everest is oddly uninvolving — it depicts a horrific scenario in an underwhelming, distancing way."
Everest,7.1,43482270,50,"Everest is a frustrating movie in many ways – despite some lurches and shocks, it doesn’t quite deliver the edge-of-your-seat thrills that many were hoping for, and all those moderately engaging characters mean that there is no centrally powerful character."
Everest,7.1,43482270,40,"The director was Baltasar Kormákur, a gifted filmmaker from Iceland who shouldn’t be blamed for a case of industrial filmmaking gone wrong — the culprits in elaborate clunkers like this are usually the producers and the studios."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,88,"Ghostbusters is one of those rare movies where the original, fragile comic vision has survived a multimillion-dollar production."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,88,"Ghostbusters is a hoot. It's Murray's picture, and in a triumph of mind over matter, he blows away the film's boring special effects with his one-liners. Spotting a lusty, totally transformed, fire-breathing Slgourney Weaver, whose body has been overtaken by a spirit, Murray walks past her saying, ""That's a new look for you, isn't it?"" Thank you, Bill. And don't get outta here, you knucklehead. We like you in this kind of movie."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,80,"Whoever thought of having evil's final manifestation take the form of a 100-ft. marshmallow deserves the rational mind's eternal gratitude. But praise is due to everyone connected with Ghostbusters for thinking on a grandly comic scale and delivering the goofy goods, neatly timed and perfectly packaged."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,75,"With his deadpan delivery and snide quips, Murray more than holds his own amid the myriad state-of-the-art special effects."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,70,"Although it reunites the comic talents of director Ivan Reitman, writer Harold Ramis and star Bill Murray, the team responsible for the Meatballs phenomenon, their style here is far more laid-back and relaxed. There are still plenty of laughs, but not of the frantic sledgehammer variety."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,63,"Within the top-heavy cast, it’s Murray’s picture, as the popular comedian deadpans, ad libs and does an endearing array of physical schtick."
Ghost Busters,7.8,238632124,60,"However good an idea it may have been to unleash Mr. Murray in an ''Exorcist''-like setting, this film hasn't gotten very far past the idea stage. Its jokes, characters and story line are as wispy as the ghosts themselves, and a good deal less substantial."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,100,"Ryan Gosling in a physical action-comedy? Whoever thought of the idea should be crowned genius of the year. With dynamite timing and uproarious gestures, Gosling mines his diverse abilities and becomes a blast in The Nice Guys."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,91,Half of the best gags in The Nice Guys are of the physical variety. Some of the action scenes escalate into full-on live-action Looney Tunes madness.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,91,"The Nice Guys, which the screenwriter also directed, is the best of Black’s films. It is eccentrically, sometimes broadly funny, with top-notch performances from Crowe and Gosling and a pitch-perfect sense of timing to help smooth over some of the script’s fault lines and blind spots."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,90,"To sum it all up, The Nice Guys is basically “Chinatown” remade by Quentin Tarantino and starring foulmouthed, updated versions of Abbott and Costello, as played by two of the most recognizable male stars of our time."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,90,"The Nice Guys is an ultra-violent burlesque, the sort of cheerfully hostile buddy bash that’s been a staple since the ’80s, only this one is singularly clever about its own triviality, and it offers the scruffy pleasure of seeing two great actors dial down their gravitas with style."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,88,"It’s all delightfully fizzy, bloody fun – even if there’s the teeniest, tiniest hint of sequel ambitions."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,88,Is this a family film? No way. Does it include scenes that some may find painful to watch? You bet. Will you be entertained? Thoroughly.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,83,"It is an easy sit, a big fat slice of smart entertainment. Constantly funny, startlingly violent, and oddly heartfelt, The Nice Guys is a grown-up delight, a perfect antidote to the nonstop barrage of effects spectacle that normally marks the summer movie season."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,83,"The Nice Guys spends nearly two hours treating Crowe and Gosling like a pair of piñatas, beating them mercilessly and unapologetically, and it’s watching them crawl out from underneath and towards some form of redemption that makes the film a genuine smash."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"Quick on its wits and fast with its fists, this is Black firmly back doing what he does best. And nobody out there does it better."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,Should be called ‘The Funny Guys’. The Crowe/Gosling partnership drives Black’s lurid comedy at top speed. Enormously entertaining.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"Black’s general atmosphere of resigned melancholy fits perfectly with The Nice Guys and its portrait of sleazy 1970s Los Angeles, the ideal setting for a filmmaker interested in faded dreams and broken dreamers."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"The porn, the drugs, the smog, the bad haircuts - you can play it for laughs or play it straight. With terrific performances from Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, Black does a little of both. The film is at once a nod to hard-boiled film noir and a send-up of it."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"As summer popcorn-style entertainment, The Nice Guys gets the job done."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,The Nice Guys could well mark the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Black has really thrown the kitchen sink at his latest project and it all works tremendously. Let's hope there's more to come.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,[Black] creates some outrageously contrived and protracted shootouts and one or two good old fashioned action explosions. But he also keeps the dialogue cracking along.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,80,"Think of The Nice Guys as candy noir: all the key ingredients from mysteries such as Chinatown and The Long Goodbye poured into a tall glass, then topped up with sugar syrup, a spritz of club soda, a sprig of mint and an ironic paper parasol."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,77,"While the characters are distinctive and charming, and the dialogue is often pretty funny, The Nice Guys is a large step down on the ambition scale from Kiss Kiss. Having deconstructed his favorite genre so perfectly, Black has a harder time reconstructing it without leaving out some pieces."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Laughter trumps logic here, and the laughs flow freely."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"The cast is perfect, but The Nice Guys could have used one more rewrite or two and another trip to the editing bay to really streamline jokes that don’t work and a plot that gets more cluttered than engaging."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"The film overflows with quips, irony, and physical gags while at the same time relating a noir-tinged story of seedy corruption set in the neon-saturated underbelly of the 1977 Los Angeles porn industry."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Some editing would have made The Nice Guys easier to love — at times it feels as bloated as Crowe’s gut. It’s neither as fast, fresh or as funny as Black’s “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang’’ (2005)."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Like Shane Black's directing debut, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" with Robert Downey, Jr., his The Nice Guys borrows from noir traditions and pulp fiction, throwing a fresh coat of smart-alecky comedy over the whole thing."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,Brews up an enticing murder mystery and gives Shane Black — who directed and co-wrote the script — another hit on-screen pairing.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling’s intelligent and highly moral 12-year-old, deserves a special mention. The character is an unexpected presence that adds dimension to the story, and Rice plays her beautifully."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,The Nice Guys is funny enough when it sticks to its heroes — whether pinned in a tight spot or bickering with each other — that its less-than-compelling intrigues and digressions come as an acceptable trade-off.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"The Nice Guys has a little extra padding that isn’t necessary.... Ah, but Crowe and Gosling save the day."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Gosling and Crowe have a surprisingly fizzy, ferret-and-bull chemistry, and the hedonistic Me Decade setting is groovy.... But the one-liners and shoot-outs feel a bit threadbare, handed down from older, better Shane Black movies."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,"Shane Black's The Nice Guys doesn't want for great exchanges, and even disposable conversations brim with acidic wit."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,75,The Nice Guys delivers enough brilliant physical comedy to smooth over its blunter narrative devices.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,72,"There’s a tipping point at which comedy goes from black to bilious, and that’s a balancing act that The Nice Guys doesn’t always nail. The laughs from this frequently entertaining action comedy get stuck in the throat, keeping this altogether good movie from being a great one."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"The Nice Guys has a nice feel: just slick enough to keep from falling apart, just brutal enough to keep from seeming inconsequential."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,The modest pleasures of The Nice Guys lie not in following the wiggy story twists but in watching Gosling and Crowe mix it up and mess everything up.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"A consistently entertaining, frequently violent and generally slapdash action comedy."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"As an action comedy, R-rated division, The Nice Guys is hard to beat. Black knows how to pace and escalate a fight and a film, and he springs wicked surprises all along — scene after scene dances around trapdoors that the audience falls into."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,70,"Why see this film? Partly because of the leading men, but mainly because of a girl. An Australian actress named Angourie Rice plays March’s daughter, Holly, who is thirteen."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,67,"For a good portion of Black's film, all this mayhem is great fun, since Russell Crowe is obviously funnier than he has ever allowed himself to appear, and Ryan Gosling is funnier than he has already proven. Together they form a deliciously dumb action duo; one brawn, the other sort of has a brain."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,67,"I’m not sure I’ve laughed harder all year than at Gosling in a bathroom stall, accidentally dropping a lit cigarette down his pants leg."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"Is it fun? Parts, yes, and many will get exactly what they wanted from The Nice Guys."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"It should have worked, and it almost does, but Black buries his characters in a sputtering, chaotic story, seeming to realize only sporadically that we aren’t watching this film for the plot and the stunts...but for the byplay between the two main characters. And — who knew? — Crowe and Gosling have comic chemistry to burn."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"For a movie predicated on slapstick forward momentum, we spend an awful lot of time driving backward."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,There are even times when Black seems to be letting Crowe and Gosling make the whole thing up as they go along. Not a bad thing.
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"The characters in The Nice Guys often ask each other if they’re good or bad, a choice the movie doesn’t want to force the audience to make. Instead it settles for making good on the title, occupying the nice, mushy middle — perhaps unfocused and off-balance at times, but conveying a sense of buoyancy that’s as cheerfully contagious as it is freewheeling."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"The Nice Guys never lives up to the promise of its hilarious first 10 minutes, but Crowe and Gosling are good enough to leave you hoping for a sequel."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,63,"The porn industry of the era is as much a part of the movie as the classic cars (re-used in the background, in scene after scene) and the leisure suits. But the zingers, which fall off markedly in the latter third when the energy flags and the plot unravels, always pack a punch."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,60,"Though the plot here may be a confusing, multi-threaded mess (which may in fact be the script’s truest homage to Chandler), it’s occasionally offset by the exuberance with which Black blends splatter and slapstick, and the leeway he grants his two very game leads."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,60,"This is a dumb movie pretending to be smart, even as it wants you to believe the opposite. Still, dumb can be fun."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,60,"The Nice Guys harks back to the 70s golden age of revisionist detective thrillers, but the result feels too knowingly déja vu, rather than bringing a truly fresh angle."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,50,"The violence is cartoonishly garish and the yuks are few. Crowe, looking (deliberately I presume) flabby and somnolent, is more dead than deadpan, and Gosling, who appears at times to be doing a Lou Costello impression, is, to put it mildly, not in his element."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,50,"That the film mostly falls flat has far more to do with the largely unconvincing material rather than with the co-stars, who are more than game for often clownish shenanigans Black and his co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi have concocted for them; in fit and starts, the actors display a buoyant comic rapport."
The Nice Guys,7.4,36261763,0,"This one, by the jarringly untalented writer-director Shane Black, is merely violent, vulgar and stupid."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Despite the very real threat and the personal stakes and the grim weight given to things, director Sam Mendes manages to pay sophisticated, sincere homage to the conventions that define the Bond series while remembering that one of the things that makes the series such an enduring presence is fun."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Skyfall triumphantly reinvents 007 in one of the best Bonds ever. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,The movie's assured direction by Sam Mendes can't be underestimated.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"The third starring the totally captivating cool cucumber Daniel Craig as Agent 007 - is both an elegy and a mission statement. It's also a great, long-lasting jolt of pleasure."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,The Daniel Craig era comes of age with a ballsy Bond that takes brave chances and bold risks. Guess what? Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,100,"Putting the ""intelligence"" in MI6, Skyfall reps a smart, savvy and incredibly satisfying addition to the 007 oeuvre, one that places Judi Dench's M at the center of the action."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,91,"He's 9Mendes) discovered his stride here, a blend of thrills and sabotage and deep-dish emotionalism. The powerful performances by Craig and Dench surely owe a great deal to his indulgences."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,91,"Skyfall doesn't forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"The great success for Mendes and Craig, however, is that while Skyfall obviously has a great fondness for the past, it's not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond's future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"Skyfall is a push-pull between the past and the present, an effort to drag a symbol of maleness as iconic as the Union Jack bulldog on M's desk into a world of approximate gender equality and approximate acceptance of sexual difference. I'm not sure how sustainable that is over the long term; this is a smashing entertainment, but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"We need 007, even after half a century of his ups and downs in various incarnations, to remind us how deeply pleasurable an action thriller can be. The latest addition to the Bond canon goes beyond thrilling into chilling and enthralling, plus a kind of stirring that has nothing to do with martinis."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"The stars and the explosions are backed up by plenty of class - Ralph Fiennes as M's new boss, Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe as a couple of the requisite Bond beauties, and Judi Dench finally given the space to turn M into a full-bodied character."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,90,"Dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor, this beautifully made film will certainly be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal fans worldwide and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner than four years from now."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Skyfall is far and away the best, and the most British of the Daniel Craig-James Bond movies."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,Mendes' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie truly special is the attention he gives his actors.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"With a powerful jolt, 007 feels relevant again, with serious questions about espionage vs. cyber hacking amid the fun."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Ultimately Skyfall is rooted in tradition - and in British soil. A pastoral drive to Bond's boyhood home (in a kind of car that will delight purists) opens the gates to some psychological background, and given the true-love subtext of ""Casino Royale,"" it's not surprising that there's an emotional payoff here."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Best of all, we finally learn something about Bond's origins: The movie takes its title from his ancestral home in Scotland. (A nod to Connery, perhaps?)"
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"This is Bond like you've never seen him, almost Freudian in his vulnerability. And a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"While the protracted third act doesn't kill the two-hour, 23-minute picture, ""Casino Royale"" remains the best of the recent Bonds, with Skyfall just a notch below it."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Skyfall can take its place alongside ""From Russia with Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" as the best Bond can offer."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,Skyfall is one of the best Bonds in the 50-year history of moviedom's most successful franchise.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,88,"Bond's latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series: at once solemn and deeply funny, sexy and sad, self-conscious without all the rib-bruising elbowing."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,85,"Working with the great cinematographer Roger Deakins, Mendes also presents some stunning sequences of beauty in a film where you might not expect such a thing."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,83,"Best of all is the bad guy. Javier Bardem was always a tantalizing choice to play a Bond villain, and his Silva is a terrific creation, and certainly the most memorable villain in the series in decades."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Mendes...lets the quieter moments breathe.... But Mendes is rather good at being loud, too, and his nine times Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins makes the wildly ambitious action sequences the most beautiful in Bond’s 50-year career."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall is a highly distinctive Bond movie. It has some stunning visual touches.... Also, it mostly manages to convince us that there’s something at stake by giving a hint of Bond’s emotional life beyond this story."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall drips in the legacy of Bond, standing tall as an action-packed swansong to Britain's best loved hero of recent years, whilst also showing a great deal of affection for the decades of movies that have come before."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"In Skyfall, Mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air - which really makes him the hero of this saga."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"As Bond sprints from peril to pleasure, Mr. Craig and the other players - including an exceptional, wittily venal Javier Bardem, a sleek Ralph Fiennes and a likable Ben Whishaw - turn out to be the most spectacular of Mr. Mendes's special effects."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall has the feel of both a ceremonial commemoration and a franchise-rebooting celebration, especially in the ways it attempts to too cutely sync up the '60s-era Bond mythos (casual misogyny and all) with the more complicatedly ""Bourne""-inflected recent episodes."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"It's an unusually funny, literate, worked-out script, and Mendes seems hell-bent on making the best Bond since ""Goldfinger"" - or the best, period, given that he exhumes Bond's old Aston Martin only to shoot it cheekily to pieces."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Though a notch below ""Royale,"" Skyfall follows that reboot's lead, making a now 50-year-old icon as cool as when he began."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,80,"Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"Skyfall is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One Skyfall is enough."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it's clear that Skyfall will be both classic and of-the-moment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"With gadgets, girls and globe-trotting held to a minimum, Skyfall, could, for long stretches, be mistaken for just another 21st-century thriller, albeit a well-made and intelligent one."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,Skyfall is certainly the most cultured Bond film to come along in some time. It's also the first of the three Craig endeavors to seriously (and wittily) acknowledge its pedigree.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,75,"Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,70,"While trading on viewers’ familiarity with the series’ venerable fetishes (a cheer rises at the sight of Bond’s old Aston Martin and the sound of Monty Norman’s guitar theme from Dr. No), Skyfall has the life, grandeur and gravity of a satisfying, stand-alone entertainment."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,70,"As much as it's open about its paranoia of the new, Skyfall's fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends. Like this summer's Spider-Man, Batman, and Avengers movies, Skyfall seems to exist primarily to set up the events of subsequent films."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,67,"What's in a name? Lately, less and less. With Daniel Craig's third go at 007, I'm not sure there's much left that distinguishes Bond from Bourne from Batman. They're all slurping from the same soup – think: death-haunted, self-righteous, tight-lipped and -quipped, parkour enthusiast."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,Skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go. It's the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,"The sky is far from falling on the Bond franchise. In fact, it is as good as it has ever been. What's more, Craig is reportedly on board for at least two more outings, so Q had better get to work on those bifocals because 007 is no where near ready for retirement."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,"While director Sam Mendes, aided and abetted by a crack technical team, delivers big-screen action with panache and style, something about this Bond feels a little off."
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,All of which works terrifically well up to a point.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,60,These are truly tedious stakes for an action movie. The franchise isn't worried about world safety. It's fretting over whether to start wearing Depends.
Skyfall,7.8,304360277,50,"In the utterly routine effort Skyfall, we're actually expected to cheer each chord we've heard so many times (here's a martini shaker! Look, it's a Walther PPK! And there's an Aston Martin!) We've been turned into wretched Pavlovian dogs, salivating at the bell instead of the snack. The highlight, by far, is a classic animated credit sequence: Adele, you are the new Shirley Bassey."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"For me, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is the epitome of what a summer movie should be. There’s sufficient spectacle to satisfy the “wow!” factor, some hammy performances by actors in their wheelhouses, a half-dozen solid laughs, and a script that, if not likely to be called “clever” or “smart”, doesn’t demand a frontal lobotomy to be enjoyed."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"Reynolds is playing what amounts to the straight man to Jackson’s bad boy, and the back-and-forth between the two, with his character stewing and steaming in exasperation at the killer’s taunts, gives The Hitman’s Bodyguard its special fizz."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"Salma Hayek stands out in a comic role as the hitman’s impossibly vulgar, assertive wife. It’s also worth noting that there are lots of car chases here, and they actually aren’t boring. That qualifies as a rare achievement."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,75,"It’s an obvious formula, but when the movie sticks to it, it works well enough; Reynolds and Jackson have pretty decent chemistry."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,70,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is not the best movie of the summer, but it is easily its most pleasant surprise. An unapologetically violent and vulgar buddy action comedy, it updates the template set forth by Lethal Weapon and particularly Midnight Run for a new era."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,70,"It’s exactly the movie it promises to be, but more so. It’s wilder, more hilarious, more giddily irresponsible — it’s the hard R action comedy that kids sneaking into it might imagine it’s going to be, minus Seventies- and Eighties-style nudity."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,70,A delightfully ridiculous screwball action comedy.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,65,"The film knows what it is, and lives in its ridiculous skin with an infectious, gleeful attitude. Unfortunately, The Hitman’s Bodyguard also doesn’t know when to say goodbye, and as a result, overstays it’s welcome."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,63,"While no one is going to mistake The Hitman’s Bodyguard for high art, it will please those in the mood for late-summer fun."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,63,"Even by the junk-food standards of summer action comedies, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is overlong, over-violent, and over the top."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"As the word “m#th&rf$ck*r” loses meaning, you can’t help but appreciate a wholly predictable – yet unapologetically confident – action goof that’s far funnier than it should be."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is a movie for anyone who just wants to see Samuel L. Jackson curse, Ryan Reynolds smirk and Salma Hayek kick butt while looking absolutely incredible. Not that there’s anything wrong with that."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is not exactly killing it, but coasts on the charisma of its central stars."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,60,"Hitman's Bodyguard offers more than enough shoot-'em-up to keep multiplex auds munching their popcorn, but sharper talents behind the camera might have made it considerably more enjoyable."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"Director Patrick Hughes' instinct isn't to find dark humor in violence, only to graphically depict it. There's a sadistic edge to The Hitman's Bodyguard that's unbecoming to its comedy."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"It’s not an easy movie to love and it’s not an easy movie to hate either. It’s annoyingly, persistently just okay."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard, which bears the tagline “Get triggered” and is essentially a dumber, tackier ""Midnight Run,"" was destined to be one of those Neanderthalic, faux-merican EuropaCorp action movies, like ""The Transporter"" or ""From Paris With Love"" ­­— except fate fumbled, and the film ended up as a coasting-on-star-power Hollywood programmer directed by The Expendables 3’s Patrick Hughes."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,58,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is strictly an Economy Coach experience, but it’s brainlessly fun enough in a late-’90s Brett Ratner buddy-comedy kind of way."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,55,"The cast seems game, and perhaps they realize it’s on them to elevate the material, so the scenes between Reynolds and Jackson have some genuine snap to them, even though the dialogue and characterization are barely memorable."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,This is Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote territory. How are we to reconcile such images with righteous vengeance wreaked on a genocidal war criminal? Not even a busload of popes could make moral sense of this one.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard would have been much funnier because, on paper, Tom O’Connor’s script was probably a scream. What adds to the unevenness of the whole affair is a propensity for extreme violence that just seems incompatible with what is ostensibly a comedy."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"The combination of the two showcases fun chemistry and antics, although surrounded by a formulaic narrative that action junkies have all seen before."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,Reynolds and Jackson make this summer lunacy go down easy with their banter and bullet-dodging skills. They're the only reason that The Hitman’s Bodyguard doesn't completely sink into the generic quicksand from whence it came.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,The result is passable stupidity leaning hard on its wily leading men. The movie’s also pretty galling in its unceasing brutality for laughs.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"An end-of-summer burst of adrenaline, The Hitman’s Bodyguard promises nothing more and nothing less."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"The tone is playful, to be sure, but it’s hard to see past the collateral damage. Blame it on the times. Make no mistake, all of this could be forgiven if The Hitman’s Bodyguard had enough laughs. It does not."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"An assembly line of ostensibly “hip” gestures and snarky attitude, The Hitman’s Bodyguard wants very badly to be a naughty, R-rated guilty pleasure. Nobody tell its makers that it’s mostly just mildly boring."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,It occupies its genre niche — the exuberantly violent Euro-action movie-star paycheck action comedy — without excessive cynicism or annoying pretension.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,Laugh-out-loud funny? Yes. It’s just a pity that the “more is better” bodycount sours the picture long before its drawn-out ending spoils the punchline.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,50,"By betting everything on the chemistry between its two leads, a tired formula and by-the-numbers action, The Hitman’s Bodyguard misses the mark."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,42,A half-assed action-comedy that lacks the courage to commit to its own premise.
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard is strangely soulless, particularly for a movie that wants to be about murder, morality, and revenge. Those elements are there only to serve up the appearance of a smart film, when The Hitman’s Bodyguard would have been better served by sticking to pure action and stupid humor."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"For an action-comedy, its timing is lousy."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"The leads work hard and there’s an attempt to add fun via cheesy music and Salma Hayek, but hackneyed dynamics, half-baked action sequences and saying “m#th&rf$ck*r” does not a Shane Black make."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,40,"Two characters, who you won’t like, insulting each other for two hours. Give it a miss and rewatch Midnight Run instead."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,38,"There’s nothing and no one to like in The Hitman’s Bodyguard. This is one loud, generic, forgettable late summer action flick."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,38,"Because it so consistently fails to meld its comic sensibilities and love stories with its generic action premise into a seamless whole, The Hitman's Bodyguard sometimes just appears to be parodying the sort of mess it ends up being."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,37,"Despite all the mayhem, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is a surprisingly bland dish."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,30,"The whole film feels slightly grubby and low-res, like it’s been languishing in private mode on the filmmakers’ pre-HD YouTube page since 2008."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,30,"Uncertain whether to be a cheerfully weightless killing spree, an earnest odd-couple comedy or, most hilariously, a straight-faced Eastern European political thriller, Tom O’Connor’s screenplay falls back on shopworn snark and half-baked bromantic attitudes."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,25,"Interspersed with the gore is banter between the leads, who fall into a predictable odd-couple pairing of fussy (Reynolds) and gonzo (Jackson). Their rapport is amusing, but entirely, clumsily incongruous with the thuggish mayhem all around them."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,6.9,75468583,20,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard simply doesn’t put in the effort, with the result that almost every aspect of the film proves wildly irritating, from its central odd couple to the dubious green-screen work that regularly has them pulling nonchalant faces in front of exploding buildings."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,100,This twisted space opera serves up carcasses in six-digit figures but is foremost a sendup for the ages.
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,88,"Jingoistic politics are not proper or prudent in the pluralistic human society of the 1990s. It's much easier to assuage these baser urges by facing a real nonhuman enemy that just wants to kill you. War is gore. You or them. That message is the real strength of ""Starship Troopers,"" although many may find it morally flawed. No matter, this is powerful entertainment that appeals to our most basic instincts."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,83,"The movie is sensationally exciting, but its hey-kids-let s-put-on-a-war! story line plays like Beverly Hills, 90210 recast as a military-recruitment film for the Third Reich."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,80,"A spectacularly gung-ho sci-fi epic that delivers two hours of good, nasty fun."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,75,"Although none of the characters are fleshed out much beyond the comic book level, we nevertheless find our sympathies aligning with them."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,75,"The film's special effects are astonishing, but the most notable and unexpected thing is its tone."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,67,"Wall to wall blood 'n' guts laced with surprisingly keen social satire, much of it targeting the fatuousness of media culture."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,60,This is a movie nasty enough to kill off the major characters twice and still manage to serve up a happy ending.
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,60,"Faithfully represents Heinlein's militarism, his Big Brother state, and a value system in which the highest good is to kill a friend before the Bugs can eat him. The underlying ideas are the most interesting aspect of the film."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"Paul Verhoeven's movie takes more action than ideas from Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 novel, which is just as well, considering the book's goofy suggestion that military veterans should control society from top to bottom."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"The word ""arachnid,"" as it's said so contemptuously in the movie, begins to sound suspiciously like ""Iraqi,"" and indeed, we soon see the elite bugs are hunkered down in their desert fortress, resisting the mighty air assaults of the Federation. The conclusion of our story involves unearthing the chief bug."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"What Ed Neumeier's script provides instead is a cheerfully lobotomized, always watchable experience that has the simple-mindedness of a live-action comic book, with no words spoken that wouldn't be right at home in a funny paper dialogue balloon. Not just one comic book either, but an improbable and delirious combination of ""Weird Science,"" ""Betty and Veronica"" and ""Sgt. Rock and His Howling Commandos."""
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,"A collection of shots and characters designed to circle the globe rather than to say anything much about either the filmmakers or the audience, a triumph of multinational capital at work rather than of people or ideas."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,50,What makes the claptrap in Starship Troopers so flabbergasting is that it's monumentally scaled.
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,40,"Pretty actors, grisly critters, brains sucked out of skulls, buckets of green slime and a plot that is half beach blanket bingo, half Iwo Jima."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,40,"Nothing like the sight of thousands of scuttling, hideous, practically indestructible insects crawling up the sides of a fortress, hellbent on destroying the human race. As they keep coming and coming, theyre the only things in this movie earning your money."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,40,An empty videogame of a movie about interplanetary pest control.
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,30,"In this bizarrely discordant mixture of ultraviolent action footage, bad acting, crisp special effects and futuristic camp, the remnants of Heinlein's rhetoric of military pride stick out like a grimy Marine uniform at a high-toned Hollywood party."
Starship Troopers,7.2,54814377,30,"It's exactly like ""Star Wars"" -- if you subtract a good story, sympathetic characters, intelligence, wit and moral purpose."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,60,"Crispian Mills directs with zip, throwing things together with a breathlessness that largely distracts from the fact that, for a horror-comedy, Slaughterhouse Rulez is neither particularly scary nor especially funny. But it does have an amiable sort of charm."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,Mills stages the B-movie mayhem with gleeful abandon and geysers of blood.
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"The school isn’t specific enough and the horror isn’t weird enough: on both fronts, it’s so broad it could practically be a Norfolk waterway."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,This sloppy horror comedy under delivers on both shocks and laughs.
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"Showing more enthusiasm than aptitude, this earns ‘could do better if it tried’ on its report card — but it’s a strange enough genre mix to be vaguely worth a look."
Slaughterhouse Rulez,5.3,4665,40,"There’s nothing particularly awful about the film (title aside), but it never develops into the “Shaun of the Dead”-like social satire it strains to be."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,80,"There's much mumbo-jumbo about past lives and symbolic tattoos, but who cares when you can gaze at a sight as lovely as a dirigible floating in the night sky?"
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,75,"Both pleasantly old-fashioned and packed with up-to-date computer-generated special effects, the film's constant plot turns, cheeky sensibility and omnipresent action sequences have no trouble attracting our attention and holding on."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,70,"Virtually bursts with visual goodies, and writer-director Stephen Sommers scarcely allows the actors, or the audience, a moment to take a breath during the nonstop action of the final hour."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,70,Sommers is a pure pop Steven Spielberg who's put his deft technical skills in the service of the ultimate rollercoaster movie ride. It's sometimes more exhausting than exciting.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,67,So gleefully abandons any semblance of sanity that it's virtually impossible not to enjoy the sheer breadth of nonsensical fun taking place on screen.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,67,"Action junkies may enjoy this non-stop barrage, which barely pauses for anything but the most rudimentary (albeit complicated) plot exposition."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,"Perfectly enjoyable swashbuckling, eye-catching entertainment."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,"The movie resembles a video game in which each victory whisks you to the next level, with slightly different antagonists and a faster pace."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,Mostly he's (Fraser) trapped in a sequel that's too wrapped up in a desire to top itself.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,63,It's all very impressive without being particularly enthralling.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,60,The actors themselves are more rip roaring and full of spunk than in their first outing.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,60,A few billion 1s and 0s in search of a movie.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,58,"The noisome action sequences of The Mummy Returns are preferable to the quiet times, when the cast is limited to spouting dialogue that is a banal combination of exposition and homily."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,It works its gilded butt off to give you your money's worth.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,Suffers from the bloat common to sequels.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"Everything the first ""Mummy"" was fun for not being. It's loud and chaotic, jammed with effects that don't wow us precisely because they are trying so hard to wow us."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"The mistake of The Mummy Returns is to abandon the characters, and to use the plot only as a clothesline for special effects and action sequences."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,More emphasis on computer-generated gimmickry than on persuasive acting and ideas.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,First and foremost a trial run for a Universal Studios ride.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"You can't see the movie for the footage, so thick is it with digital tricks and furious action."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,This might all have been silly fun -- as it was in the 1999 version -- except for the carelessness of the whole picture.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"Many of the visual effects are stunning, but others are downright cheesy -- especially an attempt to fuse the Rock's head onto a scorpion's body."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,"Fraser is likable enough, albeit never quite convincing as an action hero."
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,50,We have to suffer through two hours of this rancid summer cheese.
The Mummy Returns,6.4,202019785,40,"It punishes rather than entertains; it condescends, it offends, it loathes its audience."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,100,"It's raunchy, outspoken -- and also a smart and agile dissection of art, fame, and the chutzpah of big-budget productions."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,100,The movie is laugh-until-your-stomach-hurts hilarious.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,90,"Tropic Thunder is the funniest movie of the summer--so funny, in fact, that you start laughing before the film itself has begun."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,90,"An imperfect work of genius, a satire of Hollywood excess and vanity that dares to tread territory laden with minefields."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,90,"If you go see Tropic Thunder this weekend, don't be late. The four fake ads that open the movie are perhaps the apex of its considerable comic invention."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,88,"From Downey Jr.'s purposely racist embodiment of African-American anachronisms to Black's scatological humor, everything in Tropic Thunder qualifies as satire, not spoof. It's an important distinction. Pauline Kael once noted that ""unlike satire, spoofing has no serious objectives; it doesn't attack anything that anyone could take seriously; it has no cleansing power."""
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,88,"If you wait through the credits, you get one last joke in the fine print: The actors shot the whole movie in Hawaii, on the fabulously lush island of Kauai. So while they were shooting a story about indulged prima donnas, they were working themselves in one of the most tourist-friendly spots on Earth. You've gotta smile at that."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,88,"When it's all over, you'll probably have the fondest memories of Robert Downey Jr.'s work. It's been a good year for him, this one coming after ""Iron Man."" He's back, big time."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,88,"A knockout of a comedy that keeps you laughing constantly. It's also killer smart, lacing combustible action with explosive gags."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,83,Maybe Stiller just seems stilted because he's the only one here who isn't playing to the rafters.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,80,Stiller manages his movie nicely so that all actors get their share of the comic spotlight. Seldom does an ensemble comedy not contain a single weak character or performance as does this one.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,80,"The history of filmmakers skewering Hollywood's darker excesses is a long and rich one, from Billy Wilder through Robert Altman. With Tropic Thunder, a rude, crude, over-the-top satire about rude, crude, over-the-top action movies, Ben Stiller makes an ambitious and surprisingly effective bid to join those vaunted ranks."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,78,"Instead of entering the jungle to find the heart of darkness, Stiller (the director, co-star, and co-writer of Tropic Thunder) goes in to take aim at the Achilles heel of Hollywood: its utter pomposity and self-importance."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"In the end Tropic Thunder is an expensive goof about an expensive goof, and the results are very impressive and fancy-looking."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"Tropic Thunder understands movies, understands the system in which they are created and, most of all, knows what it takes to make an audience roar with laughter."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"Raunchy, raucous and riotously funny."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,Downey is absurdly funny.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"At its best, Tropic Thunder wrings divine madness from wretched excess."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"Despite its contradictions, the film stayed with me after I left the theater. It's frivolous. But it's also powerfully surreal."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,Basically a mega-budget war movie that makes fun of mega-budget war movies.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"Fairly lightweight, going after targets we can all agree deserve the needle. But there are five, six, seven gags you've never seen before -- real surprises- -- and the film deploys them smartly to keep you laughing and unsteady for the duration."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,Cruise is downright scary. It's the creepiest -- and most entertaining -- performance since his unforgettable appearance in that Scientology video.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,75,"Biting as it tries to be, Tropic Thunder is mostly toothless. Its targets – Hollywood vanity, Hollywood tantrums – are easy hits."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,70,"All over the map, but it's worth enduring the botched gags, formula plotting, and even the racism to marvel at the genius of Robert Downey Jr."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,70,"Those opening trailers are hilarious and devastatingly acute, but the rest of Stiller's film could be more a deconstruction of comedy than a display of it. The brain gets the joke; the ribs are untickled."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,70,There is genuine humor and palpable satiric intent underneath the waves of unnerving bad taste and political incorrectness.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,70,"Although this ­satire of Hollywood inanity isn't the comic ­classic it could have been, Downey's gonzo performance is a must-see."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,70,"To top everything off, Tom Cruise may just have resurrected his career with the role of Les Grossman."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,67,"Some of the writing is very smart, its strain of show-business satire is dead-on and often hilarious, and some of the performances have an insanity and intensity reminiscent of ""Dr. Strangelove."""
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,63,"The frustratingly uneven comedy Tropic Thunder has moments of full-on, bust-a-gut hilarity, along with long stretches where you can hear the crickets chirping in the theater."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,60,"Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,60,"Never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,60,"Like this summer's other slapstick cause célèbre, ""Pineapple Express,"" it's a comedy with as high or higher a body count as the movies it purports to be parodying, and the problem isn't the violence per se but rather the fact that neither movie ever finds a satisfactory balance between tongue-in-cheek and guts-in-hand."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,60,"There are moments of comedy grandeur, but this isn't as consistently funny as you'd hope. Nevertheless, Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus is instantly up there with the comedy greats."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,50,That's the thing about satire: It doesn't play past its expiration date. And everything about Tropic Thunder already feels antiquated.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,50,"A flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,50,Tropic Thunder is an assault in the guise of a comedy – watching it is like getting mugged by a clown.
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,50,"Like a dinner whose hors d'oeuvres are far more satisfying and well-composed than the slightly warmed-over main course. Among them are the inspired mock movie trailers and the fake ad that precede ""Thunder's"" opening credits."
Tropic Thunder,7.0,110515313,50,"The over-all effect is bizarre, daring you to be amused by something both brilliant and bristling with offense; if you sidle out at the end, feeling half guilty at what you just conspired in, then Stiller has trapped you precisely where he wants you."
X2,7.4,214949694,90,"The fantastic and at times deliciously nihilistic world of X2 is fully, believably three-dimensional."
X2,7.4,214949694,90,"A diverting mix of insight and spectacle, human and superhuman. This machine is built for kids, but rarely do words like ""noble,"" ""Hollywood"" and ""rawkin'"" all apply to one movie."
X2,7.4,214949694,89,"An altogether more viscerally engaging film, from its relentless pacing and slam-bang effects work to the fine, appropriately heroic score by John Ottman. That the movie has an obvious gay subtext neither adds nor detracts from the films smashing popcorn appeal."
X2,7.4,214949694,88,"A follow-up with as much artistic integrity, complexity, humor and well-designed action as the original."
X2,7.4,214949694,88,"One of the things that makes this movie such a great rush is that while youre watching it, it seems a good deal more subversive than it really is."
X2,7.4,214949694,88,Captures the feel of a first-rate comic book. It puts the pop back into Pop Art: It blows viewers away with a blast of kinetic energy.
X2,7.4,214949694,83,"It also boosts the punch of the movie that so many of its action scenes evoke the Iraqi War news footage of the past month, and the ""X-Men"" premise -- people persecuted because their difference makes them seem threatening -- carries even more relevancy and weight than it did three years ago."
X2,7.4,214949694,83,X2 sparkles with a lightness of spirit that was missing from ''X-Men.''
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"My chief complaint is that these mutants are a little--well, vanilla. I wish the X-Men had a touch of kinkiness to go with their weird abilities."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"About twice as good as the original...bigger and more ambitious in every respect, from its action and visceral qualities to its themes."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"Funny, reasonably crazy, and unpretentiously faithful to its source."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"Directed with depth, efficiency, and wit by Bryan Singer, the film suffered only from a tendency to seem like a setup for an even bigger movie...Fortunately, bigger usually equals better here, and when it doesn't, it equals just as good."
X2,7.4,214949694,80,"Brisk and involving with a streamlined forward propulsion, it's the kind of superhero movie we want if we have to have superhero movies at all."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"Perhaps in the next generation a mutant will appear named Scribbler, who can write a better screenplay for them."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"As irresistible as movie-theater popcorn - a lavish, reasonably intelligent, well-acted sequel with kick-butt effects that outdoes its predecessor, 2000's ""X-Men,"" in almost every department."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"A summer firecracker. It's also a tribute to outcasts -- teens, gays, minorities, even Dixie Chicks. It's not without thought or feeling, except when its mind gets bent by the gods of box office. Then it's craven and empty."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"A sleek, rousing contraption, a comic-book movie with a sense of playfulness, a welcome streak of humor and just the right touch of gravity."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"Visually, X2 is a sight to behold, with impressive special effects and a dynamic sense of place."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,"As it is, most of X2's action is restricted to the Northeast Corridor, with a climactic face-off in the western Rockies, where, in typical blockbuster fashion, everything goes kablooey and ka-bam."
X2,7.4,214949694,75,This movie lets the characters and tropes borrowed from the original Stan Lee comic live and breathe.
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"As in the first movie, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are trotted out periodically to add a little gravitas."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"Wants to contain multitudes -- high ideals and high tech, the poignant and the silly. Doing so, it becomes a lexicon of modern filmmaking. It could be its own creature: Super-Generico. That's not the worst thing for a movie to be, but it's not quite Marvel-ous either."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"In some ways, X2 is an obvious improvement on its predecessor: It looks more expensive, and its special effects seem to swoop out of nowhere...But ""X-Men"" was undoubtedly the most elegiac comic-book adaptation of the past few years."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,"Mr. Singer and his collaborators grasp that comic books, for all their obligatory fights and explosions, are at bottom about their brave, troubled, impossibly muscled characters."
X2,7.4,214949694,70,The combat visuals that follow are as powerful as those of any war film.
X2,7.4,214949694,67,An engaging spectacle of energy and special effects built around a doomy mood and an ensemble cast vigorously pursuing a story line that isn't nearly as snazzy as the dressing.
X2,7.4,214949694,63,"It's scenic, confidently directed and performed, dutiful, faithful, revelatory, informative, and largely involving. Rarely, however, is it any fun."
X2,7.4,214949694,63,There's a continuing delicacy to [Singer's] direction that gives the audience room to breathe and reason to linger. This may not be a grownup movie but -- unlike the Star Wars franchise or the Batman sequels -- it is a movie that grownups can watch minus the requisite bottle of Excedrin.
X2,7.4,214949694,63,"A substantial improvement over ""X-Men,"" in many ways, especially in visual and specialeffects departments."
X2,7.4,214949694,63,"The longer the movie goes, the more its 133 minutes prove wearing. The story tries to develop a love angle between Jackman and Janssen, but it doesn't begin to take. And the finale is particularly weak."
X2,7.4,214949694,60,The best new addition to the corp is Alan Cummings Nightcrawler.
X2,7.4,214949694,60,"Singer's approach to X2 is very much of the ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school, resulting in a movie that, even at its best -- a thrilling jailbreak scene that's the closest thing in either X movie to a rousing set piece -- seems tame and unmemorable."
X2,7.4,214949694,50,"What the movie needs more than anything is a script. The story is very disappointing and near the end, things start to get weirder and weirder."
X2,7.4,214949694,40,"Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest. Good Lord, what an epic sit. My rear end deserves a medal...I wish I could say it wasn't so, but for most of us, this ""X"" marks a splat."
X2,7.4,214949694,30,"The movie is overplotted, a soulless maze of special effects and relentless action."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,100,"It shows Eastwood, at 84, in his finest directorial effort since the 2008 ""Gran Torino,"" while painting on a much broader canvas. Utterly in command of his epic material, he films the Iraqi action in terse, tense panoramas with little cinematic editorializing, as if he were an old Greek or Hebrew God who is never surprised at man’s ability to kill his fellow men, or to find reasons to do so. Directing 34 films over 44 years, Eastwood has honed his craft to its essentials: make it seem as if the story is telling itself."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,100,"The moral alertness of the film is of the level normally confined, in military pictures, to talky courtroom scenes, yet Eastwood skillfully works dilemmas into propulsive and suspenseful action."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,91,"Unlike many post 9/11 war movies, American Sniper goes easier on the gung ho, with a third act leavened by Chris' depressed denial, his ""hurt locker"" of stored regret. Eastwood is less concerned with action heroism than the consequences of deadly action, how it chips away at the living."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,90,"Finding words for the starring performance is easy. After breaking through as a brilliant comic actor in “The Hangover,” “Silver Linings Playbook” and “American Hustle,” Mr. Cooper turns out to be just as brilliant at intensely dramatic inwardness. In his extraordinarily austere portrayal, Kyle’s silences are eloquent, his impassivity interesting, his inner conflicts implied without a trace of sentimentality."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,90,"American Sniper is at its best when it deals with the assembly-line-of-death relentlessness of combat for Kyle, how it simultaneously consumes him and wears him down, and how, to his wife's distress, it turns the civilian life he returns to between tours of duty into the aberration, not the norm."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"American Sniper isn’t some flag-waving political movie. It’s a powerful, intense portrayal of a man who was hardly the blueprint candidate to become the most prolific sniper in American military history. And yet that’s what happened."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"American Sniper may be the hardest, truest movie ever made about the experience of men in war. Why? Because there’s no glory in it."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,One of the more tough-minded and effective war pictures of post-American-Century American cinema.
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"Eastwood, working from a script that Jason Hall adapted from Kyle's 2012 memoir, fuses the explosive and the sorrowful as only he can. That's why his film takes a piece out of you."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"The movie not only represents the best effort from Eastwood since his Oscar-winning ""Million Dollar Baby"" but the finest acting we have seen thus far from two-time nominee Bradley Cooper."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,88,"Clint Eastwood startlingly grips the audience with his sense of hypnotic silence, which carries suggestions of what might be termed politically apolitical pragmatism."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,83,"Eastwood has directed five war movies and acted in others, and he knows there’s no single truth to convey about combat."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"What we're left with is something sobering but searing, muscular but compassionate."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"It's Cooper's movie, and, although he has been good in pretty much everything we've seen him in, there is a depth to this performance we haven't seen before. It's a tricky balance: As the legend grows, the man diminishes. Cooper and Eastwood do an exceptionally good job of maintaining that."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Cooper’s performance grounds a solid, authentic drama – Eastwood’s best since Letters From Iwo Jima – that is less about one single field of combat than the price of war itself."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Oscar heralds will no doubt dub it ""The Hurt Locker"" for snipers, but the fitting combo of Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper have created a thrilling Iraq war story that manages to both honour the necessities of heroism and ruminate on what heroism might cost a man."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,American Sniper is a superbly subtle critique made by an especially young 84-year-old.
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"The best movies are ever-shifting, intelligent and open-hearted enough to expand alongside an audience. American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s harrowing meditation on war, is built on this foundation of uncommon compassion."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Eastwood has become tauntingly tough-minded: “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” he seems to be saying. And, with the remorselessness of age, he follows Chris Kyle’s rehabilitation and redemption back home, all the way to their heartbreaking and inexplicable end."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"A taut, vivid and sad account of the brief life of the most accomplished marksman in American military annals, American Sniper feels very much like a companion piece—in subject, theme and quality—to The Hurt Locker."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,80,"Just as “The Hurt Locker” found revelatory depths in Jeremy Renner, so American Sniper hinges on Cooper’s restrained yet deeply expressive lead performance, allowing many of the drama’s unspoken implications to be read plainly in the actor’s increasingly war-ravaged face."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Beefed up and twanging like a true cowboy, Cooper nonetheless carries the full weight of his character's achievements - and the questions that come with them - as he tries to find his footing back on Texas soil. If American Sniper fails at being a truly great film, it is no fault of its star."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"While the movie is narrow, it has a deep, melancholic resonance."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall have made as good a film as could be made from the substance of Kyle’s life and career. But greatness was never a possibility, not with a protagonist not all that interesting and with the surrounding circumstances making it impossible to go deeper and risk the movie’s critique of Kyle’s becoming overt."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"The battle scenes are alternately tense and thrilling, especially during one climactic sequence."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Taking potshots at American Sniper is like shooting fish in a barrel. So why should war-weary Americans see it? Because Eastwood remains a masterful action director, and this may be his last hurrah. Because Cooper is one of our best young actors, and he poured a lifetime of craft into stilling his character’s heartbeat."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Expertly shot and choreographed in Eastwood’s clean, unfussy style, the Iraq sequences are taut, harrowing and at times excruciatingly suspenseful, particularly a setpiece in which Kyle faces off against his Iraqi counterpart, a superb sniper who has made it his mission to take down the American sharpshooter."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Clint Eastwood’s second film this year, American Sniper, about the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, is considerably better than his first, “The Jersey Boys.” As a piece of direction, it’s as taut as anything he’s ever done."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"American Sniper's wartime sequences are well-paced and harrowing, reminiscent of those in 2008's ""The Hurt Locker."" Like that film, Sniper can be interpreted either as a patriotic salute or as an incisive anti-war movie. In either case, it's a powerful, moving and tragic tale."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"American Sniper is imperfect and at times a little corny, but also ambivalent and complicated in ways that are uniquely Eastwoodian."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Cooper, to his credit, rarely flinches, never chest-thumps and never loses his cool, even when Kyle is starting to lose his. It’s a masterful interpretation of a man with a lot more on his mind and blood on his hands than he was ever inclined to let on. And it’s a performance worthy of Eastwood himself — 50 years ago."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Another war biopic opening on Christmas day, with tight, two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood, and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,75,"Propulsive battle sequences in which sandstorms make the fog of war quite literal are the ostensible focus of American Sniper, but the real tension comes from our anticipation of how they'll affect the life this sharpshooter is reluctant to return to until he feels he's done everything he possibly can."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,70,"American Sniper is by no stretch a critique of the U.S. involvement in Iraq; Eastwood leaves larger questions of politics and policy entirely outside the frame of his story, an approach not uncommon in modern war films of any political stripe."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,67,"To its credit, the film shows no interest in creating blind heroics but instead uphold the nickname Kyle earned in Iraq: the Legend."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,67,Eastwood wisely trains the camera on Cooper's face and keeps it there — he knows his actor can carry the story’s emotion when other aspects fail it.
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"Eastwood doesn’t care about the legend. Instead, he shows us Kyle much as he saw his targets: with that strange combination of extreme intimacy and extreme remove that a long-range sight confers."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"Less a war movie than a western — the story of a lone gunslinger facing down his nemesis in a dusty, lawless place — it is blunt and effective, though also troubling."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"It’s a cracker­jack piece of filmmaking, a declaration that he’s (Eastwood) not yet ready to be classified as an Old Master, that he can out-Bigelow Kathryn Bigelow. Morally, though, he has regressed from the heights of Letters From Iwo Jima (2006). In more ways than one, the Iraq occupation is seen through the sight of a high-powered rifle. The movie is scandalously blinkered."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,60,"[Clint Eastwood's] gripping, incurious film gives the impression of having not so much been directed as dictated. It stares so fixedly down the rifle sight that it is finally guilty of tunnel vision."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,58,"If the star does his utmost to make a one-dimensional character interesting, his director, Clint Eastwood, adapts Kyle's memoir — a life story rife with moral complexity — by hammering it flat."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,58,"Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a film that evokes complicated emotions. A month after seeing it, you might still be wrestling with whether it's powerful, profound, or propaganda."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,50,"The film is rarely dull; it's one life-and-death sequence after another, and the filmmaking's efficient, crisply delivered. But Eastwood honors his subject without really getting under his skin."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,50,"A lesser filmmaker, and a lesser actor, might have made American Sniper into an unthinking bit of jingoism. Eastwood and Cooper keep finding respectful complexities in Kyle’s story, until the film reveals itself as too simple to have much use for them."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,50,"Overall, American Sniper is a solidly-staged but unexceptional picture, filled with overly familiar dramatic situations and a surprisingly blindered view of the world around its central character."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,40,"Despite a delicate handling of Kyle's internal struggles on home soil, deeper complexity appears to lie just out of frame throughout."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,40,"The humble Kyle onscreen is Kyle with his flaws written out. We're not watching a biopic. We're watching a drama about an idealized soldier, a patriot beyond reproach, which bolsters Kyle's legend while gutting the man."
American Sniper,7.3,350126372,40,"Director Clint Eastwood‘s focus on Kyle is so tight that no other character, including wife Taya (Sienna Miller), comes through as a person, and the scope so narrow that the film engages only superficially with the many moral issues surrounding the Iraq War."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,88,The strength of Burger’s movie is the fact that a non-reader of Roth’s work can enjoy Divergent and not be confused by any aspect of the storyline.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,83,"While Burger, Daughtery and Taylor skimp on the characters’ interior lives, they do make some surprising improvements on the book."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,83,"Woodley, through the delicate power of her acting, does something compelling: She shows you what a prickly, fearful, yet daring personality looks like when it's nestled deep within the kind of modest, bookish girl who shouldn't even like gym class."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,"Director Neil Burger (“Limitless”) has crafted a popcorn flick that’s leaner, more propulsive and more satisfying than the bestseller that inspired it."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,"Divergent is less action-oriented than ""The Hunger Games"" but no less compelling."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,"What about those who haven’t read the book? Divergent, the movie, still offers a smart, spunky, sympathetic heroine, a hunky love interest and a sobering if rather obvious message about the value of being true to oneself rather than mindlessly conforming."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,75,A sequel needs to hit the ground running faster than Divergent does. Find more notes for Woodley's elegantly plain face to express.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,67,The ultimate irony is that a series predicated on diverse individuals rising up against totalitarian regiment falls so completely in lock step with all other post-apocalyptic young-adult franchises.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,67,"Because there’s some genuinely great ideas in the film, and some terrific character work, but it’s given such uneven attention, alternately languished upon and glossed over, that the portrait Burger creates feels complete without, well, making us feel a whole lot else."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,65,"Over-plotty, convoluted, full of unanswered questions and unquestioned assumptions — is a big part of the problem here, but director Neil Burger (“Limitless”) pulls off a neat trick here, in that Divergent is a pretty diverting piece of moviemaking pulled from a not-especially-good story."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,63,"Woodley, though, by virtue of the sheer likability of her presence, keeps you hanging on, keeps you rooting for her."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,63,"Despite two strong lead performances and a welcome dose of female empowerment, this somber tale feels too familiar and formulaic."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"Loyal to the novel, but welcoming enough for newbies, Divergent does a decent if not jawdropping job of bringing its dystopian world to life."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"Smart, tough and a little bit cool, this is an intriguing opening rather than a slam-dunk in its own right, but the cast - and especially Woodley - make it sufficiently diverting to merit a place in the action franchise ranks."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"If you can forget what it’s saying, Divergent is fairly entertaining."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,60,"It's an acceptable, play-it-safe version of the first volume in the hugely popular Veronica Roth-written trilogy."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"At almost 21/2 hours, Divergent is repetitiously brutal and drab, with sets that resemble warehouses and industrial junkyards; the action rarely emerges into the daylight before the climactic gun battle."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Woodley makes Tris easy to root for — only she and Winslet seem to be having any fun — but it's hard to become invested in the convoluted, rambling story. And at two hours and 19 minutes, it rambles for a while."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Divergent is almost good enough to make you forget what a cynical exercise it is on every possible level. The original 2011 young adult novel by Veronica Roth — reasonably engrossing, thoroughly disposable — reads exactly like what it is: an ambitious young author’s attempt to re-write “The Hunger Games” without bringing the lawyers down on her head."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"This society makes no sense except as a metaphor. The social layout of Divergent was supposedly devised so as to maintain peace, but putting people into airtight factions guarantees conflict."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"At 140 minutes, Divergent is too bloated to be consistently exciting, but it’s relatively agile between its many exposition-dumps, at times resembling an actual action movie more than a pro-forma adaptation."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"The bestselling first book in yet another dystopic Young Adult series, Veronica Roth’s Divergent is engrossing enough to devour overnight, and flimsy enough to forget by morning light. Neil Burger’s film adaptation faithfully reproduces the same effect."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,The generic bulk of Divergent hits its marks and moves on.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Divergent is a clumsy, humorless and shamelessly derivative sci-fi thriller set in a generically dystopian future."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,"Divergent, the latest outcast-teen-battles-The-System thriller, is similar enough to “The Hunger Games” that hardcore Katniss fans may dismiss it. But it’s a more streamlined film, with a love story with genuine heat and deaths with genuine pathos."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,50,The film transcends the déjà vu of its borrowed trappings but ironically sacrifices all momentum in favor of a long series of physical tests.
Divergent,6.7,150947895,45,"Director Neil Burger, whose last divergent character was the smart-drugged protagonist of Limitless, allocates more than enough of this overlong movie to details of life and society in future-Chicagoland. But he fails to make any aspect of the premise persuasive."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"The more you scrutinise the society Roth and these screenwriters have created, the more it seems a chintzily self-designed dystopia whose rules and entire infrastructure are pure cardboard."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"How Orwellian is college? Very, if Divergent is to be believed."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"One would be better off experiencing Woodley via her heartbreaking turn in last year's ""The Spectacular Now,"" a drama that actually has more to say about nightmarish cliques and individuality than any lackadaisical slide into future schlock."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"For a film that supposedly celebrates freethinking, there’s a woeful lack of it here."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"Too bad this would-be heir, Divergent, is so unimaginative and bland."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"Ms. Roth’s prose style is good enough and Tris appealing enough that, at least in the book, it’s easy to breeze past the plot holes. It’s harder to ignore those flaws in the movie, partly because the director, Neil Burger (“Limitless”), gives you little to hang onto — beauty, thrills, a visual style."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"It'd be easier to root for lead Tris's (Shailene Woodley, the go-to girl for drab roles with grit) quest to escape her Abnegation roots and those ghastly gray skirts to prove herself a worthy Dauntless if director Burger felt committed to the concept."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"Director Neil Burger struggles to fuse philosophy, awkward romance and brutal action. Even with star Shailene Woodley delivering the requisite toughness and magnetism, the clunky result is almost unrelentingly grim."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,40,"By trying to cram in as many explanatory info dumps as possible, Burger neglects to tend to the elements of the film that could easily make up for any narrative deficiencies: namely, a sense of place and a feeling of urgency."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,38,"Except for Kate Winslet's fearsome turn as a villain, the only terror Divergent roused in me was that the drag-ass thing would never end. Sorry, I'm a Candor."
Divergent,6.7,150947895,20,"In all candor, and with all the amity I can muster, Divergent is as dauntingly dumb as it is dauntingly long."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"We've seen this done before, but seldom so well, or at such a high pitch of energy."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"The film takes off from formula elements-it's yet another variation on ""Die Hard""-but it manipulates those elements so skillfully, with such a canny mixture of delirium and restraint, that I walked out of the picture with the rare sensation that every gaudy thrill had been earned."
Speed,7.2,121248145,100,"The result is clean, delirious, and, yes, speedy—the best big-vehicle-in-peril movie since Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear."""
Speed,7.2,121248145,90,"The movie has two virtues essential to good pop thrillers. First, it plugs uncomplicatedly into lurking anxieties -- in this case the ones we brush aside when we daily surrender ourselves to mass transit in a world where the loonies are everywhere. Second, it is executed with panache and utter conviction."
Speed,7.2,121248145,90,It's an ingenious premise that first-time director Jan De Bont has turned into a tremendously well-executed motion picture.
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"If you're looking for action movie heaven, try Speed, a crackling blend of suspense and fun that gives you the rush of a runaway roller coaster."
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"Acclaimed cinematographer Jan De Bont's directing debut is a mindless, implausible, and thoroughly gripping adventure movie."
Speed,7.2,121248145,88,"This film's dialogue isn't much more literate than a bus schedule, but its plotting is smart and breathless enough to make up for that."
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,There are very few action movies that cut to the chase quite as quickly as Speed and then have the stamina to keep it up for nearly two hours.
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,"First-time helmer Jan De Bont, the ace lenser of most of Paul Verhoeven's films as well as ""Die Hard"" and numerous other large-scale pix, handles the action with great nimbleness and dexterity; film can hardly be faulted for its visual presentation of very complex action."
Speed,7.2,121248145,80,"De Bont knows how to edit a pulse-pounding sequence, he knows how to keep the screen white-hot, and he sure knows how to blow things up real good. What he doesn't know is how to slow down - this premise is perfect for him."
Speed,7.2,121248145,75,"The deft arabesques of cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak juice up the suspense, and if you're not too put off by the sheer ridiculousness of the story you won't be bored."
Speed,7.2,121248145,70,"In a film like this, timing is everything, and everyone from the stunt coordinators to the crew-at-large seems to have gotten it right the first time."
Speed,7.2,121248145,67,"Undeniably, the picture now and again supplies that edge-of-the-seat sensation; yet, by action-adventure standards, Speed is leaden and strangely poky. It never seems to shift into overdrive and let fly."
Speed,7.2,121248145,63,"The plot becomes so overextended, as Reeves and Hopper wage their endless public transportation battle, even the hardest Die-Harders will consider leaping off way before the final stop."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,88,"Set aside your memories of the Conan Doyle stories, save them to savor on a night this winter and enjoy this movie as a high-caliber entertainment."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,83,"Ritchie stages plenty of gunfights and beatdowns to satisfy action fans, pausing to consider the beauty of violence before resuming speed and piling on more."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,80,"A sequel confident in what it's about - bigger, better, funnier, without stretching the joke."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,75,"It's BFF and hetero life partner Dr. Watson who forms the tale's real love triangle with Holmes - escalating the first film's bromantic undercurrent of mutual admiration and ""circumstantial homosexuality"" to overt, unabashed man-love and dangerous attraction - with tantalizingly evil interloper Professor James Moriarty."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,75,"A Game of Shadows is a stronger, better realized movie that builds upon the strengths of the original and jettisons some of the weaknesses."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,70,"Occasionally thrilling, sometimes hilarious and mostly absolute claptrap. Think of it as a lot like drinking a fourth cup of holiday eggnog: Not really a good idea at all, but you might have fun."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,70,"While director Guy Ritchie's excesses and modern concessions -- among them a lot of explosions -- remain intact, the parts of this second ""Sherlock Holmes"" are considerably more rewarding."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,67,"The sequel has all the merits and demerits of its predecessor, only with a less-snarly antagonist, a more thoughtful final showdown and broader Holmes/Watson relationship jokes."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,67,"Yet here, as before, part of the movie's perversely cheeky design is that it throws away its own cleverness."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,63,"This sequel is just as profligate as its 2009 predecessor with explosions, anachronisms and quick cuts. But the dialogue is a little sharper, and Holmes gets a worthy opponent in Professor Moriarty."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"The result ends up like an ""SNL"" skit: knowingly over-the-top but still fun."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"A few shades brighter than its predecessor, and the action bits certainly closer to the full-throttle ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" mode director Guy Ritchie didn't quite capture the first time."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"Ultimately, the best relationship in the movie remains that of Holmes and Watson, which is to say, Downey and Law. Their pairing is what makes the movie; the explosions and bells and whistles Ritchie employs are mere distractions."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"Shadows still functions as a study in superior sequel-itude, building a fine showcase for a reimagined character and the compelling, twitchy dynamo playing him. Should Ritchie ever learn to be elementary instead of epileptically overwrought, he may one day do proper justice to both."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,60,"After quite a few tedious detours and distractions, when the film finally gets down to the business of a climax at a gathering of elite European diplomats in a precariously perched Swiss mountain castle, it becomes not half-bad."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Something of an overlong, overblown, disorganized mess, despite being slightly better than its predecessor."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,Ritchie is simply trying to buy a good movie here -- and forgetting that a little brainpower is also required to complete the job.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"So the sequel, A Game of Shadows, is more of the stupid same. It wouldn't matter so much if Downey and Jude Law, as the bromantic Dr. Watson, didn't look so ready to turn on the cerebral dazzle. Instead, Ritchie treats them like action goons out of his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" basement."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"This movie wants to be a horse but, even measured in box-office millions, it's just another nag."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Virtually every set-up and set-piece in this extravagantly tedious adventure is misleading, or worse, irrelevant."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,Simultaneously brash and dull - hardly a combustible combination.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"There is a plot, but no real intrigue, mystery or suspense, and no inkling of anything at stake beyond a childish and belligerent idea of fun."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"It's an enjoyably demented meta-finale, the rivals showing what they could do if they ever bothered to actually do it."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Fresh inspiration is sparse here; the sequel is less an extension than a remake. Holmes says of one of his lamer disguises, ""It's so overt, it's covert."" And the shadow in this game is the imposing penumbra of Ritchie's very satisfying 2009 film. It's overt and overwhelming."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"I found this sequel more tolerable than Sherlock Holmes (2009), though I'm not sure whether it's actually better or I've just accepted the putrid idea of turning Arthur Conan Doyle's brainy detective into just another quipping action hero."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"The final 30 odd minutes of this revisionist Holmes explodathon are downright thrilling, and it should go without saying but we'll restate it for the record: Downey Jr. inhabits the role of Sherlock Holmes to a near-molecular level."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Ritchie has made a film that's so busy, it starts to become boring."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Director Guy Ritchie is like a Heismann-winning football player cast in a ballet stage-perfectly talented, but wrong for the circumstance."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,50,"Lackluster screenwriting and the absence of actorly communion are breezed past with monotonous banter, as is the fleetingly visible plot."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,42,"What this film really celebrates is crunch-and-thud video-game-style action, not especially well choreographed by director Guy Ritchie."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,40,"The only reason to put yourself through Guy Ritchie's overblown, inelegant Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows is to see Jared Harris, who plays Professor Moriarty, in a chilling low key."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,40,"Though the film features Holmes' fiercest villain and a plot partially cribbed from ""The Final Problem,"" one of Conan Doyle's most beloved stories, the sense of mystery has gone missing. A most heinous crime has taken place. The fun, too, is nowhere in evidence."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,40,"Now the two men are back, along with Irene. But she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,38,"So moron-friendly they should have called it ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Checkers."" The skill level in the script is elementary school, my dear Watson."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,38,"As in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie, there are plenty of pratfalls and bare-knuckle brawls but no sleuthing for us to share."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,25,Certainly Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creations have suffered permanent damage thanks to Ritchie's films.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,25,Wither the rollicking verve and whip-crack humor in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows?
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7.5,186848418,0,There's nothing here but wreckage. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is so ineptly made that the story is advanced solely through announcements.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,"Everybody is good at one thing, they say; for Emmerich, it's destruction."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,This highly entertaining spin on eco-catastrophe could turn the most meteorologically challenged among us into Weather Channel freaks.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,80,"Despite the clunky bits, ""Tomorrow"" still manages to deliver the blockbuster goods."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"Yes, the movie is profoundly silly. What surprised me is that it's also very scary. The special effects are on such an awesome scale that the movie works despite its cornball plotting."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"The spectacle, which is colossal and at times staggering to behold, begins within two minutes of the fade-in and keeps coming until the finish. I thought I'd seen it all. I hadn't."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,75,"Better than his previous films, The Day After Tomorrow plays to Emmerich's strengths, making for a thrill ride that rarely disappoints when it matters."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,70,"A disarmingly pulpy, eye-popping disaster movie during its first half, and an increasingly dull survival melodrama during its second."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,"Several of the special-effects sequences -- a Tokyo hailstorm, a system of tornadoes ripping through L.A. (and tearing up the Hollywood sign), a tidal wave breaking on the East Side and washing through the canyons of Manhattan -- are just dandy."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,"Emmerichs sense of irony has rarely been so pointed, and The Day After Tomorrow, for all its obvious cataclysmic set-pieces and stock characterizations, is nothing if not timely."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,67,Delivers the expected thrills and groans.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"The Day After Tomorrow is filled with bad dialogue, stock peril situations, and sketchy character development, but it's a big enough spectacle that those things don't completely derail the film's capacity to be enjoyed."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"Never mind the cool, convincing effects (and they are cool), The Day After Tomorrow teems with illogical action, improbable coincidences. It's pure escapist fare, a popcorn gobbler."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"This often entertaining movie mixes grand, epic effects and amazing visualizations of catastrophe with a sappy family-in-crisis plot that would look hackneyed in a '60s Disney TV movie."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"Disaster movies, from ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to ""Towering Inferno,"" are impossible to take seriously and ""Day"" is no exception - it's simply a fast-moving pageant of end-of-the-world eye candy."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,I'm not saying that a date with this picture is all pleasure; but it's not all guilt either.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,63,"The real top billing, what audience-goers are obviously shelling out to see, is the computer-generated chaos, and as they should: Digital technology has caught up with our collective imaginations Now More Than Ever."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,60,The really good news is that the disaster money shots are some of the finest ever filmed.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,60,It's the Weather Channel on steroids.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,58,"A decent disaster pic comes down to the handful of colorful individuals who will live (or, depending on the prominence of their billing, die), as it has since the days of chewy disaster meatballs like ''The Towering Inferno'' and ''Earthquake.'' And the heaviest lifting in Emmerich's production falls to Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"What most hurts The Day After Tomorrow is its unfortunate, lecturing tone."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"All this amounts to a badly wasted opportunity, since global warming is a serious issue that deserves thoughtful treatment. So stay home and read a scientific journal instead. This is a disaster movie that lives up to its label."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Packed with digs at Bush-Cheney that even Democrats could find heavy-handed, the movie's lumbering approach reminds us that, OK, Emmerich did ""Independence Day"" -- but also 1998's ""Godzilla,"" which began sinking back into the sea in week two."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"The glacierization of half of the world's inhabited land is contemplated with barely a hint of horror. In fact, it looks kind of cool."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Really bad movies can be fun, and the dialogue here often attains a level of joyful inanity."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,Emmerich does know his way around an action scene -- there's an exciting sequence in which Sam and his buddies run from wolves while looking for meds inside the huge ship that pulls up alongside the library. But he's a master of disaster with no people skills. The characters in The Day After Tomorrow are fantastically stupid.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,50,"Needless to say, the movie fails as a cautionary tale. But it fulfills its summer air-conditioning duties with flippant ease, and its enjoyably cloddish attempts at political relevance add a fascinating layer of incongruity."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"The story is too silly, too woefully underwritten, to stake a claim on seriousness."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,The generally competent B-list actors are hobbled by cliché-ridden dialogue but do their best to react in remotely plausible ways each time the script nails them with some new melodramatic contrivance.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"Despite the fact that The Day After Tomorrow is harnessed to the very real threat of global warming, it's still just a big, dumb movie, another Hollywood entertainment that, instead of tweaking and teasing our brains for fun, leaves us feeling thick and stupid."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"While it's marvelously refreshing to observe Mother Nature obliterating L.A. and New York along with caricatures of ghastly world leaders, almost everything good is in the trailer, save perhaps brief run-ins with malevolent wolves and Ian Holm."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,An exceptionally stupid movie.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,40,"Utterly shatters the illusion with a trite plot, banal dialogue, clunky sentimentality and, worst of all, a sort of narrative arbitrariness."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,"Emmerich now directs entirely in watered-down Spielbergisms, and his storytelling skills, never strong, have gone slack. His talent for stretching a concept that can be described in 10 seconds into a feature-length movie, on the other hand, remains impressive."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,"When it comes to weaving personal stories in and out of the special-effects set pieces, the director has the most colossal antitalent since Ed Wood Jr."
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,The catastrophe is so pulped and exaggerated that uninformed audiences will safely assume that global warming is just a Democratic scare tactic.
The Day After Tomorrow,6.4,186740799,30,Don't ask whether or not you should take The Day After Tomorrow seriously. Don't take it at all.
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,75,"The battle scenes in Rambo III are explosive, conflagratory tableaux that make for wrenching, frequently terrifying viewing. Always at ground zero in the chaos is Rambo - gloriously, inhumanly impervious to fear and danger - whose character is inhabited by Stallone with messianic intensity."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,70,"Rambo's self-important, weight-of-the-world manner and his taste for political posturing would make him genuinely silly were they not counterbalanced by Mr. Stallone's startling, energetic physical presence and the film's stabs at self-mocking humor."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,70,Strays slightly from the formula and therefore loses some of its mindless fun credentials.
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,63,"Though less offensive than its predecessor, Rambo III -- which is dedicated to ""the gallant people of Afghanistan"" -- is still a mindless and uninspired effort."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,50,"Once again, John Rambo guns amok in the name of American democracy, but he packs less dramatic firepower than last time. Rambo III, a poorly paced, much less involving show of guns and machismo, makes you miss ""Rambo II"" (okay, ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"")."
Rambo III,5.8,53715611,40,"As you might expect, the calculations here are on a much less sophisticated level. And by less sophisticated, I mean like counting on fingers."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,83,"There is still Spider-Man's personal turmoil, crises of romance and loyalty, that Webb occasionally holds a few beats too long. Yet the performances ring true, with arresting chemistry where it counts."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,80,One heck of a fun film -- and the most enjoyable and rewarding superhero movie I've seen in a while.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,80,"There are two types of superhero movies: the ones that brood and the ones that swing. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is proudly the latter, filled with high-energy action."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,80,Webb's film is bold and bright and possesses charm in abundance. It swings into the future and carries the audience with it.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,76,"An essential entry in the cinematic canon of Spider-Man, complete with new villains, new questions, and new heartaches."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"Overlong and repetitive as it is, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, at least delivers the goods."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 grows stronger and more engrossing as it unfolds.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"Director Marc Webb and his forces come up with some gorgeous special effects, and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have terrific chemistry, but as is the case with far too many superhero movies, the plot is a bit of an overstuffed mess."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"Aerial sequences are often thrilling. However, interpersonal relations are front and center in this installment."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"It's a Marvel spectacle that manages to deftly balance razzle-dazzle, feel-it-in-your-gut slingshot moments of flight and believable human relationships. There's psychological weight to go with all of the gravity-defying, webslinging weightlessness."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,75,"It has action sequences that will appeal to people looking for the usual pyrotechnics, but the core of the movie - and the source of the audience's interest - is emotion."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,70,"Honestly, one can only wish that Hollywood made movies for non-teenagers and non-comics fans with this much care and reverence. Are superhero movies dying? Well sure, but you and I and the planet may die first."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,70,"The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,70,"Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,67,"By the end of this film, they've done a very good job of setting up the next three or four films in the series, but at the expense of this film telling any sort of cohesive story."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,Less “amazing” than persistent.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,"Lacks the origin-story freshness of its predecessor (even if the inaugural Garfield Spider-Man came only five years after the final installment of the Sam Raimi-directed Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy). It lacks a charismatic central character, too."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,"Easy to watch but hard to pin down, like a creature with eight legs going in different directions."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,63,"So while this Spider-Man is, if anything, more competent than the first film it’s still not one that demands that you stick around after the credits. There’s nothing there."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,The Occasionally Amazing Spider-Man 2 might be a better way to think of the not-always-spectacular but sometimes satisfying Spider-Man sequel.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"Although it fundamentally has many of the same issues as the first film, the strengths are enhanced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and it's certainly a step forward for the franchise. Now, let's give the web-head a villain worthy of his attention."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"An overlong, at times almost plot-free soap opera that introduces a wealth of characters and dips into a wide variety of subplots but never comes together as a story."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of ’60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"Bright, punchy and earnest, Webb’s affable sequel is tough to dislike despite its tonal whiplash and clumsy script, which is redeemed by Garfield, Stone and DeHaan’s powerhouse trio."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,60,"Marc Webb, returning after the last instalment, again shows a better feel for the relationships than he does for juggling all the overlapping story elements."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,58,"Even at a hefty 142 minutes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hasn’t the time for its surfeit of plot, nor for the sprawling ensemble of supporting characters caught in the sticky web Webb weaves."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Bloated and often boring and has absolutely no reason to exist, but that it also hits its marks. No fanboy will pass it up. No studio head will lose his or her job."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"It’s sufficiently giddy at first but eventually grows repetitive and wearying, especially as more and more stuff gets blown up real good."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Despite all the swooping and spinning and swinging in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Garfield looks less like a kid having fun than like an actor entangled in a corporate web that, at least for now, he can’t escape."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking. If I had to pinpoint where this epic goes south, I'd start with the tonal shifts."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"A sequel that, until a late, lamentably foolish turn, balances blockbuster bombast with human-scale drama, child-friendly comedy and gushers of tears."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"It takes something lackluster like The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to remind viewers why movies like ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" are considered superior."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Although handsomely mounted, this latest star in the Marvel Universe is not a leading light. But it probably has enough juice to keep the galaxy spinning until something more original comes along and knocks it out of orbit."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"I'm still not convinced we needed a new Spider-Man series, but at least this installment is interestingly mediocre instead of actively bad."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Folks, I confess: I'm coping with a mild case of arachno-apatha-phobia, defined as the fear of another so-so ""Spider-Man"" sequel."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"There are too many explosions, too many blaring sonic effects, too many break-ups-and-make-ups, too many villains. And not enough heart."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"It is not a sequel, just another retread of tired material in a franchise that is more than ready for the big comic book bonfire. And why the title? There is nothing amazing about it."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"The silver lining: Like its predecessor, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 offers its successor another fresh start, since no one will remember what happened in this movie, either."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"The narrative doesn't want for ambition, but Marc Webb proves unwilling, or incapable, of making this unwieldy story feel like anything but a deluge of backstory."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"The Amazing Spider-Man is more like an old Xerox copy: Greasy, paper-thin, slightly faded, and probably made unnecessarily, but in any case destined to get lost in a pile of things exactly like it."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,50,"Never a disaster but only fitfully inspired, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 doesn't quite end well, but it does end promisingly."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,46,"Ultimately, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is noteworthy for one thing—not waiting until the third or fourth film to achieve the overstuffed, increasingly garish look one associates with less popular (2007’s Spider-Man 3) and outright ridiculed (1997’s Batman and Robin) franchise efforts."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,42,"ASM 2 makes too many of the same mistakes that have brought other superhero movies low (including Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3""). It tries to pack in too many characters and plot lines, for one."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,40,This franchise needs more than a reset. It's ripe for retirement.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,40,"Frantic and rote by turns, mislaying the power of the central love story and piling on the mutant adversaries. For at least this installment, Spider-Man is Amazing no more."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,40,The movie feels not only calculated but tired.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,33,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2, is just good enough to make you painfully aware of all the ways it's not good at all."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,30,"The film, like the original, feels very haphazardly structured, a hotchpotch collection of scenes rather than a unified whole. There's also no tonal consistency, with Webb lurching awkwardly from quippy comedy to brooding drama to high tragedy in short spaces of time, undercutting all three modes as a result."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6.6,202853933,25,"The project as a whole conveys a drab sense of bureaucratic necessity, a ""let's get this over with"" wheeziness."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,100,"This over-the-top, ultraviolent, hyperkinetic action thriller pretty much has it all."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,90,"It takes about an hour after it's over for the heart to slow, the brain to recalibrate, and the nonsensicalness of the thing to sink in."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,83,"Bekmambetov revs it up furiously and unleashes one bit of hyperactive, dazzling invention after another. The result is a throwaway wrapped up in the coolest packaging imaginable, which is acres better than the opposite."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,83,What's bleakly hilarious about the whole movie is that Bekmambetov directs the nonaction scenes just as hyperbolically.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"Like it or not, Wanted pretty much slams you to the back of your chair from the outset and scarcely lets up for the duration."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"Not as dark as its source material, Wanted works exceptionally on its own terms. McAvoy crashes the A-list, Jolie finally gets to be as big a star on screen as she has been in print, and Bekmambetov proves the most exciting action-oriented emigré since John Woo."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,The summer's zazziest action movie.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,80,"For all of its shortcomings, Wanted is a strangely enjoyable flick."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"If you're looking for memorable dialogue and gripping drama, then you better get in line for another flick. But if it's spellbinding special effects and high-wire acts you crave, Wanted should be at the top of your list for big budget thrill rides."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Brutal, sexy, built to thrill and minus a scintilla of redeeming social value, the movie -- based on a series of comic books by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones -- explodes like summer fireworks."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"The way to enjoy this film is to put your logic on hold, along with any higher sensitivities that might be vulnerable and immerse yourself as if in a video game."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Jolie steals the film from nominal star McAvoy in the wild gunfight and dynamically absurd chase that kick Wanted into high gear. Her wicked moves and seductive smirk brand her immediately as a true believer who really, really loves her work."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"His movies are thrilling and ridiculous in equal measure, and I often laughed with incredulous approval as he wreaked havoc."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Best of all, there's a lot of Jolie, barrels blazing. The star's fearlessly sexy hauteur is unique in the biz today. And when she works it in Wanted, she kills, bullets optional."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"There are times when the film is flat-out silly (such as the spinning car assassination), but that's part of the movie's charm. At its worst, Wanted is never boring. At its best, it can be damn close to intoxicating. One word, written without apology, describes it best: fun."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,This is a blockbuster busting out of the block; this is a Hollywood staple served up on a European platter; this is summertime fare with a wintry verve.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,75,"Wanted is like a 12-armed heavy-metal drummer after a case of Red Bull, flailing and thundering through two hours of impossible action."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"In the end, Wanted may be most notable for cementing the connection between superhero movies and the cinematic craze they have temporarily supplanted, torture porn--both genres that, like ""Fight Club,"" address our ambiguous fascination with being powerless and invulnerable at the same time."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"With its pounding, bloody violence, foul-mouthed language and putrid worldview, Wanted isn't comic book-y on a par with ""Iron Man"" or ""The Incredible Hulk."" Rather it's an example of revenge of the nerds at its nastiest and most vulgar."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Before Wanted reaches the end of its wild course, the violence that's been nothing but oppressive becomes genuinely if perversely impressive; the ritual carnage becomes balletic carnage (railroad cars included); the Walter Mitty-esque hero, Wesley, played by James McAvoy becomes a formidable enforcer of summary justice, and Mr. McAvoy, most memorably the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland,"" becomes a certified star."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Wanted's hyperkinetic antics are sometimes weighed down by a surfeit of adolescent misanthropy. But the adrenaline-overdose strategy works for viewers as well as hit men. As long as Bekmambetov keeps the pedal to the metal, you don't notice the rotten scenery outside."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"Fast-moving and bloody, enjoyable even within its unapologetically generic limits. But McAvoy is its real secret weapon: With his X-ray blue eyes and lips that look bitten with anxiety, he has the miraculous ability to fool us into thinking there's really something at stake here."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,70,"A compendium of bedside erotica. I don't know when I've seen a mainstream movie that so explicitly caters to the S&M niche. And the chemistry of the central couple, which seemed destined to bring the movie down, is instead the hottest thing in this effects-laden but ultimately empty film."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,67,Wanted is a queasily unapologetic power fantasy about becoming a better person through violence.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,The thrilling stunts and hyperkinetic action scenes are the undisputed stars of this surprisingly entertaining film.
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Wanted is head-spinning stuff, and it's easy to get caught up in its masterfully manipulated mayhem. Visually, and viscerally, it's pretty awesome."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Slick, stylish and super-violent, but also oddly dull."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,63,"Preposterous, luridly entertaining."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,60,"As nonsense goes, this has a certain gusto and glee, and what dismayed me was that Bekmambetov felt the need to spice it with the addition of coarsely chopped violence."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,60,"There's barely a frame that doesn't look stretched, smashed or otherwise harassed. Imagine ""The Matrix"" on speed, and you're halfway there."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Wanted has one good plot twist in store (though it makes little sense), and its sense of humor about its own silliness keeps the fantasy afloat for a while. But as the body count rises, so does the portentous tone, and the relentlessness of Bekmambetov's overamped style becomes oppressive."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"What are Jolie and Freeman and McAvoy doing here, besides acting cooler than Clive Owen in ""Shoot ’Em Up""? Cashing a check, that's what. Bekmametov may have talent, but the arrested-adolescent ""escapism"" of this picture emits a pretty bad odor."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Things happen in Wanted, but no one cares. You could call that nihilism, but even nihilism requires commitment of a kind and this, by contrast, is a movie built on indifference."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"Either a go-for-broke action movie or a sick, sick movie for a sick, sick public."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,50,"The film hardly aims to be serious entertainment, and, to its credit, it's never uninteresting visually."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,42,"Violence in the movies, no matter how many CGI effects are utilized, can't help but be far more luridly realistic. And, in the case of Wanted, to what end?"
Wanted,6.7,134508551,30,"Big, cruel, stupid actioner."
Wanted,6.7,134508551,20,"With every bit of sliced flesh and every punctured skull I found myself wondering who exactly this movie is for. Its unflinching violence has earned it an R rating, meaning its desired demographic – teenage boys – is out of contention. That raises the question: Are there really adults who want to sit through this kind of mindless, bullying mayhem?"
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,83,Damon's how-to-break-the-law lesson - as ludicrous as anything else in this enjoyably zigzaggy exercise in accumulating peril - grants Neeson the fun of experimenting with an American ex-con accent for his one scene.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,80,"The characters are so vivid that the suspense never lags. Crowe is best in buttoned-down roles like this one, and he holds the husband's fear and resolve in balance."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,75,Offers enough suspense to make it worth the price of admission.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,75,"I didn't buy how The Next Three Days plays out - but I almost bought it, and that's good enough for a thriller."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,75,"The Next Three Days is genre fare - no pretensions, no nonsense."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,75,"The plot is worked out with care, and it takes its time, unapologetically, in a manner that's perfectly suited to thinking adults. The whole enterprise reeks of class."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,75,A detail-oriented thriller that lets us keep up even as it races to a conclusion.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,70,A ponderous but mesmerizing tick-tock thriller.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,70,"In its final half-hour, all the stops are pulled. The movie is still wildly implausible but at least it's hurtling forward. The only thing missing from the proceedings is a windmill for John to tilt at."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,67,"An okay thriller with lots of smart flourishes, The Next Three Days has us hooked early on but never quite gets us in the boat."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,63,"The Next Three Days might have fared a lot better if the screenwriters had stuck to ""The Next Two Days."""
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,63,"The movie is a competent thriller, but maybe could have been more."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,63,"Haggis struggles to make his presence felt over ludicrous thrills, but Crowe is superb and the entertainment factor high."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,60,"Okay, but it lacks conviction."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,60,"Slick, well acted and engaging. It's also morally bankrupt--a film that makes you feel as though you've been taken for a smooth ride by the Hollywood machine and dropped somewhere very nasty."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,60,"The increasingly unlikely escapades culminate in a finale that's as narratively lazy as it is morally questionable, lending further credence to the voices that proclaimed Haggis absurdly overpraised for the 2004 Oscar-winner ""Crash."""
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,58,"Haggis doesn't trust the action to carry his themes across without emphasis, and his movie suffers for it."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,58,"If The Next Three Days were just a little more mindless, it might have been more joyful."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"It plods along dutifully, with the occasional zigzag into contrivance, tidy coincidence and outright preposterousness."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,Far-fetched is fine in most action flicks. And it would work here if Days were a straightforward police story.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"There are some things to admire in the film, based on the French movie ""Pour Elle,"" most of which involve developments that would give too much away."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Haggis finally finds the movie's groove late in the game, and the escape sequence itself is hectic, suspenseful, and enjoyably ridiculous."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Once the second act begins with a title card announcing ""The Last 3 Months""-the amount of time John spends cooking up labyrinthine plans to spring Lara-Haggis's film becomes interminably nonsensical."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Although involving, this remake of a recent French film never reaches the anticipated heights of excitement and suspense."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"The movie was written and directed by Oscar winner Paul Haggis (Crash) and when stripped to its logline, it's pretty ridiculous."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Paul Haggis' middling fourth feature evinces a sometimes pulse-quickening fascination with procedural details, and climaxes with a good dose of swift, suspenseful filmmaking. But what was briskly diverting in the original has been rather laboriously overworked."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,50,"Paul Haggis is positive that withholding information while John makes ""A Beautiful Mind"" flow charts and deals with bad dudes will keep it interesting. Haggis is wrong."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,42,"It's laughably, eye-rollingly absurd."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,40,"About 33 minutes in, I couldn't help but think, if they do another close-up of your watch as it tick, tick, ticks toward another three, I will scream. But honestly, any screaming should be directed at Paul Haggis, who both wrote and directed this mess."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,40,"There is all kinds of potential here, but Mr. Haggis lacks the Hitchcockian sense of mischief to make it blossom."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,40,How you feel about Paul Haggis's new film may depend on your contrivance threshold.
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,40,"You keep waiting for the movie to grow a brain, for that random attractive neighbor (Wilde) to turn out to be a decoy, for Banks herself to become suspect. Nope. The Next Three Days morphs into ""The Fugitive"" on steroids."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,40,"It's damn hard to enjoy a thriller when you don't, won't, can't believe a word of it."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,38,"Speaking of afterthoughts, Olivia Wilde has a bit part as a single mom who unwittingly aids and abets the Brennans in their escape, and Brian Dennehy lurches silently through a number of scenes as John's working-class father. It's jarring to see such big-name actors in such thankless roles."
The Next Three Days,7.4,21148651,38,"Maybe taking a cue from his namesake dish, that much-maligned Scottish pudding concoction made with sheep innards and root vegetables, Haggis presents a mishmash of genres in this redo of Fred Cavayé's 2008 French film ""Pour Elle."""
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,75,"Like its precursor, U.S. Marshals has lots of action and the Jones groupies are likeable. Though the overall picture isn't as fine-tuned or character driven, it still delivers what moviegoers want to see - a fast-paced and entertaining chase."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,70,A movie that knows how to pace its audience. Watching it is like going for a long and satisfying jog.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,70,"Although this film doesn't have the classy quality of The Fugitive, it certainly goes down like an action milkshake. And Jones, one of the most enjoyable actors on the screen, plays himself to the hilt."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,67,"Efficient, uninspired sequel."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,I like that Sheridan's girlfriend works at Starbucks. Snipes plays the part with the kind of high energy that large doses of caffeine would explain.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,"The result is unconvincing and disorganized. Yes, there are some spectacular stunts and slick special effects sequences. Yes, Jones is right on the money, and Snipes makes a sympathetic fugitive. But it's the story that has to pull this train, and its derailment is about as definitive as the train crash in the earlier film."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,Who really wants to go to an escape movie and have to work this hard to figure it out?
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,63,"The action sequences were often nail-biters, the lead characters were well-developed, and the dialogue was intelligent."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"Ironically, the problem may lie in Baird and screenwriter John Pogue's over-eagerness to give us what they think we want."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"It isn't so much a bad action movie as a symptom of the greater problem with most action movies: Audiences tire of sitting through the same fitful, unfulfilling formula, no matter how much terse language and gunfire is tossed in."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,Go see it. But you'll feel cheap in the morning.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"Not so much a sequel to ""The Fugitive"" as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,50,"Generic, uninspired and devoid of suspense."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,"To make the package look fresh, there's a pile of complications."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,"Stuart Baird's new thriller is inferior to the Andrew Davis movie in every respect: script, acting, rhythm and even tech credits."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,"By the time it winds down, U.S. Marshals has all but destroyed itself. It's gone pffft! in the night."
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,Going after one innocent man was bad enough. Going after another constitutes a pattern. This marshal isn't a hero. He's a menace.
U.S. Marshals,6.5,57167405,40,It's impossible to find an iota of aesthetic worth or an ounce of pleasure in this sludge.
Predator,7.8,59735548,100,"Directed by John McTiernan, it’s an ’80s classic full of still-thrilling action, quotable one-liners (“Get to the chopper!” “Stick around!”) and sly digs at Uncle Sam’s penchant for unwinnable jungle wars."
Predator,7.8,59735548,80,"Structurally, Predator is a classic behind-enemy-lines/buddy movies. Nothing much new, just well done."
Predator,7.8,59735548,75,"Moves at a breakneck pace, it has strong and simple characterizations, it has good location photography and terrific special effects, and it supplies what it claims to supply: an effective action movie."
Predator,7.8,59735548,75,It's got thrills and chills and one of the most elegantly conceived monsters in the history of movies.
Predator,7.8,59735548,70,"Crisply stylish and suspenseful, making brilliant use of optical special effects, Predator is one of Schwarzenegger's best."
Predator,7.8,59735548,70,A slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin-plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects.
Predator,7.8,59735548,63,"Despite the off-rhythm styling and suggestions of primeval menace, there's really not much going on here."
Predator,7.8,59735548,50,"Alternately grisly and dull, with few surprises."
Predator,7.8,59735548,50,"Frankly, scarier critters have checked into Roach Motels."
Predator,7.8,59735548,50,"It's arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie. There's no need to do a Mad magazine movie parody of this; it's already on the screen."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"A gargantuan epic, a historical adventure-drama of overwhelming visual grandeur."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"Bloom finally comes into his own as a man here, somberly thoughtful and melancholic. The elfin archer of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the trivial boy-toy of ""Troy"" have been forgotten."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,88,"Better than ""Gladiator"" -- deeper, more thoughtful, more about human motivation and less about action."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,83,"Its concept is gutsy, its script is literate and intelligent, its visuals and cinematic craftsmanship are mouth-dropping, and its vision of the insanity of various religions vying to dominate the real estate of the Holy Land comes through with great power."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable, Ridley Scott's latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,Fulfills the requirements of grand-scale moviemaking while serving as a timely reminder that in the conflict between Christianity and Islam it was the Christians who picked the first fight.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"In its depiction of a fleeting, but nevertheless factual, peace in the Middle East, Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven may seem a more quixotic Hollywood fantasy than all six Star Wars movies lumped together."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Scott and company have gotten so accomplished at re-creating history that the results have a welcome offhanded quality, making them spectacular without seeming to be showing off."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,80,"Full of astonishments, not the least of which are its ideas."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,78,"The story's parallels with the present are sometimes inescapable, as when Saladin's fireballs catapulted at Balian's castle strike an eerie resemblance to the ""shock and awe"" of the U.S.-led coalition's initial assault on Iraq."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Kingdom of Heaven may have problems, but it delivers."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Odd as it is to say, Kingdom of Heaven loses its momentum the more Balian gets religion."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"A rousing, politically correct, Muslim-sympathetic, $140 million take on the Crusades."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,"Scott's cast is like a grand orchestra with various performers filling the roles of instruments: Thewlis a wise, ironic oboe; Neeson a stout cello; Norton a slightly battered flute. As it happens, the piece they're playing is a piano concerto and the keyboard -- that is, Bloom -- isn't big enough to match."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,75,Screenwriter William Monahan has fashioned an intelligent and highly topical epic. Director Ridley Scott has brought it home with banners flying.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,The battle skirmishes here mix sudden violence with slow-motion artistry. The attractive cast can sell an obsession or articulate a conundrum with equal fervor.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,"So, if you want to see this loud but rather ordinary epic, don't expect its tricked-up cultural and theological messages to carry much water. For entertainment value, it's hard to beat the climactic siege of Jerusalem, a Ridley Scott-perfect half-hour that matches anything in ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"" for sheer, bloody, helmet-bashing mayhem."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,Thoughtful and impressively mounted.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,70,"Massoud plays Saladin magnetically, and his arrival only illustrates how many opportunities Kingdom misses. Another, better movie would have made him the focus."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,67,"Scott, working from a script by William Monahan, is so busy balancing our sympathies, making sure no one gets offended, that he has made a pageant of war that would have gotten a thumbs-up from Eleanor Roosevelt."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"But if the film disappoints on an intellectual level, at least it doesn't skimp on pageantry. This is, without question, one of the most beautifully crafted, visually thrilling war pictures ever made -- a painterly spectacle that leaves you looking for Caravaggio's name in the end credits."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"It's hard to say with assurance whether the flaw is in Bloom's performance or in Monahan's politically correct conception of Balian, precociously secular for a Crusader."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"Although Scott seems to be making a point about both parties' ongoing feud for Jerusalem , the movie seems more like a classic Western than a contemporary political allegory."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,"For all its scale, grandeur, historical context and political brass, ""Kingdom"" is no more compelling a period drama than last year's ""Alexander."""
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,63,What sucks the wind out of the movie's sails is the vacuum at its core.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"A frustratingly thin epic. You're left wanting more exposition, more character development, the tidying up of loose ends."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"One imagined that a movie about the Crusades would be gallant and mad; one feared that it might stoke some antiquated prejudice. But who could have dreamed that it would produce this rambling, hollow show about a boy?"
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"The movie does what any self-respecting politician would do: sidestep the issues, soft-pedal mortal costs, talk a fat game, and divert your attention away from history with exercises in spectacle and power."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,A handful of nifty battle scenes and some decent performances aren't quite enough to make Kingdom memorable.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,60,"Fails to rouse any passion. A potentially great subject is frittered away, though this being a Scott movie, there's style to spare."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,Bottom line: Kingdom of Heaven is the most exciting action-adventure yarn so far this year. Just don't expect anything deeper.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Scott's ravishing visual style, characterized by a fetishistic attention to surface detail and unrelenting beauty, can work wonders with big subjects, but this is also a director who needs actors powerful enough to shoulder narrative and emotional extremes."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Dramatically, even a persuasive supporting cast gets Heaven only so far."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"I'd have a lot more respect for Scott if he were actually the virtuoso he pretends to be. ""Gladiator"" had lousy, disjunctive action, and Kingdom of Heaven is even more maladroit."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"Ultimately, despite striving mightily to give everyone a fair shake, the film kindled the ire of conservative Christians and Muslims anyway."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,"A mostly lumbering, occasionally rousing epic that walks a bizarre line between historical fact and Hollywood wishful thinking."
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,50,The movie espouses a kind of Unitarian ecumenical egalitarianism that has about as much to do with medieval times as quantum physics. No one should be offended except -- of course -- those who like movies that excite the mind as well as the pulse.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,40,This is muddled and oppressive storytelling (the script is by William Monahan) dotted with elaborate but weightless battle sequences.
Kingdom of Heaven,7.2,47398413,40,To introduce an archetype like this to western audiences -- as the world weathers culturally and religiously demonizing times -- may have been worth this whole flawed movie. Too bad the story didn't just start with him.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,100,"Furious 7 is so entertaining that you don't notice Dwayne Johnson is missing from action much of the time, only that he kills it when he shows up."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,91,"Plot is unimportant. Family is everything, and Furious 7 is a blast."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,90,"It’s an enormous, steroidal blast, and as much ingenious fun as a blockbuster can be."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,90,"For all the full-throttle dazzle of Furious 7, the best scenes are the quietest ones, in which these characters make observations about love, life, and family that would seem overcooked in any other movie."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,88,"Like Lee Daniels' hit TV drama “Empire,” Furious 7 is stuffed with situations that require go-for-broke absurdity, but even Daniels and his nighttime soap predecessor Aaron Spelling would pause before attempting the level of “get the f—k outta here!” style shenanigans director James Wan and writer Chris Morgan employ."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,88,"Furious 7 is the best F&F by far, two hours of pure pow fueled by dedication and passionate heart."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,83,"Furious 7 is at turns a celebration and a farewell, a film that goes for broke in using its many seemingly forgettable bits of established canon to tie together all of the films and pay its respects."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,83,"The series will doubtless continue on with Diesel, Rodriguez, Johnson, and the rest, but in the meantime, Furious 7 comes to the most conclusive and emotionally satisfying ending since, fittingly, the very first film."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"Furious 7 is an in-your-face assault of awesomeness under the guidance of James Wan, who saves a more lax story by orchestrating a metallic ballet of kick-ass proportions."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,What makes Furious 7 a serious contender for the title of Fast franchise highlight—challenged only by 2011’s Fast Five and its unmatched vault-heist sequence—is the way it embraces the series’ most basic pleasures while amplifying everything tenfold.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"Furious 7 is the fuel-injected fusion of all that is and ever has been good in ""The Fast and the Furious"" saga."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"Furious 7 never even pretends to be a stand-alone movie. This is a fan event through and through, filled with references, inside jokes and a loyalty to continuity that may baffle newcomers."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"If incoming director James Wan (“The Conjuring,” “Saw”) falls the tiniest bit short of what Justin Lin brought to the third, fifth and sixth entries, Furious 7 nonetheless ranks a very successful fourth place overall, with at least one gargantuan set piece that ranks among the series’ finest."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,"A group more bulletproof than The Avengers, causing more mayhem than General Zod. Think Universal doesn’t have a superhero franchise? Think again."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,80,Wan has fashioned a nitro-fuelled thrill-ride that forms a fitting tribute to its blue-eyed bro.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Having, presumably, run out of surfaces on the ground, the mad driving crew of Furious 7 resort to backing their cars off a plane and clutching their steering wheels while driving, er, falling through thin air. Why do they do this? Because it’s fun … to watch, that is."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"It's all dumb, but it's wonderfully, comfortably dumb in just the right way."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Finally, a movie with at least some coherence despite its sadly challenging circumstances."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Viewers who come for the spectacle will get their money's worth. Furious Seven is all about action, with some scenes being more inventive than others."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"It's roughly as realistic as Georges Melies' ""A Trip to the Moon,"" of course. But revisiting our old pals (one of whom is played by an actor who is no longer with us) and watching them survive one unsurvivable collision or plunge after another, continues against the odds to have a walloping charm all its own."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,No one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic. We go for the bananas demolition-derby mayhem. Furious 7 delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an EpiPen.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"Furious 7 offers edge-of-the-seat excitement with outlandish action sequences, inventive stunts, hilarious cartoonish moments and even some touching emotion."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"This is one of the most ridiculous thrillers I’ve ever seen, and yet even with a running time that stretched well beyond two hours, with so many repetitive moments I almost began to wonder if I had missed something and the movie had started again, I have to admit I was entertained by the sheer audacity of the car chases and battle sequences — and there were even some genuinely touching moments."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,75,"The film lays bare that the franchise's most radical asset is also its most conservative: an overriding emphasis on, above all else, the on-screen family."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"Even though Walker is still present, his absence is already felt. It is strange to watch a movie that is this much fun and this sad all at the same time."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"The director, James Wan, sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movie’s real subject is the stunt work, but its stars’ authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"Furious 7 kicks the biggest and hardest, but it’s far from the best. Lin has handed the keys to James Wan, the cunning horror director of ""Saw"" and ""The Conjuring,"" and though the thrill isn’t gone, the finesse is."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"There will no doubt be better movies released in 2015, but Furious 7 is an early favorite to win the prize for most picture."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"It’s joyous, it’s crazy – cars skydive out of aircraft in Azerbaijan, no less  - it’s exhaustively long, and, still, it’s clunkily lovable."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,70,"Furious 7 provides both a satisfying chapter in the movies’ preeminent gearhead soap opera and a tactful, touching memorial to Walker."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,67,"Furious 7 is, to put it succinctly, a rush and a half."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,63,"Yes, the whole movie feels overstuffed and overlong, and the non-action scenes are often dragged down by stilted dialogue. But Furious 7 buzzes with a frenetic energy so contagious, there’s no sense in resisting it."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"While it can feel, at times, a little too scattered (often in terms of plot), this is a praiseworthy venture. Its a film that knows its audience well enough to give them exactly what they demand and deserve after more than a decade of dedication."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"In the wake of Walker’s death, it constitutes a farewell of fitting elegance."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"Furious 7, formulaic or not, knows exactly what kind of movie it is. It is a superhero movie without the tights. It is a comic-book franchise without the radioactive spider bite. It is, plain and simple, an automotive ""Avengers."""
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"The sheer sense of ludicrous, punch-the-air joie de vivre is impossibly infectious."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,There’s something about the franchise’s earnest investment in its characters that’s quite unique. Its longevity is because it functions as much as a soap as an action flick.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,"I’ve always enjoyed the idea of the Fast & Furious films more than their execution, but this feels like the series’ strongest, even though some of its action sequences are so muddled they can barely walk straight."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,60,A film that (whatever massive efforts were required to work around [Paul Walker's] absence) is as stupendously stupid and stupidly diverting as it could have hoped to be had everything gone as planned.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,58,The only grace note in this otherwise determinedly graceless movie is the classy way Walker’s exit is handled.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,58,"There's too much head-butting between human battering rams Diesel and Jason Statham, too many noisy explosions and generic special effects, and not enough car races and chases."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,58,"Cacophonous, gratuitous, and peppered with absolutely outstanding action sequences, Furious 7 finds the franchise at an unwanted crossroads, but it makes such a play for the diehard fans that it leaves everyone else at somewhat of a loss."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,There’s so much happening that the whole gets boring for long stretches throughout.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"The reflection offered in the puckered muscle and polished chrome of Furious 7’s heroes feels like a cheery escapist distortion of a culture that more closely resembles the smashed steel, mangled bone and blood and vomit of a plain ol’ unsexy car wreck."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"If you don’t crave the taste of motor oil on your popcorn, Furious 7 can’t end fast enough."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"Here is a film in which nothing is at stake: Cars crash into each other head-on at high speeds, vehicles sail off cliffs and tumble down rocky mountainsides, people jump out of buildings and fall six stories to the ground, then characters just dust themselves off and continue as if nothing had happened. Even Wile E. Coyote wasn't  this resilient."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,50,"Despite James Wan’s capable direction and very game cast, the whole thing goes increasingly wobbly like a bad axle, until it’s just a tangle of metal and bullets and yelling."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,38,The fun is in shorter supply. And all these gear-jamming chases and wince-inducing explosions cannot hide that this ride has long been on a road to nowhere.
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,30,"If you like a little bit more in a movie — say, characters that are mildly interesting or a plot that's a wee bit logical — stay far away."
Furious Seven,7.2,353007020,25,"The action comes so fast and furious in Furious 7 that, for all the explosions and overturned cars and missiles fired on downtown Los Angeles, it becomes a dull muddle. Here and there, we get the imaginative and outrageous stunts this series is famous for, but mostly the movie plods along, muscling through without much life or spirit."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,75,"What I regret is that all of the expertise lavished on this movie couldn't have been put at the service of a more intelligent story about real firemen, real working conditions, real heroism, and the real craft and art of fire-fighting."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,75,"Fire, as this movie makes clear, is nothing if not photogenic, and Howard has done a beautiful job of conjuring both its danger and its deceptive, primal beauty."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,60,"Not only do the firefighting scenes evoke a feeling of gritty authenticity, but the fire itself really does seem to be alive."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,60,"Visually, [the film] often is exhilarating, but it's shapeless and dragged down by corny, melodramatic characters and situations."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,50,"While Mr. Howard ably maintains a strong forward momentum, Backdraft often feels directionless beneath its overlay of frantic activity. One clear story line would have been worth more than a series of subplots and tangents."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,50,Absolutely marvelous special effects are the salvation and the curse of this movie.
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,40,"Howard, as usual, seems bent on mixing genres to make several movies at once--monster movie, crime movie, coming-of-age movie, and action-adventure movie (among others)--yielding an overall narrative that's not boring but not especially suspenseful or focused either."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,40,"Gregory Widen's script is like a Mad parody played straight, full of ""Scenes We Wouldn't Like to See."""
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,30,"Director Howard is so mesmerized by the flames, he squirts formulaic lighter fluid over everything. A conflagration of hyped-up movie cliches, courtesy of George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic special effects shop, scalds your face."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,30,"The flames sure look real, but everything else in Backdraft, director Ron Howard's inflatable ode to firefighters, seems about as genuine as a plastic log in an electric hearth. Howard's particular type of schmaltz works well enough in small dabs on comic canvases (Splash, Cocoon, even Parenthood), but pumped up to heroic proportions, the sentimentality is just plain silly - in this case, cheap melodrama on a two-hour jag."
Backdraft,6.7,77868585,25,"A noisy, impenetrable and totally nonsensical cogitation on the nature of firefighters and the sizzling ""animal"" they love...We just wish somebody would call 911 for boredom."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"And yet, Goldeneye proves the character's viability as a pop icon: It isn't a great movie, but it's great, preposterous fun."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"There's something a mite pathetic about our culture still clinging to 007, but it's hard to deny that this is one of the most entertaining entries in the Bond cycle, which started with ""Dr. No"" (1962)."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"This is the best bond movie since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,80,"Most crucially, Brosnan makes the grade as 007. He handles the action capably and gets the standard quips out in a commendably straightforward way that's wry but not dismissive."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"This is the first Bond film that is self-aware, that has lost its innocence and the simplicity of its world view, and has some understanding of the absurdity and sadness of its hero."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"Also, there's more action in Goldeneye than in previous 007 entries -- enough to keep a ninety-minute film moving at a frantic pace. Unfortunately, this movie isn't ninety-minutes long -- it's one-hundred thirty, which means that fully one-quarter of Goldeneye is momentum-killing padding."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"When the action is extreme, GoldenEye is supercharged with spectacular, thundering, brain-numbing fun."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,It is both the best-looking James Bond film and the best-looking James Bond.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,75,"The writers get the mix just about right, and first-time Bond director Martin Campbell moves things along fairly briskly."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,70,"New Bond man Brosnan can't be faulted for much. He's always been generically sexy, a sort of programmed cover boy. In this new venture, he's appropriately handsome, British-accented and suave."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,70,"Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein's script promises more fun than it delivers, slowly frittering away its store of jokes and thrills."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,63,"Still, just about everything in Goldeneye, from its rote nuclear-weapon-in-space plot to the recitation of lines that sound like they're being read off stone tablets (''Shaken, not stirred!''), has been served up with a thirdhand generic competence that's more wearying than it is exhilarating."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,60,"Mr. Brosnan, as the best-moussed Bond ever to play baccarat in Monte Carlo, makes the character's latest personality transplant viable (not to mention smashingly photogenic), but the series still suffers the blahs."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,58,Technology has squeezed character to a few measly pixels on the digital screens. Explosions have replaced dramatic climaxes.
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,50,"For devotees of the genre, the bad news is the best news: Bond is back and nothing has changed except the stuntman's canvas - it's bigger than ever, duly pumped up to Schwarzeneggarian standards."
GoldenEye,7.2,106600000,50,"How well do Bond's established conventions survive after a third of a century's hard use, the post-cold war deglamourization of espionage and the arrival of yet another actor in the central role? The short answer is, on wobbly knees."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"If I were nine years old, I would see the monsters-versus-robots adventure Pacific Rim 50 times. Because I'm in my forties and have two kids and two jobs, I'll have to be content with seeing it a couple more times in theaters and re-watching it on video."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"Pacific Rim gives big, dumb and loud an exemplary name and summer audiences something to cheer."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"There’s no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry in this epic battle between massive lizard-like monsters and 25-story-high robots operated by humans."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,100,"At first, watching Pacific Rim feels like rediscovering a favourite childhood cartoon – but del Toro has flooded the project with such affection and artistry that, rather than smiling nostalgically, you find yourself enchanted all over again."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,90,"This is a noisy, chaotic, technology-crazed 21st-century action film, but also one made with tremendous excitement, vigor and heart, along with a myriad of wonderful details."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,90,"Guillermo del Toro is more than a filmmaker, he's a fantasy visionary with an outsized imagination and a fanatical specificity, a creator of out-of-this world universes carefully conceived down to the smallest detail. His particular gifts and passions are on display in the long-awaited Pacific Rim and the results are spectacular."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,88,"Pacific Rim is, hands down, the blockbuster event of the summer — a titanic sci-fi action fantasy that has been invested, against all expectations, with a heart, a brain, and something approximating a soul."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,"Every monster-movie archetype is here, from nerdy scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) to hard-stare leaders (Idris Elba) with a penchant for 11th-hour inspirational speeches. (Watching the former Stringer Bell bellow about “canceling the apocalypse!” is one of those great, giddy pleasures you didn’t know you needed.)"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,"A huge, CGI-heavy popcorner that still feels personal. Come for the epic monster-on-mecha showdowns, stay for the likeable humans."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,It is one of the better dumbass sci-fi action movies to come down the pike in quite some time.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,80,Pacific Rim is big and dumb in a smart way.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Director Guillermo del Toro knows that the charm in the clash of scale - or armor-plated titans isn't necessarily tied to the low budgets and laughable production design of those guilty-pleasure TV shows. And with Pacific Rim, he cracks the code."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Of all this year’s loud, over-long summer action movies that, in various ways, simulate the experience of having a tin bucket placed over your head and being struck repeatedly with a stick, it must be said that Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim is by far the most entertaining."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"What pulls us over the rough spots is the mind meld between del Toro the artist and the child inside him. They both want to astonish us. Geeks everywhere, salute."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Pacific Rim shares much with the Mexican filmmaker's ""Hellboy"" franchise - jokey and comic book-y, full of muscular tableaus with huge squads of people coming and going (and running for their lives)."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Idris Elba exudes the requisite militaristic authority as Raleigh's commanding officer, and Rinko Kikuchi is his determined partner in mecha mayhem."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"There's not a single original moment to be found in Pacific Rim's 130-minute running time, but that doesn't much matter because the familiar beats are conveyed with maximum expertise intended to provide a visceral experience."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"It's closer to the hammering ""Transformers"" aesthetic than expected. Yet the weirdness around the edges saves it from impersonality."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"Yet for all its expensive grandeur, almost too epic even for the vast canvases of IMAX, Pacific Rim is unmistakably a Del Toro creation."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,75,"It is a ridiculously entertaining (and often just plain ridiculous) monster-robot movie that plays like a gigantic version of that “Rock ’Em, Sock ’Em Robots” game from the 1960s, combined with the cheesy wonderfulness (or should it be wonderful cheesiness?) of black-and-white Japanese monster movies from the 1950s."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"Coming out of Pacific Rim I felt energized rather than enervated, excited to describe certain nifty details of the film’s wacked-out imaginary world to friends, maybe even ready to … sit through certain parts again?"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"Pacific Rim, with its carefree blend of silliness and solemnity, is clearly the product of an ingenious and playful pop sensibility."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"It’s not the best movie of the summer, not by a long shot, but if there’s such a thing as smarter dumb fun, this is probably it."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,70,"To kill time between action set-pieces, del Toro has done an above-average job of avoiding tedium via some flavorsome casting, passably interesting plot contrivances and, above all, by maintaining strong forward momentum. Unlike so many similar crash-bang action spectaculars, this one feels lean and muscular rather than bloated or padded; the combat is almost always coherent and dramatically pointed rather than just splashed on the screen for its own sake."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,There’s no denying Pacific Rim is the best film of its kind. It remains to be seen whether the film’s epic clawing and clanking satisfies a pent-up demand equal to its ambitions.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,"In a sense, Pacific Rim winds up being not enough of a Guillermo del Toro movie. It's more like a mash-up of ""Real Steel"" and the ""Transformers"" pictures. Which is a shame, because the idea is undeniably cool."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,67,"Too in love with itself to ever totally go off the rails, Pacific Rim doesn't qualify as the first full-on dud of del Toro's career, but it's hard not to get the sense that something's missing."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"A big, lumbering, rock ’em, sock ’em mash-up of metallic heft and hyperbole, a noisy, overproduced disaster flick that sucks its characters and the audience down a vortex of garish visual effects and risibly cartoonish action. And you know what? It’s not bad!"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"It’s the cinematic equivalent of a kid playing with his toys and smashing action figures together, except del Toro does it with more grace and imagination than most. There are long sequences in this movie that merit that most overused of terms, “awesome.”"
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"The movie is an eyeful, especially in 3-D, but even with humans at the helms of the machines, it’s a hollow exercise in homage."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"Del Toro’s robots have weight and mass, and their epic, Hong Kong-smashing fights with the four and six-legged, clawed and horned monsters are visually coherent, unlike the messy blur of the “Transformers” movies. There’s a light, humorous feel to “Pacific Rim” because the science is silly and logic takes a flying leap."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,63,"Guillermo del Toro doesn't rise above the obligations of staging a film of this sort as a multi-level video game, a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"Pacific Rim never amounts to more than the sum of its setpieces, but it delivers on the promise of its premise."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"If Del Toro is pitching for an audience of 12-year-old boys (and we do mean boys: this is old-school macho), he’s done a bang-up job. Still, there are times when Pacific Rim could be the work of any jobbing Hollywood director – the warmth and idiosyncracy that characterises Del Toro’s finest work, from Pan’s Labyrinth to Hellboy 2, is absent."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,Pacific Rim's wafer-thin psychodrama and plot-generator dialogue provides little for the human component to get their teeth into.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,60,"Del Toro is giving scope to a boyhood lust for mayhem, the multi-million-dollar equivalent of kicking over sandcastles and torturing insects. There is something infectiously juvenile in that."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered — long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"The Kaijus make zombies look like wusses, so at least the fights in this film are battles royal. But overload sets in early, and it all turns into battle boring."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"Pacific Rim made me marvel at the technology of movies, but never the magic of them."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"""Could be worse"" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of Pacific Rim, but my head is still ringing, and hurting, from long stretches of this aliens vs. robots extravaganza that are no better than the worst brain-pounders of the genre."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,You get 45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,50,"All performances remain irrelevant in the face of such expensive, explosive combat and destruction, and there the film excels: You will feel blown back into your seat, starting 40 seconds into the story."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,42,"If your basic movie needs demand a little bit more -- logical premises; interesting, marginally original characters; dialogue that doesn’t reek of throaty, aspirational monologue after monologue -- Pacific Rim will leave you feeling hollow and wanting."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,40,"Although assembled with consummate care and obsessive attention to visual detail, Pacific Rim manages only fitful engagement and little in the way of real wonderment, suspense or terror."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,38,The story's appeal is lost in all the fights between the monsters and robots.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,25,If this is the best we can do in terms of movies - if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences - maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with.
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,25,"An hour and 20 minutes into this two-hour-and-11-minute endurance test, a hungry Kaiju attacks the city of Hong Kong and eats the neon signs of every Cantonese restaurant in Victoria Harbor. It’s sort of worth waiting around for."
Pacific Rim,6.9,101802906,20,"Laudable as its world-building is, the film drags not just in its interminable middle hour, but also during the redundant monster-on-mechawarrior smackdowns."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,63,"Perhaps surprisingly, it's no better or worse that the other superhero movies of 2015."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"At first, it’s fun and shiny, then you’re left with a crumpled mess on the floor."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"It's overstating things to say the stars of Fantastic Four are Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell, because I can't remember the last time four actors appeared less invested in a movie for which they've teamed up."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Apparently Fantastic Four doesn’t want to be another dumb superhero action flick, but try as they might to turn it into a movingly realistic drama, director Josh Trank and a pair of screenwriters never succeed, creating instead a comic book movie that is bizarrely short on humour and action."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"In short, this Josh Trank-directed reboot had a very low hurdle to overcome to become the best FF movie so far. The most fantastical aspect of the movie is that it may not achieve that goal."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"If Fantastic Four is pleasantly different in its introductory segment, once those super powers kick in, the whole film goes into a more standard gear."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Is it a home run? No. But at this point, comic fans are just happy to see Fox play error-free ball with their Marvel adaptations, and Fantastic Four mostly qualifies."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Neither the disaster the fanboy nation seems to be itching to attack nor a significant improvement over the Tim Story movies, Fantastic Four seems doomed to please no one."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,50,"Ultimately, Fox’s stab at reviving one of its inherited Marvel properties feels less like a blockbuster for this age of comics-oriented tentpoles than it does another also-ran — not an embarrassment, but an experiment that didn’t gel."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,49,"Director Josh Trank, whose debut feature “Chronicle” put a smart new spin on superhero tropes, has assembled a quartet of engaging, charismatic performers and stranded them in a miasma of exposition and set-up that sinks the movie."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,42,"It’s shockingly humorless and glacially slow for a film featuring a bendy boy genius, an invisible woman, a human torch, and a talking pile of stones."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"With a weak structure and little chemistry, Fantastic Four proves itself to be a franchise that was better off lost in space."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The impressive young cast -- is mostly wasted. Teller and company, despite their proven talents, are given little of depth to do and forced to spout dialog that ranges from clunky to ridiculous."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The model here isn't adventure pulp. It's dystopian Y.A., junked up with scenes of medical horror too scary for kids and too unpleasant to be enjoyed by anyone."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The film is almost all build-up, though any mounting sense of excitement is dispelled by the monotonously downbeat tone and the cast’s conspicuous lack of chemistry. Nobody looks like they’re having fun, and the gloom is infectious."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"As an origin story that’s all origins and no story, there’s a hollow, stale feeling to this occasionally admirable attempt to Nolanise Marvel’s dysfunctional family."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"Ponderous, pretentious and, most damning of all, just not much fun."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"The cast are some of the most promising actors of their generation, but what chemistry there is between them is swept away by wave after wave of expository dialogue and ludicrous exclamation."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,40,"This reboot of the Marvel superhero franchise is a film of two halves: the first likeable and fun, the second tiresome and loud."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,38,A lightweight and basically unnecessary attempt to once again bring some cinematic life to one of the lesser teams in the Marvel Universe.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,38,"There are no people to watch in Fantastic Four, only collections of character traits and attitudes brought fitfully to life by actors who might've mistakenly thought they were hitching a ride on the superhero movie gravy train by signing up for this misfire."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,33,A superhero film with no power and worse special effects that attempts to rewrite a story that's yet to be told effectively.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,30,"This Fantastic Four, directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,30,A good cast led by Miles Teller gets swallowed up in a narrative that grows progressively more muddled and tedious.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"Ultimately, what Fantastic Four delivers is change for change’s sake, rather than change for the better."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,Fantastic Four is so mediocre that its title seems like a violation of truth in advertising laws.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,This is the Fantastic Four. Maybe someday they'll get to act like it.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"The special effects look cheap, the acting is wooden, and the shouted dialogue consists largely of throwaway action-movie cliches (“Let’s do this”) and B-movie sci-fi jargon (“His bioenergy is off the charts!”)."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,An unfortunate movie that does an embarrassing disservice to the decades-old property and is a frightful waste of all the talent involved.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"From Miles Teller to Kate Mara to Reg E. Cathey, everyone on screen in Fantastic Four speaks in a flat, earnest monotone with a determinedly low-keyed air bordering on openly not giving a rip."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"It adds more grist for the mill to the notion that studios don't hit the big red ""reboot"" button in any other state than a panic."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,It’s a joyless relaunch/re-imaging.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"Fantastic Four is so bereft of all the things we expect from a superhero movie — humor, excitement, adventure, awe — that it plays like a drawn-out pilot episode for an upcoming TV series no one would ever watch again."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,25,"In turning his back on the familiar tropes of blockbuster comic book movies, Trank doesn't have a clear new identity for Fantastic Four to distinguish itself with, and the result is a movie rich with possibilities, but trapped in the basic structure of a superhero movie, with no idea of how to wholly circumvent traditional expectations."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,20,Someone forgot to put anything fantastic into Fantastic Four.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,20,"A sense of heaviness, gloom and complete disappointment settles in during the second half, as the mundane set-up results in no dramatic or sensory dividends whatsoever."
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,11,"Steer clear, Friends of Ol’ Marvel!"
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,0,"Given the level of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, nobody should feel much joy — no anti-tentpole schadenfreude or blockbuster-busting righteousness — to discover that the latest Fantastic Four film is a catastrophe"
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,0,The latest reboot of the Fantastic Four — the cinematic equivalent of malware — is worse than worthless.
Fantastic Four,4.3,56117548,0,"A lousy script, unfocused direction, incoherent editing, shockingly terrible special effects — and, probably, panicked studio executives — have left its four talented stars muddling through a dull superhero origin story with zero payoff."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,65,"Geostorm is as dumb as you think, but more fun than you might expect."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,41,"Just as trying to keep up with every geopolitical crisis on the planet all at once can be overwhelming, trying to track Geostorm’s name-checked concerns and its barely present characters is likely to tax viewers’ attention spans. Horror movies help people process some of our worst fears, but there’s a reason most movies don’t try to address every human fear at the same time."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,"Yes, Geostorm is bad, but it’s not a stinker for the ages."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,We have been sold a false bill of goods.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,"Geostorm is a watery blend of Armageddon and 24, with enough action to entertain on a basic level. It’ll probably be most appealing to scientists looking for a good laugh."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,40,It’s an action movie without an exciting moment. It’s a special effects flick with chintzy visuals. And it’s a Gerard Butler vehicle without enough Gerard to go around.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,38,"Geostorm isn’t “Olympus Has Fallen” or “Gods of Egypt.” It’s no better or worse than any of them, but it gives one little hope for the upcoming “Hunter Killer” or “Den of Thieves” or, for that matter, “Angel Has Fallen,” sequel to “London Has Fallen” which was a sequel to “Olympus Has Fallen.” Butler is in a bad-movie rut."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,38,Geostorm fails to work either as awe-inspiring spectacle or as campy silliness.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,33,"Butler sleepwalks through his thinly written role, and the ostensible tension between the two brothers, flaring up whenever the energy starts to sag, never feels like anything but a bald contrivance."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,30,"When the long-promised global barrage of tornadoes, lightning strikes, tidal waves and extreme temperatures hits in the final half-hour, the special effects are stunning. But the razzle-dazzle arrives too late, and is strangely unmoving."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,"Unfortunately, the gleefully absurd ingenuity of Geostorm stops at its title."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,"Geostorm finds itself in the curious position of simultaneously taking itself too seriously and not enough so. It’s a disaster movie far too ridiculous to generate any real gravitas, but it’s also just glum enough to suck any fun out of watching the beaches of Rio de Janeiro freeze over in an instant."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,"The inconvenient truth about Geostorm is that it’s dumber than a box of asteroid-sized hail. But to take it seriously for just a second, it misses an opportunity to turn idealism about the world coming together to solve its biggest problem and instead turns it into more of cinema’s biggest problem: empty-headed spectacle."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,25,A disastrous disaster movie that is actually quite low on the disasters to its own detriment.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,"Geostorm is so punishingly bad it makes Independence Day: Resurgence look like Last Year at Marienbad. (Or at least its less well-known sequel, Last Year at Marienbad: Resurgence.)"
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,"Geostorm’s disasters are just barrages of drab, anonymous digi-porridge, with a very occasional unhinged flourish thrown in, such as a stadium that’s struck by lightning and immediately explodes."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,"Big, dumb, and boring, it finds the cowriter of Independence Day hoping to start a directing career with the same playbook — but forgetting several rules of the game."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,20,Geostorm uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors.
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,16,"Geostorm is terrible entertainment, but it’s a remarkably effective window into Donald Trump’s soul."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,11,"Not a single character or the jeopardy that they find themselves in – end of the entire human race and all – is likable, canine-in-peril excluded."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,10,"Even though no movie that lends itself to individually tailored special effects should be a royal snoozefest, it’s 2017 and everything is awful, and so, too, is Geostorm, a disaster movie without a disaster and an apocalypse flick lacking the apocalypse."
Geostorm,5.3,33700160,10,"The only thing more reliable than bad weather is bad movies, and in that respect, Geostorm is right on forecast."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,75,"Death Wish is easily the second best “Death Wish” movie ever made, and not a distant second."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,Death Wish is a classier version of what you can find on cable in the wee hours — it’s not worth seeing in the theater — but it’s worth pausing over its politics of guns.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The one light at the end of this long, slogged-through tunnel is, surprisingly, Willis."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The 2018 Death Wish has been developed with a specific audience in mind – those who enjoy these kinds of thoughtlessly violent outings. The direction is workmanlike, although without the flourishes that have added some visual razzle-dazzle to similar orgies of brutality like ""John Wick"" and its sequel."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The film, much like Willis' performance, never flatlines, but it never delivers the thrills you expect from this type of genre piece."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"Again and again, Death Wish feels anything but real."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"Roth and Carnahan’s motivations here remain murky and Death Wish never justifies its existence. Divorced of context, it’s like sauce and tomato without the burger."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"The film’s best stability through all of these shifts is Willis who, while he could do a role like this in his sleep (and has), commands the screen and reminds us why he became an above-the-marquee star in the first place."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,Eli Roth’s Death Wish isn’t a bad movie as far as super-violent exploitation flicks go. But it is a deeply problematic one. And that problem boils down to this: It’s the absolute wrong movie at the absolute wrong time.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"Although he races through the occasional blasts of gritty action, Roth slows things down whenever Paul corners one of the people who killed his wife, the director sinking his teeth into long torture sequences or terse dialogue scenes that are punctuated with shocking flashes of gore."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,50,"A wishy-washy exploitation movie, which doesn’t show any real verve until the climax."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"Sadly, Donald Trump hasn’t quite found his Leni Riefenstahl: this is a film too embarrassed to be what it is. And shorn of capes and costumes, vigilantism is pretty ugly. Though Roth’s gift for the gruesome gives it a small voyeuristic appeal."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"This is a standard vigilante/revenge fantasy too plodding to deliver the base genre goodies, and too simplistic to work as a character study on how a sudden life of violence can irredeemably disrupt an average citizen’s psyche, the way the original film at least half-heartedly attempted to do."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"Quite simply, it’s impossible to “enjoy” a film that makes you feel even worse about the society we live in – especially when it’s so gobsmackingly unaware itself."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,All the new Death Wish is truly committed to is getting a rise out of the audience. It’s a first-person-shooter fantasy. The film’s only real view of justice is that it’s a blast.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,40,"But the real problem is that the picture feels padded. There are endless, and pointless, scenes of radio hosts debating the vigilante violence. And the wildly mismatched shoot-outs — every criminal Kersey goes up against is slow, stupid and a lousy shot — waters down the thrills."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,38,"Preying on a hurting city might be forgiven if the movie was any good. But Willis, who was once a formidable action star, is performing “Die Hard With an Ambien” as he exhibits zero emotion and mutters under his breath like an accountant who’s upset with his boss."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,38,"The new Death Wish is a vigilante film that's also about vigilante film cliches, when it remembers to think about such things, which is only occasionally. Most of its attempts to subvert or freshen up familiar elements aren't well developed, and they're certainly never strong enough to counter the bloodlust and gun worship that's invariably going to power this kind of project."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,33,"Whether uncritically brought over in remake translation or genuinely reaffirmed, the movie’s fucked-up politics poison the fun. By the end, which creates an unmistakably symmetrical arc for Paul, Death Wish has all but devolved into a scare-tactics advertisement for locked-and-loaded home protection."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"Eli Roth and screenwriter Joe Carnahan could have done the same thing, manifesting the rages and fears that afflict the country we live in right now. Instead they offer a cheap and dishonest Death Wish that (references to social media notwithstanding) is interchangeable with get-tough knockoffs that have flooded cinemas for decades."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"Directed by Eli Roth with the same knowing smirk that has informed his previous exercises in self-satisfied bloodletting (""Cabin Fever,"" ""The Green Inferno,"" the ""Hostel"" movies), the movie is a slick, straightforward revenge thriller as well as a sham provocation, pandering shamelessly to the viewer's bloodlust while trying to pass as self-aware satire. Your time, to say nothing of your outrage, is much better spent elsewhere."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"Death Wish takes the serious topic of vigilante violence and reduces it to melodramatic hero worship, and it’s not even particularly good at that. The action is forgettable and the plot barely holds together."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,30,"As soon as Willis deploys his trademark smirk, and the comfortable vengeance of tracking down his wife’s killers while avoiding detection takes over, it just becomes a million other B-movies about lowlifes getting what they deserve."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,25,"Bruce Willis, looking decrepit and acting like he gave his last damn a dozen years ago, stars in what plays like an old man’s movie for angry, emasculated and frightened old men."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,25,"For a while, director Roth plays this stuff relatively straight, and Willis periodically reminds us he can act (the grieving Kersey cries a fair bit here)."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,25,There’s something distinctly odious about a storyteller exploiting both a city’s tragic reality and a country’s debate about firearms to make a film that thrives on violence.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,"A pound-store Tarantino with the sadism dialled up and the wit switched off, Roth has the very basics of a stomach-clenching suspense sequence down pat. It’s just that the film never provides any rationale for why you’d want to submit to it."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,"The new Death Wish is unlikely to spark similar controversy, simply because the filmmaking is not as compelling as in the original film."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,An imbecilic misfire.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,20,"This could be satire, but Roth and screenwriter Joe Carnahan refuse to take a stance. Ironically, a film about a guy with guts doesn’t have any itself."
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,12,The only thing stopping Roth's film from being an irredeemable zero-star disaster is its introduction of a dramatic principle that I'm nicknaming Chekhov's Gun Cabinet – but that's hardly justice for such a recklessly criminal cinematic act as Death Wish.
Death Wish,6.4,34017028,0,"At a time when Americans are constantly bombarded with reports of unpunished police brutality, the film suggests that the true problem with justice in our country is that law enforcement isn't violent enough."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"Korean-American actor and former model Yune (who played a similar role in ""Die Another Day,"" the last Pierce Brosnan James Bond film) makes a colourful villain – handsome and insufferably assured, and also an unchivalrous sadist who kicks around the Secretary of Defense (Melissa Leo in a pageboy wig) as though she’s a hacky sack."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"Although the film's real-world credibility is shaky, it works on its own terms."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"It's that wonderful, totally unambitious yet satisfying thing, a really good movie."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,75,"While Olympus Has Fallen breaks no major new ground in the political thriller genre, Fuqua has directed a sharp, very taut adventure that keeps you engrossed from start to finish."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,67,"The action is the real star here, and it’s all good enough. It isn’t great – the aerial special effects are distractingly cheap – but at least there’s lots of it on display."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,67,"Melissa Leo has some standout scenes as the secretary of defense, who gets pretty well beaten up for defying her captors, but others, such as Angela Bassett and Morgan Freeman, have little to do but bite their lips and look tense from the confines of their command posts."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,63,Any semblance of seriousness and verisimilitude suggested by the marketing campaign is quickly forgotten once director Antoine Fuqua's enjoyably tacky Die Hard-on-the-Potomac gets under way.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,63,The film spends its first act establishing a flimsy emotional groundwork before gleefully taking a sledgehammer to it just seconds into act two.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,"The thrills and the effects are cheap, but this is in hard-driving, good-humoured command of its own silliness."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,A deep supporting cast brings its A-game to the ridiculous dialogue.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,"Perhaps every generation gets the movie stars it deserves. “Olympus” has quite a bit to say about the current state of our country. Intentions aside, not all of it is entirely flattering."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,Generates a fair amount of tension and produces the kind of nationalistic outrage that rock-ribbed Americans will feel in their guts.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,60,"A Red Dawn for the Tea Party era, Olympus Has Fallen is pretty ridiculously entertaining—or at least entertainingly ridiculous—for long stretches, dulled only by the realization that there are many parts of the country where this will play as less than total farce."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,Olympus Has Fallen at least possesses the frisson of timeliness amid otherwise hoary action-movie cliches.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"This unapologetic B-movie at least keeps the action rolling, and the time goes by quickly. To put it another way, I’d rather see Gerard Butler stab a terrorist in the neck than flirt with Katherine Heigl."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"This is for those who like their political thrillers far-fetched, far-reaching and filled with pretty people."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"A North Korean terrorist may be responsible for taking the president hostage, but it’s Bulgarian-made CGI that does the most damage in Antoine Fuqua’s intense, ugly, White-House-under-siege actioner Olympus Has Fallen."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"For all the bursts of blood, the gunplay and execution-style head-shots that punctuate scores of deaths, it’s hard to see Olympus Has Fallen (Secret Service code) as much more than another movie manifestation of a first-person shooter video game."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"Butler serves the cause well, considering. Think that cause is a thankless one? Shhh, don’t tell Secret Service agent Channing Tatum or president Jamie Foxx, headed your way in June with, yes, “White House Down.”"
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,50,"The countdown-to-Armageddon structure generates almost no tension, but Olympus Has Fallen does have lots of squalidly bloody hand-to-hand action, all of which is so pulpy and standardthat the film actually makes you grateful for the presence of Gerard Butler, gnashing his teeth in the Bruce Willis role."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,42,"The movie is so apolitical; there could have been a nice slant to the movie, about how both sides of the aisle could get together to kick out these Korean terrorists. Instead, it remains totally void."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,40,"Part of the weirdness of this film lies in the fact that the tense North Korean situation in the real world gives it no realism or satirical edge, or prophetic authority of any kind."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,40,"The movie isn’t a desecration, but it’s action filmmaking, not America, that needs to be reborn."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,40,"If you’re just going to rip off the action movies of yore, why not rip off more of the good stuff?"
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,35,Feels from start to finish like a throwback to the action cinema and military thrillers of decades past.
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,30,"Olympus Has Fallen is a disgusting piece of work, but it certainly hits its marks — it makes you sick with suspense."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,25,"Nearly everything that happens in Olympus Has Fallen is ludicrous, yet because the fate of the president and the nation hangs in the balance, the crisis is treated with the gravitas of Paul Scofield at the West End."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,20,"It may be too much to ask for anything more, but, on the other hand, if you’re going to go to the trouble of pretending to blow up the White House, you might also want to pretend that something was at stake."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,10,"[Antoine Fuqua] gives in to terrible instincts here, flirting with overwrought patriotism, one too many laugh lines amid numerous characters being shot in the head, and a general chaos-inspired editing technique all too rampant in today's action cinema."
Olympus Has Fallen,6.5,98925640,0,"Olympus Has Fallen is no fun at all. To the contrary, it soon grows tedious, odious and oppressive."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,80,"There was no way, no matter how much Spielberg flounce was imbued in this sprightly sequel, that it was going to be as good as the original. It isn't. By a long shot. But even two thirds of the way toward Jurassic Park is about a third better than your average buster of blocks."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,78,"The Lost World (unlike Spielberg's original film) leaps head first into the action, rushing, it seems, to get the film's real stars -- the dinosaurs -- to the screen as quickly as possible, and it does so with considerable verve."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,75,"Much of this movie seems like a retread of Jurassic Park (with a little King Kong thrown in at the end), not because director Steven Spielberg is intentionally copying himself, but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,"The story (adapted by Spielberg and David Koepp from Michael Chrichton's ""Lost World"") isn't much better than ""Jurassic Park."" And the predictability factor is high."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,"For the first half-hour, the movie is pretty crummy. Even Spielberg appears bored with the script's lame setup, its quick evocation of the first movie and its wan establishment of human villains and heroes. Like any 50-year-old adolescent, he can't wait for the dinosaurs. And when he gets to them, the movie ceases to bear any relationship to conceits of narrative and becomes a sheer adrenalin spike to the brain stem."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,It's not just that we've been there before but also that Steven Spielberg and his associates simply haven't been able to imagine as many flat-out scary moments this time around.
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,70,"The Lost World is a smoother, scarier ride than its predecessor, with twice as many dinosaurs twice as well designed eating twice as many people...But he's not particularly playful with his terrors here, and that's a disappointment coming from a filmmaker who can mix scares and laughs the way no one else ever has."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"Where the original film was a cut-and-dried Pop-Art-flavored allegory pitting scientific hubris against the unpredictable, ungovernable forces of nature, the sequel is an all-stops-pulled, edge-of-your-seat adventure film whose messages are not so neatly packaged."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"It would be imprecise to say that the thrill is gone, because The Lost World recovers from its turgid opening and comes to life, or does so in spasms."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"Although the digital dinos look great, especially the clumsy stegosaurs, Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp have failed to absorb the single most important lesson from the movies they've looted: If your people aren't interesting, at least make your monsters memorable."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"For all the enhanced ingenuity of the special effects in The Lost World, the element of surprise and originality (the idea of cloning dinosaurs from fossilized DNA) is no longer present. And screenwriter David Koepp (the movie is very loosely based on Michael Crichton's sequel to his novel ""Jurassic Park"") has come up with a pretty conventional story line."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"David Koepp's script, from the Michael Crichton novel, is schematic and largely predictable. There's an obvious threat and not too many ways to quell it. Underneath the technical virtuosity is a standard chase film, and director Steven Spielberg does little to elevate it dramatically."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,60,"It's technologically more advanced, far more thrilling and there's infinitely more dinos per minute."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"Steven Spielberg's blockbuster whips up superficial sorts of excitement, and unlike the original ""Jurassic Park,"" the picture looks tacky around the edges."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"Steven Spielberg, a gifted filmmaker, should have reimagined the material, should have seen it through the eyes of someone looking at dinosaurs, rather than through the eyes of someone looking at a box-office sequel."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"The biggest sequel of the summer has more dinosaurs, better special effects and more action than the original... But the inspiration is gone, and with it most of the fun."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,50,"The thrill is most certainly not in the script by David Koepp, written from Michael Crichton's novel....Most of the writing is the blandest sort of twaddle, jokes you can practically recite along with actors."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,6.5,229086679,40,Among the movie's many flaws are lackluster cinematography and leaden sound design. The Lost World also includes irritating little missteps in the plot.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,88,"A movie likely to rally huge audiences who want to take another roller coaster ride. And though it may disappoint a few of them, it's also a film that gives you something to think and feel sad about. It smashes you -- gently."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,88,"A heady stew of psychological disorders and classic tragedies, borrowing from Shakespeare, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and the Greeks."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,88,"Hulk represents the most involving superhero motion picture since ""Superman"" soared skywards in 1978. By taking its time to develop characters and situations, Hulk does what so many action/adventure movies fail to do -- allow us to really feel for the protagonists."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,80,"The result is perhaps the most elegantly shot, and certainly the most disturbing, of the recent fantasy films."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,80,"Where so many comic-book movies feel as disposable as Kleenex, the passionate, uncynical Hulk stamps itself into your memory. Lees movies are built to last."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,80,"Hits on all cylinders -- a smart blend of acting, direction, editing, design, costumes and effects."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,78,"No one has ever succeeded with anything approximating the sheer energetic brilliance of what Lee has managed here. For all intents and purposes, this is a comic-book movie in the very truest and most vibrant sense of the phrase."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,"The Hulk has a split personality: Two-thirds come from director Ang Lee, one-third from '60s comic book creator Stan Lee."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,Ang Lee has boldly taken the broad outlines of a comic book story and transformed them to his own purposes; this is a comic book movie for people who wouldn't be caught dead at a comic book movie.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,Lees use of split-screens and dynamic transitions makes the process of actively interpreting his monstrous vision a fresh and unrivaled experience.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,"Lee's technique is impeccable, but he's chasing more inner demons than one creature feature can handle. No wonder the audience cheers when TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno shows up for a cameo. It's a reminder of a time when it was easier being green and a Hulk could just get pissed off and bust shit up."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,75,"Always energetic and sometimes cockamamie enough to be genuinely fun, Hulk is the blockbuster to beat this season."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,"The real star is the splendid computer-generated Hulk, though his King Kong-like story is compromised by the need to keep him around for the inevitable sequel."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,This impeccably crafted piece of megabuck fantasy storytelling aims to pull off the tricky feat of significantly reworking the superhero format while still providing the expected tentpole-type entertainment thrills for the international masses.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,"The Hulk is a beautiful movie, but it's unlikely to win points as a monster flick -- it's too elegant, too whimsical."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,70,"Takes the form of a wounded behemoth, battling to negotiate a compromise between a strong artistic vision and franchise expectations. It doesn't fully succeed on either count, but its integrity and substance stand out like an oasis in a field of cotton candy."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,67,"Director Ang Lee displays enormous verve and flair. He creates ingenious transitions between scenes, deploying split-screens in a clever variation on comic book panels and, as ever, drawing coolly impassioned performances from the cast."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,63,"Whereas the psychology is surreal and wonderfully fluid, the action is too real and surprisingly listless, displaying little of the kinetic zip, or the sheer lyricism, that Lee brought with such memorable effect to ""Crouching Tiger."""
Hulk,5.6,132177234,63,"I wanted more. I expected more. The filmmakers said it was going to be smart - really smart - like all of Lee's movies. Instead, it's big, dumb and fun."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"However nifty, Lee's Cubist gambit fails to capture the graphic tension that makes great comic-book art jump off the page and great pop movies jump off the screen with pow, zap and wow!"
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"In the end, we don't know what we're watching, an art-house superhero film or a computer-generated ""King Kong."" By trying to please both sensibilities, the filmmakers have pleased neither."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"Some Marvel fans and die-hard devotees of Lou Ferrigno, the bodybuilder who played The Hulk on television (and who does a brief walk-on here), may find Ang Lee's whole enterprise grandiose and, given its not-always-successful attempt to fuse brains and brawn, a little bit silly."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"Folks read comics for enjoyment, not to admire how well the pictures are drawn, and the same axiom can be directed here with audiences likely to admire the work thats gone into this film -- rather than joyously enjoying the film itself."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,60,"As this all plays out -- and basically segues into ""King Kong"" -- the movie wins its biggest gamble: its entirely computer-generated monster works."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,58,"The main problem with The Hulk, really, is that there isn't enough Hulk in it."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"More thoughtful and pleasing to the eye than any blockbuster in recent memory, but its epic length comes without an epic reward. It's a slow ride to the same old place, nonstop action, accelerating in scale, culminating in the smirking promise of a sequel."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"Nolte's exploding patriarch jacks up the story's antisocial wish fulfillment into a Nietzschean-anarchist's wet dream, but one can only vainly hope that the preordained sequel will head in that dastardly direction."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,The entirely computer-generated Hulk is a surprisingly expressive creation  it certainly gives a better performance than Connelly  but the action is late in coming and feels like a long set-up for the inevitable sequel.
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"There's a fine line between darkness and glumness, one that ""Spider-Man"" bounced off buildings to avoid. The Hulk lumbers across it."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"To answer your first question: like a cross between Shrek, the Frankenstein monster, and a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"Unlike your average comic-book blockbuster, The Hulk isn't a bad cartoon. It's a bad modern Greek tragedy. It's a swing at the moon that looks (and smells) like green cheese."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,50,"A comic-book superhero has seldom squandered so much screen time being conflicted about his heritage and destiny -- and I don't mean conflicted in a sexy, Wolverine-y, ''X-Men'' way, either; a big-budget comic-book adaptation has rarely felt so humorless and intellectually defensive about its own pulpy roots."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,42,"Lee must have thought he could work a similar magic on this clunking, clanking machine. But despite a few witty wipes and split-screen tricks, he fails. Hulk is no better than hulking."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,40,"This messy, disappointing, self-important and utterly humorless version of the Marvel comic book character may be the toughest flick with a green protagonist to sit through since ""The Grinch."""
Hulk,5.6,132177234,40,"Belabored, ostentatious, overlong behemoth."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,38,"The Hulk goes on for two hours and 20 minutes and there's not a stirring or exciting moment in it...At last, a comic-book movie that National Public Radio listeners can be proud to take their kids to see."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,30,"The movie is bulky and inarticulate, leaving behind a trail of wreckage and incoherence."
Hulk,5.6,132177234,30,In future Lee can best serve his versatility by never doing anything like this again.
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Mad Max has always radiated an otherworldly vibe, a slightly sickly sensation that something at its core is fundamentally wrong."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Miller's work has been compared to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, but where the Leone films are about amorality, the Mad Max movies are purely and simply amoral—some of the most determinedly formalist filmmaking this side of Michael Snow."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,90,"Simple, but effective."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"With his instinct and craft, Miller has provided more autosuggestive violence on a $1 million budget than The Blues Brothers did with half the Chicago police force and $30 million."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"The tone sometimes wavers into self-parody, and there are occasional crude patches, but overall this edge-of-seat revenge movie marks the most exciting debut from an Australian director since Peter Weir."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,80,"It's pretty much assumed throughout art and literature that the collapse of civilization will result in the rise of barbarism. That assumption underlies Mad Max, where the strong prey on the weak, and Max steps in to be the equalizer."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"Though the plot is that of a simple revenge western, director George Miller infuses the film with a kinetic combination of visual style, amazing stunt work, creative costume design, and eccentric, detailed characterizations that practically jump out of the screen and grab the viewer by the throat."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"The film belongs to the director, cameraman and stunt artists: it’s not an actor’s piece, though the leads are all effective."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,75,"Less pretentious and more gripping than the overrated sequel, ''The Road Warrior,'' but viciously violent and awfully shallow."
Mad Max,6.9,8750000,70,"The chase scenes are top notch. Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of slow parts as well. Another bizarre aspect of Mad Max is that the voices were re-dubbed. Director George Miller, decided that the American public wouldn't be able to understand the Australian accents. It's not as bad as it sounds, but it's definitely a noticeable annoyance."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"Every now and then, a film comes along that both defies and compels description. District 9 is one such movie: a science-fiction action vehicle so brilliantly and fully imagined that real life, when it resumes after the credits, arrives with a new sense of dread."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"A sci-fi-fueled indictment of man's inhumanity to man -- and the non-human -- District 9 is all horribly familiar, and transfixing."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"To his credit, however, the often-playful Blomkamp never bludgeons his audience with any specific message. He's too busy letting 'er rip with his edge-of-your-seat, and unapologetically violent, sci-fi adventure."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"No true fan of science fiction -- or, for that matter, cinema -- can help but thrill to the action, high stakes and suspense built around a very original chase movie."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"The humanity of District 9 adds another dimension to this multilayered, rewarding work -- one of the best of the summer, and undoubtedly the most inventive from the multiplex this year."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"Madly original, cheekily political, altogether exciting District 9."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"District 9 is very smart sci-fi, but that's just the beginning; it's also a scathing social satire hidden inside a terrific action thriller teeming with gross aliens and regrettable inter-species conflict. And it's a blast. . . ."
District 9,7.9,115646235,100,"District 9 proves that genre films, besides being a hell of a lot of fun, can say things you hadn't considered and show stuff you haven't seen."
District 9,7.9,115646235,91,"This is a delicious premise, and Blomkamp, who first played with it in a 2005 short called ""Alive in Joburg,"" has magnified and improved it with ferocious energy, wit and style."
District 9,7.9,115646235,90,Grabs you by the eyeballs from the very first frame.
District 9,7.9,115646235,90,"Though compelling throughout, District 9 never becomes outright terrifying, largely because Blomkamp is less interested in exploiting his aliens for cheap scares than in holding up a mirror to our own bloodthirsty, xenophobic species."
District 9,7.9,115646235,90,"District 9 whizzes by with a resourcefulness and mordant wit nearly worthy of its obvious influences: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Starship Troopers."""
District 9,7.9,115646235,89,"Blomkamp and his entire cast and crew have created an instant genre classic that transcends the self-limiting ghetto implied by the term ""science fiction"" and instead, like precursors such as Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" engages not only the mind but the heart as well. It's magnificent."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"A great-looking and smart film. It has enough action, wonder, depth, and action to keep any fan of the genre happy. The sociological undertones here are fascinating as well."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,The reason District 9 reverberates so loudly is because its moral indignation is cranked to 11.
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"Anyone who watches District 9 and doesn't think of Apartheid, Nazis, and Josef Mengele needs to spend some time reading a few history books."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"South African director Neill Blomkamp set and shot the film around his native Johannesburg, so parallels to apartheid leap to mind. Yet the script he wrote with Terri Tatchell applies to any culture that bluntly excludes another."
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,Attention all geeks (and geeks at heart): Get ready for two hours of serious awesome.
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,This baby has the stuff to end the movie summer on a note of dazzle and distinction.
District 9,7.9,115646235,88,"With its clever faux documentary style, this is the most imaginative science-fiction movie to come along in years."
District 9,7.9,115646235,83,"The ad campaign for the sci-fi thriller District 9, with mysterious billboards touting aliens among us, is highly creative and amusing. So, in patches, is the movie, which is a thinking man's, or man-boy's, ""Transformers."""
District 9,7.9,115646235,83,"District 9 fuses science fiction mayhem and biting social commentary as well as any film since ""Starship Troopers."" It’s the rare alien invasion story that has the aliens running scared."
District 9,7.9,115646235,80,"A memorable, monstrous fable that's consistently gripping."
District 9,7.9,115646235,80,Blomkamp’s prawn cocktail has more than enough stylistic chutzpah and originality to make District 9 an essential date.
District 9,7.9,115646235,80,"In the best B-movie tradition, the filmmakers embed their ideas in an ingenious, propulsive and suspenseful genre entertainment, one that respects your intelligence even as it makes your eyes pop (and, once in a while, your stomach turn)."
District 9,7.9,115646235,75,"Despite its creativity, the movie remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction."
District 9,7.9,115646235,75,"The last time I felt the sort of outrageously kinetic action-movie high District 9 delivers, it was 1981 and George Miller, Mel Gibson, and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" had just come roaring out of Australia."
District 9,7.9,115646235,75,"Some movies pack such a terrific central idea, even their flaws can’t stop the train. District 9 is one of them."
District 9,7.9,115646235,70,"There is a lot of shield-your-eyes ickiness in District 9, a lot of violence and gore. What there is not a lot of, however, is humanity - even in the film's depiction of the inhumanity humans are capable of."
District 9,7.9,115646235,63,"As an allegory of racial conflict and mass immigration, District 9 never really goes anywhere: The appealing premise fades into the background before 20 minutes have elapsed."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"Unfortunately, as in many such big-screen comic books, the backstory beats the hell out of the present-tense plot."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"The movie falls into the same uneasy category as ""Eight Legged Freaks"": too tongue-in-cheek to be thrilling, not funny enough to be a comedy."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"It's a bad joke that District 9 will be hailed for its ""originality."""
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"Yes, the premise is delightful; no, the delight doesn't last."
District 9,7.9,115646235,50,"There's a wonderfully sly, farcical verve to these early moments, but it dissipates when the script, with its strains of ""E.T."" and ""The Fly,"" moves into high sci-fi gear."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,75,"This has to be an intentional wink from Stallone and his contemporaries. They know their days are not only numbered as action stars, but probably should have ended long ago."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,75,"So let me just say that this latest rah-rah red-meat installment is the biggest and best surprise of the series. It has its flaws, but it's mostly a big, dumb, gruntingly monosyllabic hoot."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,67,"There have been some reports that this is the last entry in the series, but it feels like the franchise is (finally) just getting started. ""The Expendables 4"" anyone?"
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,67,"It is forgettable fluff, but well-delivered, and it suggests that they'll be able to keep making these as long as they can prop up the cast, and with the younger generation making a decent showing this time out, they may even be able to hand it off when the time comes."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,63,"It’s a preposterously overstuffed strategy that, go figure, not only works, but even cures a thing or two that ailed the previous movies."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,60,"The Expendables 3 has its cake and shoots it: armed to the nipples with vast action and bulging A-listers, but over-over-blown and overcrowded. See it for Gibson’s big-bad."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,60,The Expendables 3 marks a sizeable improvement on the first two outings.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,58,"With its third entry, the Sylvester Stallone-led Expendables franchise finally becomes the live-action Saturday morning cartoon it was always destined to be."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"Joke’s way over, guys, and everyone’s now uncomfortable, thanks. Now, who needs a drink…?"
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"For a mostly brainless movie, The Expendables 3 has a surprisingly dense plot, which is part of the problem. The 2-hour running length is unnecessarily long."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"The best thing about this self-mocking affair, which runs a leisurely two-plus hours and affords plenty of time for an insane body count, is Antonio Banderas' manic gusto in the role of a gabby mercenary."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"Antonio Banderas pretty much steals The Expendables 3. But at this stage in that winded franchise, that amounts to petty theft."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,50,"Hughes and cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. handle the assignment skillfully enough, but without much imagination, sticking to a conventional action style that is more about the quantity of explosions than nuances of execution."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Studying the topography of decay in a veteran actor’s face is one of the few worthy pursuits for moviegoers sitting through the epic-length, belligerently inconsequential The Expendables 3 — a picture whose very title proclaims its redundancy."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Hughes' sequel fails because it makes no attempts whatsoever to rise above its predicable formula, even with the new cast additions and a promising director."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"It’s all a bit like a classic-rock tribute concert, or playing with all your action figures at once, or maybe “Cannonball Run,” with the strained buddy-buddy back-and-forth."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Expendables 3 is a kind of ho-hum experience, wherein a lot of bullets are expended and a lot of structures exploded to minimal dramatic effect."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"The charm of these movies — such as it is — comes from the notion of aging action stars slugging it out between wheezes. So when Stallone brings in a new cast of mostly generic warriors, the premise, like the movie, deflates."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"The film actually has some solid elements—a couple of appealing supporting performances, a good villain, effective comic relief, and even some awkward but sincere attempts at subtext about its aging cast. But the fact remains: An Expendables movie should be fun, and for long stretches, this one isn’t."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"Thank the gods of war for Antonio Banderas, who single-handedly steals (and almost saves) the show as a loquacious assassin."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"The Expendables 3 is silly and overblown, yes, and it could definitely do without Antonio Banderas‘ motor-mouth routine (not to mention an out-of-nowhere reference to Benghazi), but it's less silly and overblown than “The Expendables 2,” for whatever that's worth."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,[A] blundering jackhammer of a film.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,40,"You can’t help but wonder if some important people in boardrooms watched the last two Expendables films and, between sips of mineral water, diligently noted all the ways in which the third might be made slicker and more polished, without realising the franchise’s doughy unslickness was the wellspring of its charm."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,37,The movie’s action sequences are both thrilling and idiotic.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,30,"A sad, bad, parade of uninspired cameos and listless violence."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,30,Cripplingly lifeless.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,30,"What the movie ultimately demonstrates is that the sum total is less than the individual parts when you add together Rocky, the Terminator, Indiana Jones, Mad Max, Blade, Zorro, Hercules, and the Transporter."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,25,"The Expendables 3, trading on our affection for action stars of the past, has officially worn out its already shaky welcome."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,25,"The latest iteration of Sylvester Stallone’s aging warrior franchise, The Expendables 3, is proof that sometimes even your low expectations can be far too high."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,25,The Expendables 3 is as boneheaded and disposable as it sounds.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,25,The Expendables 3 is proof a movie can be exceedingly loud and excruciatingly dull.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,25,"Really, The Expendables 3 has only one thing going for it, beyond the unremarkable novelty of seeing lots of celebrities in a lousy movie. It has Mel Gibson, who is at his grim, tormented and quirky best here, playing someone who has crossed a moral line and has no regrets."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,25,"For all the brawn on display, the film never slows down to take in the thrill and talent of hand-to-hand combat."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,20,The Expendables 3 lets down its cast with a film that’s about as thrilling as the arrival of a monthly Social Security check.
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,20,"This is the sort of numbskull non-entertainment that considers it worthwhile to fly in a martial-arts superstar like Jet Li and have him sit around firing a machine gun, pausing every so often to deliver the most awkward line readings of his career."
The Expendables 3,6.1,39322544,0,Time to pull the plug on this brain-dead franchise.
Willow,7.3,57269863,63,"Its pacing is too deliberate, and it doesn’t have a light heart. That’s revealed in the handling of some characters named the Brownies, represented by a couple of men who are about 9 inches tall and fight all the time. Maybe Lucas thought these guys would work like R2-D2 and C-3PO did in “Star Wars.” But they have no depth, no personalities, no dimension; they’re simply an irritant at the edge of the frame."
Willow,7.3,57269863,63,"Built on fantasy stereotypes – friendly little folk, evil witches, misunderstood heroes, guys on horseback with bloody great swords – it nonetheless contains enough epic action, narrative momentum and spit-and-sawdust pre-CGI special effects to hold the attention."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"Every aspect of WILLOW seems as if it were written in stone before a shot was filmed. The plot grinds on inescapably to its predictable climax, with the viewer fully aware of what awaits long before the events unfold."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"Willow is medieval mishmash from George Lucas, a sort of 10th-century ""Star Wars"" tossed together with a plethora of elements taken from numerous classic fables. Even if Lucas has bastardized his own story with derivative and unoriginal elements, kids probably will love it. For MGM Pictures, b.o. should mean recoupment of its large investment."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"This is pretty much the Lucas mixture as usual, this time in a Tolkien mode, with everything from the Old Testament to Kurosawa to Disney fed into a blender and turned into wallpaper. For easy-to-please five-year-olds of all ages."
Willow,7.3,57269863,60,"Producer-for-Life George Lucas puts his awesome creative machinery to work in Willow, a would-be adventure of little people, big people, good guys and bad. But the fantasy wheels grind to a halt, bogged down in Lucas' flat, derivative story, and not helped in the least by director Ron Howard's clumsy steering."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,80,"Retains the earlier film's ability to delight the viewer with surprise effects and flights of fancy, only now the effects are better."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,75,"The hang-loose grodiness of these films has its charms, and the Ray-Banned team of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, at its best, is good vaudeville."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,70,"It's visual magic, and director Barry Sonnenfeld, who followed his MIB high with the lows of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Big Trouble,"" revels in it. He doesn't so much direct MIBII as load it with cool stuff and flit around to whatever takes his fancy. As summer escapism goes, you could do worse."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,70,It's a welcome and nicely goofy bit of sci-fi froth with the occasional hint of genuine comic smarts.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,67,"Short, flashy and about as complex as a beer belch, Men in Black II is also brisk. The film clocks in at 88 minutes total running time, and it's loaded with new special effects and monsters."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,Would be a thoroughly entertaining affair if it wasn't for one thing: the plot. The annoying and pointless storyline is a constant irritant because it diverts our attention from the real reason to see this movie - the easygoing chemistry between actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"So eager to please, it practically licks you in the face."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"Large budget notwithstanding, the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride. But this time, the old MIB label stands for Milder Isn't Better."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"The most refreshing thing about the original Men in Black was that it was relatively small - a modest, slapdash, 98-minute special-effects farce. The most refreshing thing about Men in Black II is that it is 10 minutes shorter."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"Elaborate, sporadically amusing but awfully lightweight followup, which has close to the same tone as its predecessor but makes one realize that freshness had a lot to do with its impact."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,63,"Hey, I'm not saying it's bad. It's kind of entertaining, what I can recall of it after two days. It's, uh, okay. Just okay, though."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,The only active ingredient is the dynamic between Smith and Jones. There's just enough of that to get us through.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"As fizzy as the first, but not quite as refreshing. The pleasurable, eye-popping sense of surprise has diminished, and the teasingly referential attitude shows signs of fatigue."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion; others create ultimate thrills. Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"There's something wrong with this picture, and the problem is there on Smith's face -- Smith looks distressingly I-was-an-Oscar-nominee bored. That goes double for Jones."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"To his eternal credit, Jones gives his considerable all and even coaxes a startling note of poignancy from one scene, while Smith just bops along, lobbing gags and grinning at the special effects."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,60,"Suffers from a fatal lack of purpose. This sleek, visually inventive but frustratingly flat movie is made up entirely of throwaway bits -- occasionally amusing, even ingenious bits. But still, they're just bits."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,58,"However cool, Smith's lovable braggadocio and Lee's practiced deadpan don't exactly make them Laurel and Hardy."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,It's a stylish package with not much inside.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,A talking bulldog named Frank steals the show.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"None of it sticks, but with the door left open for a third Men In Black movie, the one advantage of forgetting everything is not knowing exactly what's coming two summers from now."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,A business-as-usual blockbuster blueprint that rarely surprises you.
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"On the positive side, the four Worm Guys haven't lost their squiggly charm, and Rip Torn is always welcome as MIB mastermind Zed. On the minus side, you get two Johnny Knoxvilles, one of them a tiny head that protrudes from the big one's shoulder."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"Moderately amusing sequel, which is best when it relies on dead-pan acting by the stars, worst when it drags in summer-movie stupidities like an incessantly talking dog."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"For all its bells and whistles, only when it lingers on Jones' dry wit and pained, rheumy eyes does this film about aliens ever seem alive, let alone human."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,Here's an idea: Let's just take that same gizmo-packed alien-attack buddy-flick blockbuster from the summer of '97 ... and make it dumber!
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"Smith and Jones sometimes have to paddle hard to keep their heads above the toilet water in which screenwriters Robert Gordon (Galaxy Quest) and Barry Fanaro (Kingpin) occasionally dunk them. But if the presence of Smith and Jones is indeed the tinker-proof ingredient of the Men in Black formula, little else seems to have survived the production unaltered."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,50,"A disappointment. A good-faith attempt has been made to duplicate the original elements, but the mix is wrong, bearings have been lost, the balance is off. It was attitude that made ""Men in Black"" special, a particular kind of cool insouciance that has proved as impossible to duplicate as it was irresistible to experience."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,42,"The astonishing success of the original ""MiB"" was partly because it was fun, partly because it was unexpected. We'd never seen anything like it, while with MiBII, we've seen something exactly like it."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,40,"Smith and Jones seem like superannuated company men: They're going through the motions, but the zip is gone."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,40,"Mercifully short -- a mere 80 minutes, plus the end-titles. That means I had to slap myself in the face fewer times than usual to stay awake in a movie this grindingly mediocre."
Men in Black II,6.1,190418803,40,"If it isn't the worst sequel ever made, it's only because it has too much competition: Impersonal and frenetic, it's a landmark Hollywood disgrace."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,70,"Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,60,"There's something almost maniacally heroic about packaging the fourth sequel of a superhero action series without resorting to the old standbys of good writing, capable acting or inspired directing."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,58,"Unfortunately, the charming Batfamily can't stay in their cave indefinitely; they've got to go out and fight crime. And that's where this elaborately high-style production from Batman Forever director Joel Schumacher hits an iceberg."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"Batman & Robin, like the first three films in the series, is wonderful to look at, and has nothing authentic at its core."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"This film, which places yet another actor in the batsuit, has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel -- pointless, plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless, comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"It's the lightest of the Batman movies, the most cartoony, the dumbest and the least ambitious. But it holds the audience's attention, brings on a few laughs and never really gets boring."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"George Clooney looks great in a cape, but this fourth installment in the series has invested so much capital in razzle-dazzle special effects that it hardly matters whose head is under the pointy-eared helmet."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,50,"Unfortunately, the operative word is bland, as the newcomers don't add much to the formula, leaving it to their nemeses to enliven the proceedings. Narrative drive and humor are also in short supply, which creates a serious sagsag in the middle when the novelty of the fresh components has mostly worn off."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,40,"There's so much happening in the movie that it feels like nothing is happening at all. Which leaves you free to gaze, slack-jawed, on the true glory of Batman & Robin -- its fabulously color-coded set design."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,40,It's a gee-whiz kiddie movie imagined by pervy grown-ups who get a giggle out of mixing bloodless fight scenes with close-ups of rubber-wrapped butts and baskets.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,30,"It has none of the minor virtues of Schumacher's other films. It looks bad: cluttered surfaces, production design reminiscent of overblown Broadway musicals, editing too fast for the eye to catch up, poor staging of fast action."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,30,"Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has written quips, not characters and Joel Schumacher still seems miscast as a Bat-action director: he stages the mayhem confusingly and the comedy too broadly."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,25,Clooney's stiff cornball delivery and tendency to smile during the most tragic moments bring this as close to the cartoonish Batman television series of the 1960s as any of the movies have come.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,"The current Bat cycle was already tired when Schumacher replaced Tim Burton behind the camera on ""Batman Forever."" This chapter -- so action-packed, yet so insufferably dull -- makes it clear that there's nowhere else to go."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,"Batman & Robin fails to engage the spirit of Batman, Robin, or decent marketing in general, and instead ends up as a limp, excruciatingly shallow knockoff that leaves viewers cringing at the unavoidable one-liners that make up the better part of the script."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,It's clear that writer Akiva Goldsman and director Joel Schumacher are bereft of ideas and using the MTV clutter as a cover-up.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,The fourth installment in the Batman franchise is one long head-splitting exercise in clueless cacophony that makes you feel as though you're being held hostage in some haywire Planet Hollywood while sonic booms pummel your auditory canal.
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,20,"Lacking most kinds of inspiration and geared to undemanding minds, this project is so overloaded with hardware and stunts, it's a relief to have it over."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,10,"Clooney fails to make much of an impression as The Batman, but to make an impression amongst all the garish theatrics, he would pretty much have to shout his dialogue in rhyming verse, backwards."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,10,"Like a wounded yeti, Batman & Robin drags itself through icicle-heavy sets, dry-ice fog and choking jungle vines, before dying in a frozen heap. Unfortunately, that demise occurs about 20 minutes into the movie, which leaves you in the cold for approximately 106 minutes."
Batman & Robin,3.7,107325195,0,"Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,70,Stargate is a clever adventure that should find its audience.
Stargate,7.1,71565669,70,"Stargate is peppered with numerous minor faults, some of which - although not all - are easily forgiven. It's the bigger plot problems and lackluster climax which are more difficult to excuse."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,63,"Roland Emmerich hasn't bettered us as a culture with Stargate, but he hasn't corrupted us, either."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,63,"By the end, the film’s early promise has pretty much degenerated into routine pyrotechnics."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"The film has flashes of psychedelic visual energy, but its story is limp."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"Without Davidson Stargate might seem clunky and routine, but he gives it a weirdo charge. It may be a lousy movie, but it's a more enjoyably lousy movie than most."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"The arrival of Ra (Jaye Davidson), bearing sci-fi cliches, changes Stargate from a merely hokey movie to one that is truly ridiculous."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"The special effects turn out to be not very special and not very effective, and the movie never achieves the lunatic grandeur of the truly demented. Stargate is strictly for the peanut gallery."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"Stargate is like a film school exercise. Assignment: Conceive of the weirdest plot you can think of, and reduce it as quickly as possible to action movie cliches."
Stargate,7.1,71565669,50,"What this juvenile adventure has in spades is special effects and picturesque locations. What it lacks is an emotional link to make the Saturday afternoon he-man posturing palatable, or at least bearable."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,67,"Make no mistake, there will be a sequel. Clary may not wind up having the same pop-culture impact as Bella and Katniss, but like it or not, this won't be the last time you hear from her."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,63,Everything chugs along briskly and reasonably entertainingly until running off the rails a bit with a wildly overcomplicated finale.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Aside from the giggles induced by the romance-novel bits, the movie's principal hazard is exhaustion. There are too many characters, and too many of them spend too much time morphing into something else. Five more like this? That would be demonic."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Though imaginatively directed by Harald Zwart, Mortal Instruments, which is adapted from Cassandra Clare's YA novels, is marred by significant flaws."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,The movie﻿ blasts by for a while as an odd and busy slice of highly watchable garbage.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"The storyline is at times muddled and incoherent. This won't bother readers much since they have the ""inside track"" on what's happening. Then again, the narrative is so predictable that maybe it doesn't matter."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Borrowing every single component of its complicated plot from other sources, The Mortal Instruments is hodgepodge claptrap, but there’s a faint flicker of fun in its introducing-the-world passages."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"Start with a heaping helping of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Throw in some ""Percy Jackson,"" a dash of ""Twilight,"" a spoonful of ""The Vampire Diaries"" and a sprinkling of ""Harry Potter,"" and you end up with The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"There are elements worth celebrating. The movie is thankfully less self-serious than the mopey “Twilight” films. The Mortal Instruments revels in its own camp.  But there is plenty of room for improvement. The action flick is overly long, complicated and, even by teen romance standards, cringe-worthy in its cheesiness."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,50,"If you love exposition and shapely if bland young actors in leather, skinny jeans, knee boots, Goth cocktail dresses and heavy eye makeup, this may be the movie for you."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"As for some of the big reveals, viewers will see them coming from a galaxy far, far away."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"This initial “Mortal Instruments” picture has the vibe of a straight-to-video release from the mid-‘90s, except with a $60 million budget and considerable special-effects expertise."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"Apparently unable to decide whether to take its own mythology seriously or not, this is a mess of sculpted cheekbones and incoherent romance."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"It’s a potent mix for young fans that gets off to an entertaining, action-packed start with bursts of knowing humour. But it’s soon bogged down by an increasingly convoluted plot, an overindulgent running time and absurd dialogue."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"Despite the overstuffed assortment of vampires, werewolves, warlocks and demons of all shapes and sizes, The Mortal Instruments seldom feels like anything more than a shameless, soulless knockoff."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"A ludicrous, borderline-nonsensical supernatural concoction with a slightly redeeming sense of its own silliness."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"Too much of the film feels like shorthand, a trail of teasing crumbs to lead us to the inevitable sequels."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"There’s so much bouncing around in tone and story that this film never really finds its footing. It flounders around trying to figure out what it should be, and never really settles on anything."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,40,"There’s a germ of something interesting and different within the film’s narrative tangle, but it’s unfortunately been subsumed by Hollywood’s dedication to replicating previous successes."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,38,"That can’t disguise the script’s complete lack of wit or originality, though, or the generally wooden acting."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,38,"Though it has flashes of promise, Bones traces the footsteps of its fantasy film predecessors too closely to blaze anything close to an original narrative."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,30,"Not only have we seen this all before, but we were probably hoping to not see it again."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,30,"City of Bones isn’t the worst of its kind, but crap served with flair is still basically crap."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,30,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones is just a sloppy rag bag of ideas cobbled from other stories.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,30,"The nomenclature varies slightly, but there's little new or exciting in City of Bones. For strong female role models and unique fantasy settings, stick with The Hunger Games."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"These kids have to contrive magical pretexts just to lay hands on each other, and boy, are their excuses rotten."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"No matter how good The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones looks, it's hard to really care about anything that's going on, and not just because we could barely understand it."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"Every moviegoer will have his own breaking point, when The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones surpasses the mundane and enters the ridiculous."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"Within this bloated fantasy hodgepodge, there are few grace notes: In the role of the creepy fortune teller, Madame Dorothea, CCH Pounder is evil fun. And a few special effects, including a Rottweiller who turns into a skinned hellhound, leave an impression. Otherwise, Mortal Instruments manages to occupy 130 minutes of frantic, numbing, activity."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"This is a story that has everything you’re looking for, provided that you’re looking for absolutely nothing."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,25,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones hopes to be the start of a new franchise for tweens and Twihards, but the twuth is this twash is anything but a twiumph."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,This is film-making at its most cynical. But none of it actually makes much sense.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,"This one is by far the worst of the “Twilight” copies. And when that bunch includes “The Host” and “I Am Number Four,” that’s saying something."
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,The plot is an incomprehensible tangle of dead ends and recaps.
The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,5.9,31165421,20,"If only the fantasy surrounding her made a lick of sense. Here, the Muggle types are known as the “Mundane.” An apt label for a wanna-be franchise with plenty of sheen and nothing to say."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,70,The film delivers almost exactly what fans of the first installment are hoping for.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,70,"The most welcome change is the tone. Wadlow has decided he's making a straight-up comedy, and he demonstrates a knack for it."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,67,"It's rambunctiously amusing but the laughs clot in your throat. There's a meaner streak this time to Kick-Ass and Hit Girl's exploits, or maybe Carrey's sensitivity is justified. Either way, the third act of Kick-Ass 2 is a visceral beatdown."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,63,"I do get a chuckle out of movies with wildly inappropriate behavior, rude language and ultramayhem, especially when they involve children, but Kick-Ass 2 sometimes felt like being trapped in a room with the funniest guy in seventh grade."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,63,Tone isn't the movie's sole problem. There's something off-putting about Christopher Mitz-Plasse as the chief bad guy.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"Kick-Ass 2, a movie that, for all its predictable sequel-ness, manages to conjure up pretty much the same dark magic that the earlier film did, albeit with more troubling results. Believe it or not, Kick-Ass 2 is even more of a provocation than the first Kick-Ass."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"As diverting as this action-packed caper often is, it feels not just weightless but emotionally and morally stunted whenever it veers into grown-up dramatic territory."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"A more modest success than the first ""Kick-Ass,"" but still of-a-piece with its scurrilous predecessor. Nobody flies a jet-pack up a skyscraper this time, but Kick-Ass 2 still has its share of over-the-top action, and the sweary laughs are just about intact."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"A fun if sporadically schizoid return to one of the brighter, brasher comic-bookers of recent years."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,60,"The best thing about ‘Kick-Ass’ was Moretz, and Hit-Girl still gets the best lines. Like the first film, Kick-Ass 2 pulls the reality of teen life into its fantasy."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,56,Faithful to the superficial thrills and flaws of the original.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Moretz, who is 16 now, can't manufacture the same that's-so-wrong jolt she managed the first time around. Back then, it was hilariously taboo to see a little girl spout arias of profanity. Now, she's just another teenager swearing. Like the rest of the film, what was once shocking now just elicits a shrug."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Like its own protagonists, Kick-Ass 2 can’t decide what it wants to be when it grows up: a vessel for unhinged vengeance and destruction or a meta-critique of those same impulses. In going for both, it winds up being neither."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Kick-Ass 2 has a mean-spirited vigilante streak the first film lacked (it seemed more concerned with justice, in its way), as well as a fatigue. It’s still funny, particularly when Hit Girl spews profanity and wields weapons. It’s just not as good."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"A weird mix of the refreshing and the dispiriting, Kick-Ass 2 is appealing in its brutal honesty and repellent in its honest brutality."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"To stand out in a crowded marketplace, a sequel can’t just kick ass — it has to blow minds."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,What seemed edgy and brash in Kick-Ass is now routine and old-hat. The first movie was a brash satire on formulaic comic-book movies — exactly the sort of picture the sequel turns out to be.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Even with its edges sanded down, Kick-Ass 2 is unmistakably Millaresque — a juvenile comedy of excess, in which skewering adolescent power fantasies looks an awful lot like indulging in them."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Kick-Ass 2 returns with the original’s rollicking sense of vulgarity and bodily trauma fully intact, but the story has more plot lines to string together than absolutely necessary."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"Kick-Ass 2 is a lesser version of what it appears to be, an uncertain jumble rather than a true exploration of outrage, violence and identity."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"The crime isn’t that Kick-Ass 2 is vulgar (which it is), but that it’s for so little gain."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,50,"That makes Kick Ass 2 more sour than sweet, a movie that jokes about comic book fanboys but stops short of mocking them the way the first film did."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,40,The meta-satire hits you over the head until not just your Spidey sense is tingling.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,40,"A messy, confused, over-the-top mixture of brutality and sick comedy, puckishness and ugliness, self-awareness and tone-deafness."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,40,"Your ass is constantly braced in readiness and hope, but it remains un-kicked."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"Kick-Ass 2 is an uninspired retread. All too often it plays like a Comic-Con gone insane, with costumed do-gooders taking on costumed criminals in gratuitously vicious battles."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"Kick-Ass is a prime example of a movie that never should have bothered with a sequel. Not only is its successor played-out, but it revels in carnage while lacking the visual style and gleeful humor of the original."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"In the annals of sequeldom, Kick-Ass 2 has to be one of the lamest follow-ups ever."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,38,"It's no better, no worse and essentially no different from the jocular, clodhopping brutality of the first one."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,25,Kick-Ass 2 is a special kind of crap: the kind smart people make for audiences they think are stupid.
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,25,"If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who carries the film on her own small shoulders."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,25,"The film doubles down on the love-hate relationship with ultra-violence that typified its predecessor, but A History of Violence this is not."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,12,"Arriving at the tail end of blockbuster season, this cheaply produced sequel to the surprise 2011 hit arrives in plenty of time to claim the title of the year’s most unpleasant movie."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,10,"The writer and director, Jeff Wadlow, can’t obscure the movie’s misogyny, and he also has a tough time staging a scene and selling a joke. His worst offense is that he has no understanding of the power, gravity and terrible beauty of violent imagery, which means he has no grasp of cinema."
Kick-Ass 2,6.6,28795985,0,One of the year's worst films.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,88,Snow White and the Huntsman reinvents the legendary story in a film of astonishing beauty and imagination.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,80,"I resisted this derivative mishmash of classic fairytale and modern epic fantasy for as long as I could, but ultimately it swept me up into its geeky but manly embrace and carried me away on a white charger."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,78,"Ambitious, brutish, ruthlessly unromantic – has the right idea casting its heroine as a Joan of Arc-type crusader and its evil queen a dissertation (albeit first draft) on beauty as the most direct path to power for the disenfranchised female."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"Attempts to inject a little humor via the antics of the dwarves don't work, especially since one of the little people is killed early in the proceedings. No one's going to be singing ""Hi ho! Hi ho! It's off to work we go!"" after that happens."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"Yes, there are many splendid reasons to see Snow White and the Huntsman – enough, maybe, not to care that neither Snow White nor the Huntsman rank high among them."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"A surprisingly fine, fantastic movie it is."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,75,"This is a violent film. It's rougher, in fact, than ""The Hunger Games."""
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,It is an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love - its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"An evil spell nearly does Snow White in, but it's lifted in the nick of time. The strangest spell afflicts Kristen Stewart; she can't seem to imbue Snow White with anything more than a semblance of feeling. That spell never lifts, but it doesn't make much difference in the end because the forces of good manage to work around it."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Though it is an ambitious - at times mesmerizing - application of the latest cinematic technology, the movie tries to recapture some of the menace of the stories that used to be told to scare children rather than console them."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Rare among the recent fairy tale adaptions (from ""Mirror Mirror"" to the dreadful ""Red Riding Hood"") the invigorating Snow White and the Huntsman actually breathes new life into an old story."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,"Never quite delivers on its promise -- a dark retelling of the fairy tale in which women hold the true power, good and evil -- but it certainly is an attractive misfire."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,70,The movie's revisionist tone is startlingly enough to carry you along.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,67,"If you've a mind to see a classic fairy tale rendered as an action movie, and if you want to see a sizeable handful of fine English actors have grand fun playing grizzled dwarves, there are worse ways to spend two hours than in the company of Snow White and the Huntsman."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,"The nearly two preceding hours often feel like three, as the patchwork script keeps introducing characters and subplots and dropping them, all while rushing characters through eye-popping environments."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,One of those movies that makes for a fantastic trailer. Much beyond that can feel like repeat viewing.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,Snow White and the Huntsman is definitely a missed opportunity. Sanders was on to something in taking the Snow White tale to its most menacing extreme.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,63,Just feels like it was made from the pieces of every fantasy-action movie ever made.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"The CGI effects are so slick that they undercut the movie's shock value, and the action moves too quickly to instill a real sense of fear, but this is still visually impressive, with spectacular make-up, costumes, and cinematography."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"It's Theron who owns this film, imbuing her deliciously depraved Queen with furious pain and deep-seated fear."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"Why can't heroines just be heroines anymore, instead of micromanaged personalities who may as well have the words ""Role Model"" tattooed across their foreheads?"
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"It's hard to imagine who will thrill to this violent, gorgeous, and empty film."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"The rousing speeches and booming battle scenes are all well done as far as blockbuster spectacle goes, but you can't help but feel the filmmakers' resistance to the story's grimmer undercurrents."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"A strong visual style tussles with flaccid storytelling in this ambitious retelling of Grimm. It won't exactly have Walt Disney spinning in his secret ice chamber, but you may wish they spent more time worrying about what exactly the film is than who it's for."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,60,"A visually inventive, deliciously dark fairytale reheat. The story's far from the stuff of legend, but Theron makes for a ferocious meanie, helping to flush away ""Mirror Mirror's"" sugary aftertaste."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,58,"Some of the fairy tale effects are marvelous; but the odyssey from darkness to light is unduly long and sloggy, and Stewart, with her contemporary edge, seems to be acting in the wrong era."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,58,A tastefully overbearing franchise fairy tale with a handful of ravishing touches.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"I spent several minutes not caring what was happening with the story but just observing the patchwork illusion of oversized props, short stunt doubles and computer grafting of big faces on small bodies. Nice work."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,A bold rethinking of a familiar old story and striking design elements are undercut by a draggy midsection and undeveloped characters in Snow White and the Huntsman.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"Handsome but hollow, Snow White & the Huntsman is easily among the stranger additions to a roster of rebooted fairy tales."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"As feminist fantasy, the film is non-committal, and as a reimagining of the fairy tale, it's at best expensive-looking without seeming wantonly so."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,50,"For all this Snow White's visual ornamentation, there's no sense of narrative priority - the filmmakers can't see the Dark Forest for the trees."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,45,"What dooms Snow White and the Huntsman is ultimately not how over the top it is, but how dull it is."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,42,"There are complicated elements at work here, with threads of curdled vengeance, victim entitlement, and insanity bound together in ways it would take a much smarter film to unravel. Snow White And The Huntsman doesn't try, and the film just keeps getting dumber as it goes along."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,40,The result is tangled and overblown.
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,38,"In Snow White and the Huntsman, this talented but woefully miscast actress (Stewart) is expected to rally an entire army of soldiers, even though she usually looks like she forgot the combination to her locker."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,30,"Snow White and the Huntsman, the first feature from British commercial director Rupert Sanders, has its work cut out for it if it wants to be a truly dull piece of junk - but it manages."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,25,"Suffers from a problem in its rhythm. It's not that its pace is too slow, but that it's too regular, and this lack of syncopation makes it feel slow."
Snow White and the Huntsman,6.1,155332381,25,"Overlong, overcrowded, overstimulating and with an over-the-top performance by Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna, the movie is a virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,100,"As challenging as it must have been to pilot Joss Whedon's space opera from the TV junk pile to the big screen, the finished product is a triumph."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,91,"If you think the ""Star Wars"" prequels are a disease, then Serenity is the cure."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,90,"This is a film that exists because of fans, was written for the fans and yet can be enjoyed by just about anyone willing to have a good time."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,90,Serenity is a trim little picture of epic proportions.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,88,"A brash, funny, action-packed bit of sci-fi ecstasy--and a giant raspberry to the execs who let ""Firefly"" fall out of the sky."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,88,"Whedon wants to make a Serenity trilogy, and I suspect the actors will grow on me if he does. In this case, familiarity would breed not contempt but comfort."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"Serenity is still taut, immersive, and alternately hilarious and heartbreaking, a well-balanced blend of whooping Wild West action and space opera."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"It's but a witty, engaging hodgepodge of archetypes and clichés; it retreads not only the TV show's story lines, but also those of every ""Star Trek"" and ""Gunsmoke"" episode. It needed the room of a big screen just to fit all of its influences into a single place."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,A highly entertaining piece of genre-blending fun.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"No matter what's coming their way, post-apocalyptic doom or gloom, this James Gang of the galaxy is just plain fun to watch."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"A sci-fi saga that manages to be at once stirring and screwball, gut-busting and gut-wrenching, and more fun than you had at any bigger-budget movie this past summer."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,80,"If you're a novice, this is a plucky introduction to Whedon's world and the most fun sci-fi of the year. If you're a devotee, this is the magnificent return you've been praying for."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,78,"Serenity evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original ""Star Wars"" films, a love that was mightily tested by George Lucas' humorless prequels."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Jaw set but never stiff, he (Fillion) gets both the Whedon wit and the Whedon grandiloquence between cheek and gum, and gives the whole enterprise the heft of a real saga."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity is made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity shows what might have happened if Han Solo had been the focus of the original ""Star Wars"" instead of whiny Jedi wannabe Luke Skywalker."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Although Mal is ostensibly the movie's hero, and River its heroine, Whedon does a good job of giving all onboard their own story arc, their tragedies and triumphs. The cast, to a man (and woman), is solid, although it's the ballet-trained Glau, who gets to mope in high angst and go Zhang Ziyi-crazy in a couple of martial-arts scenes, who steals the show."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"The film's strength is compelling character relationships and Whedon's trademark dialogue, a smarter version of the cliched action-movie barrage of wisecrack under fire, only better executed, laden in personality, and enriched with evocative western colloquialisms of a frontier culture."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"It features truly monstrous bogeymen in the Reavers, cannibalistic renegades who, legend has it, went to the edge of the universe and were driven mad by the abyss."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity may be short on exposition, but it's smart and fun."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"While it's a geek's paradise from scene one, newcomers are likely to feel left out until they get their bearings.  Fortunately, Whedon's characteristic humanity, coupled with the slyest sense of humor in Hollywood, greatly eases the transition."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"After witnessing the wearying parliamentary debates among good and bad senators in recent Star Wars episodes, it's a pleasure to watch a sci-fi movie where more than just the spaceships move quickly."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"A fast-paced, engaging science fiction adventure tale."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,75,"Serenity may not be the next ""Star Wars,"" but it's the best we've seen since the original trilogy, and if Wheedon is planning Serenity trilogy (the door is left open), it would certainly be welcome."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"What makes Serenity refreshing is its avoidance of CGI, which gives the pic a much more human dimension; the evident chemistry between the cast; and a humor that doesn't rely simply on flip one-liners."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Though richly allegorical, Serenity also works as a rousing and unabashedly manipulative adventure that never takes itself too seriously."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Scene for scene, Serenity is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"An appealingly low-rent, if not earth-shattering, 26th century ""Star Wars"" with faint glimmers of ""Blade Runner,"" ""Buckaroo Banzai"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for good measure."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,"Chiwetel Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things) is the sinister operative dispatched to retrieve the ship's psychic passenger, who as played by Summer Glau kickboxes better than Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi combined."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,70,I mean Serenity no disrespect when I say it's enjoyably junky.
Serenity,7.9,25514517,63,"For folks like me, who missed ""Firefly,"" the short-lived TV show on which the movie's based, watching Serenity is like showing up for a big lecture course at the end of the semester. And yet, after an hour of intense disorientation, the movie's arch sarcasm becomes oddly entertaining."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"It's the zippy chatter among the Serenity's wised-up space pirates that gives the film most of its punch, but with only serviceable action sequences and largely cookie-cutter effects, you can still sense the void just outside."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"The dialogue, delivered mostly in Southern accents, is intended to be funny and fresh, but much of this Western-influenced sci-fi adventure story feels reheated."
Serenity,7.9,25514517,50,"If you can't be original, why not borrow from something no one has seen, like Ben Affleck's last five movies?"
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,75,"The performances of Travis Fimmel, Toby Kebbell and Paula Patton as the warrior Lothar, the orc hero Durotan and the half-orc/half-woman Garona, all awakening to the evil forces around them, are meaty enough to hold attention."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,75,"Warcraft wins by not trying to be the second coming of a 10-hour cinematic trip through Mordor with Hobbits and jewelry. Rather, it’s a simpler, yet still wholly entertaining tale of magic and larger-than-life soldiers in a battle for survival."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,62,"It's a knock-down, drag-out fight between storytelling, franchise-making, and fan service, and some casualties were inevitable. But even a messy fight for nuance is better than an apathetic sell-out."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,60,"Tasked with brokering a peace between event-sized thrills, gaming lore and high fantasy, Jones embraces Warcraft’s world with laudable commitment: but when it comes to charging it with life, sheer bulk gets the better of him."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,60,"The movie is character-driven every step of the way. That’s why, even if the world created by Jones and his talented design collaborators, both old-school physical and cutting-edge digital, isn’t seamlessly believable so much as staggeringly crafted, it casts a spell."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,58,"Warcraft errs in how much it asks the audience to juggle, and as a result, the things that the film does well (and I think there are many) are muffled somewhat."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,Warcraft provides the shell of a great fantasy adventure saga but never effectively goes beyond that. This is much more like the bad fantasy of the 1980s and 1990s than the better brand we have recently become accustomed to.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,The dialogue is so earnest that its lack of humor becomes a source of humor in itself. The acting is so primal that you’ll swear a porn sequence is about to break out.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"There are stretches of tedium in this lumpy and derivative mythology, to be sure. But there are also immersive IMAX 3-D backdrops, striking ambiguities and irresistible moments of straight-faced lunacy. The line between hack work and labor of love may be perilously thin, but you can sense the difference in the way Jones earnestly, wholeheartedly embraces the magic that powers this realm."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"Probably the best way to experience Warcraft, a generally amusing and sometimes visually arresting absurdity, is stoned. If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn’t your idea of a good movie time, though, I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"No, Warcraft isn’t a ridiculous mess; it holds together on its own musclebound terms. It neither tries to be jokey nor undercuts itself by being unintentionally funny. And it offers a bit more complexity than some other nonstop action flicks adapted from video games. It’s a real movie, just not a good one."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"Proceed with caution to ""Warcraft,"" but there is entertainment to be found here. It's certainly more absorbing than the lazily assembled ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" because Jones' exertion and drive behind the film is palpable, if a bit sweaty."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"In spite of these deficiencies — the narrative wildness, the static characters, the impenetrable lore — Warcraft is still not entirely a failure, most of all because of its charming, almost admirable level of goofy conviction."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,50,"Warcraft may provide grand, thunderous spectacle as it transforms human actors into hulking Orcs, but when trying to perform the alchemy of transmuting genre archetypes into characters with soul, the magic fizzles out."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"You may not particularly enjoy Warcraft, but you kind of have to admire the audacity of its existence."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,It aims to match the mythic gravitas of “The Lord of the Rings” — even throwing in a nod to the Book of Exodus for good measure — and the results fall paint-by-numbers flat.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The ambition is laudible, but it's to little end. At once empty and impenetrable, this brings to mind a mix of John Carter and Dungeons And Dragons, regrettably in both themes and level of enjoyment."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The total absence of originality here is notable, but it needn’t have been a problem: with a tighter plot, a touch of humour and some peppier, less slab-fisted action scenes this might actually have worked – a kind of Guardians of the Galaxy meets Lord of the Rings."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The pristine setting never meshes with Jones’s efforts to give emotional reality to his army of characters, who cannot escape their tropes: leader, hero, warrior woman, mystic."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"Director Duncan Jones, a self-professed Warcraft fan, has clearly put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story, but it’s questionable whether it was ever really merited. There’s a terminal flimsiness, as if this virtually-derived world hasn’t quite assumed three dimensions."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,40,"The film takes a long time to build dramatic momentum and gets interrupted by what seem like unnecessary plot points; some of them, perhaps, geared towards potential sequels."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,"Just because you can come up with names such as Azeroth, Durotan, Orgrim, and Grommash Hellscream doesn't mean you're J.R.R. Tolkien, people."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,"There’s nary an honorable death that resonates, although we do get some creative visual perspectives on enthusiastically digitized brutality. But wasn’t the game good for that already?"
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,"This loud, bombastic, often incoherent mishmash of magical-themed storytelling simply was not worth whatever effort went into it. While there are some acceptable action sequences, it’s the screenplay — complicated by some less than inspired performances — that dooms “Warcraft” at every point along the way."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,38,The Warcraft hardcore can rejoice. Everyone else can move along. There’s not much to see here.
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,33,"Jones slaves to make something of the material, and to his credit, or rather his profoundly large cast and crew’s credit, the craft is certainly visible in Warcraft. It feels rude not to compliment the hard work of the makeup, costume, production design, and visual effects teams."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,33,"Definitively establishing that “state-of-the-art” and “chintzy” are not mutually exclusive qualities, Warcraft is a perplexing multiplex boondoggle: Rarely is so much time, money, and cutting-edge technology expended on a spectacle so devoid of wonder."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,30,"In short, Warcraft is the most wearying kind of bad movie, a dull and sad one that's less engaging a watch than just seeing the studio's millions run bill by bill through a shredder for two hours."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,30,"This is not ""Lord of the Rings."" It's barely ""Dungeons & Dragons."""
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,30,"So good at making the most outlandish elements of his first two films seem completely credible, Jones can’t find a way to get this cartoony spectacle to soar. His heartfelt approach to the material only underlines the silliness."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"If you’ve loved the game, you might appreciate the visuals cooked up for this fantasy universe. I was bored out of my skull, pretty much start to finish, from the “Lord of the Rings” opening to the Old Testament/Moses Afloat finale."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"Paula Patton, playing a half-orc, half-human female warrior, is the most sympathetic character and actually gives something approaching a fully fledged performance, but for the rest of it … ugliness as far as the eye can see."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"What's onscreen is a godawful mess, leaving the actors to suck wind while the film collapses around them. If you've never played the game, you might as well watch the movie stoned."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"It’s soulless, incoherent, Renaissance Faire hooey. And since the latest iteration of game series that inspired it, World of Warcraft, already peaked years ago, even the timing is off."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,25,"Watching this bloated mélange of derivative fantasy tropes unfold is akin to being forced to follow the efforts of a particularly ham-fisted gamer, with the viewer being jerked back and forth across countless busy CGI landscapes by a plot that's utterly predictable when it isn't confusing."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,12,"I’m also hoping that the game is more emotionally engaging — or at least, you know, fun — than the movie I just saw. Because that thing was a dour mess."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,12,"It’s all so plodding and grim, echoed by the blandly percussive score by Ramin Djawadi."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,10,"Imagine “Battlefield Earth” without the verve and you get this sludgy, tedious fantasy adventure, a fun-starved dud that’s not even unintentionally hilarious."
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,0,"Longtime World of Warcraft players should and likely will storm the cineplex gates, burn the castle down, and salt the earth (and screenwriters) from whence this abomination sprung. Me, I’m going to chill out and download 1982’s top-notch ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."""
Warcraft,6.9,47365290,0,"This is truly a depressing experience. It’s rare to feel such pity for a major studio movie, but watching Warcraft bend over backwards to set up a sequel is like watching a desperate paramedic apply CPR to someone who’s clearly been dead for hours."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,88,One of the most complex and visually interesting science fiction movies in a long time.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,83,"Starts out as mind-bending futuristic satire and then turns relentless -- it becomes a violent, postpunk version of an Indiana Jones cliff-hanger."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"A worthy entry in the dystopian cycle of SF movies launched by ""Blade Runner"" (including ""The Terminator"" and ""Robocop""), this seems less derivative than most of its predecessors yet equally accomplished in its straight-ahead storytelling, with plenty of provocative satiric undertones and scenic details."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"The fierce and unrelenting pace, accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay, keeps the film moving like a juggernaut."

Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,"An ""intelligent"" action film, because it presents the viewer with an opportunity to puzzle things out rather than sit mindlessly and watch people get blown to pieces."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,80,Mr. Verhoeven is much better at drumming up this sort of artificial excitement than he is at knowing when to stop.
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,75,"Actually, any fun you might encounter in Recall can be traced, most often, to director Verhoeven, who injects some of his ""Robocop"" camp into this mega-dumb project."
Total Recall,7.5,119394840,75,"Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent--let's not mince words--this film should be called ""Total Reject."""

Total Recall,7.5,119394840,63,"The overall effect is like wading through hospital waste. Verhoeven, who also directed the maliciously stylistic ""Robocop,"" disappoints with this appalling onslaught of blood and boredom."

The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"What makes the film so special is that Ford and Tommy Lee Jones (as his chief pursuer, US Marshal Samuel Gerard) are such beautifully matched adversaries."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"A tense, taut and expert thriller that becomes something more than that, an allegory about an innocent man in a world prepared to crush him."

The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"It's as powerful as it is bruising, with more surprises than ""Jurassic Park"" and more sheer energy than any action movie this season."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"The Fugitive is hardly Hitchcock — it never taps our emotions in a way that threatens to transcend the action — but it’s a mainstream thriller made with conviction, intelligence, and heat. In Hollywood, that used to be called professionalism. These days, it’s rare enough to look like artistry."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,100,"A super-adrenalized stemwinder, a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the tension so pitilessly tight it does everything but squeak."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,91,"A consummate nail-biter that never lags, it leaves you breathless from the chase yet anxious for the next bit of mayhem or clever plot twist."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,91,"Pure energy, a perfect orchestration of heroism, villainy, suspense and comic relief."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"It's a pleasure to find a thriller fulfilling its duties with such gusto: the emotions ring solid, the script finds time to relax into backchat, and for once the stunts look like acts of desperation rather than shows of prowess."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"Reimagined instead of recycled, an adaptation of a '60s old TV show emerges as a first-rate thriller."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"A crackling, intelligent thriller."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"The film is little more than a well-oiled machine that serves a strictly limited function, but like a precision timepiece, it is a thing to marvel at, even under close scrutiny."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,90,"A flurry of stunts, close shaves and deeds of desperate daring, it easily transcends its television origins to become a stylish pacemaker-buster."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,The performances transform this otherwise orthodox cat-and-mouse movie into a gripping experience.
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,"Though it's a good half hour too long, this belated, overblown spin-off of the 60s TV show otherwise adds up to a pretty good suspense thriller."

The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,88,The Fugitive runs hard and true the whole way through.
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,83,"Ford is up to par for the strenuous stuff, but falls short on the grief, anxiety and compassion, allowing Tommy Lee Jones to walk away with the show as the wisecracking marshal on Kimble's trail."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,80,"The action varies from a show-stopping train/bus wreck of Schwarzeneggerian proportions, to some more ironically staged pursuits which throw a welcome dash of ""Tom and Jerry"" into the mix."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,80,"As far as the chase genre goes, there have been worse films (better ones, too)."
The Fugitive,7.8,183875760,80,"Most big-screen adaptations of small-screen fare seek to discover some deeper - or, at least, more complex - implications of the material. But in this new Fugitive, the filmmakers have taken just the opposite approach."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,75,"A multi-colored downer fantasy which combines bursts of imagination with a bleak worldview, resulting in something that rarely feels mainstream."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,60,"Perhaps a folly and – Kikuchi aside - too deadpan to be a romp, this is still a decent, colourful samurai spectacle with a classical look (lots of symmetrical compositions) and a story which stands up under multiple retellings."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,"This one never quite decides if it wants to be a big, boisterous epic or a solemn retelling, and it nearly disappears into the crack between the two."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,An odd mix of stiff and sumptuous.
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,"There’s little sense of urgency, or — oddly, given the film’s title — of scale. You never really think that the 47 are truly outnumbered, and the large action scenes are often just incomprehensible."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,50,"While the visuals are lovely to behold, this unremarkable version of the classic 18th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,40,"Hollywood's latest play for the growing Asian market revisits the ancient Japanese legend of self-sacrifice, hoping to offset its garbled narrative and grinding humourlessness with 3D and Keanu Reeves as a samurai Jesus."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,40,"47 Ronin can’t entirely paper over the void at its center, traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,40,"As impressive as these visual elements prove to be, the film struggles to grab and maintain audiences’ interest, whether or not they know the underlying legend by heart."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,37,"Ultimately, the movie just doesn’t justify its outrageous bid to turn a solemn tale of self-sacrifice into swaggering global-marketplace entertainment."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,30,"Rinsch, making his feature debut, shows the shortcoming of someone coming from the image-based world of commercials and advertising. There are moments of genuine beauty and a few terrifically eye-popping effects, but no feel yet for storytelling."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,30,"It falls short on character definition, emotional involvement, narrative drive and originality."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,25,It’s a movie of pointless scenes.
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,25,"In spite of its enjoyable, easy-to-exploit aspects, 47 Ronin is a big budget spectacle hamstrung by its need to be at once flippant and respectful of its honor-driven source material."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,25,This botched vision accepts the warrior's nobility at face value and sees the story merely as a springboard for high-flying action and CGI special effects.
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"This Hungarian-shot bore is so indistinct it reeks of no place more than Hollywood, where the fascinating specifics of history and legend are ground into universal mush."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"47 Ronin is elephantine and lumbering, a wobbly, would-be epic that aspires to the scope and majesty of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but comes up woefully short."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"The basics of the story remain unchanged, but it’s the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle, be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected ""Lord of the Rings"" villains."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,20,"“I will search for you through 1,000 worlds and 10,000 lifetimes!” Reeves promises his beloved. Anyone who sits all the way through this glossy folly will know exactly how that feels."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,5,"Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly."
47 Ronin,6.3,38362475,0,"In the monumentally dull 47 Ronin, Reeves mumbles monosyllabic claptrap between dull action scenes. And it’s a shame: At almost 50 years old, the actor allows this turgid, clanky flick to play to his worst stereotypes."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"Mel Gibson is always good for a surprise, and his latest is that Apocalypto is a remarkable film. Set in the waning days of the Mayan civilization, the picture provides a trip to a place one's never been before, offering hitherto unseen sights of exceptional vividness and power."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"For those of us who prefer to judge Gibson solely in terms of his art, the movie is a virtuosic piece of action cinema -- particularly in its second half...And while there has been no shortage of recent films that decry the horrors of war and man's inhumanity to his fellow man, I know of none other quite this sickeningly powerful."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,100,"The production design is superb, and the actors deliver their dialogue in subtitled Yucatecan Maya, but despite all the anthropological drag, this is really just a crackerjack Saturday-afternoon serial."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,91,"For all its excesses, it's an absorbing, disturbing, savagely beautiful ""trip"" movie, and an extraordinary -- perhaps even outrageous -- personal vision of the one A-list filmmaker who truly deserves the adjective ""maverick."""
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,90,"Gibson may not be much of a deep thinker, but he's a heck of a storyteller. Apocalypto turns out to be not a case of Montezuma's revenge but of Gibson's: It's something entirely unexpected, a sinewy, taut poem of action."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,Gibson has made a film of blunt provocation and bruising beauty.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"Barbarously beautiful and gut-wrenchingly (literally) violent, it's a mesmerizing vision of the past refracted through the dark obsessions of the present."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"Awe-inspiring and harrowing, vile and beautiful, as wild and mesmerizing as the Mexican jungle in which it is filmed and one of the most relentlessly thrilling films of the year."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"The heart of the matter - and the viscera - is the action, and one man's determination to survive. Apocalypto is primal."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,88,"The best thing I can say about Apocalypto is that, despite belonging to an overpopulated genre, it's unlike any other movie to reach theaters this year and, because it is as visual an experience as it is visceral, it is best seen on a large screen."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,83,"The whole film is too reliant on action-movie cuts and zooms, plus James Horner's insistent score, but it's beautifully rendered and convincingly exciting."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,The guy knows how to make a heart-pounding movie; he just happens to be a cinematic sadist.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"The film is mostly successful in transporting the viewer to another age: the costumes, the body markings, the fierce Mayan masks, all feel right. And keeping the dialogue in subtitles was a smart move. Even better are the faces, which never fail to fascinate. But for all the anthropological research that went into the movie, what is Apocalypto trying to say?"
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"Apocalypto turns into the best ""Rambo"" movie ever made. The worrisome part is that Gibson doesn't think he's making a boneheaded action picture. For him, torture and vengeance are the way of the world. This is Gibsonian metaphysics."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"That is the thing about Gibson, fool that he is in other ways: he has learned how to tell a tale, and to raise a pulse in the telling. You have to admire that basic gift, uncommon as it is in Hollywood these days."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,80,"Apocalypto is a dazzling achievement. Not only does it showcase a civilization little seen on the silver screen, the film (which opens with a quote from Will Duant) also advances larger questions about the natural and unnatural life cycles of civilizations."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,78,"There's so much dark material jammed into this complicated, conflicted, challenging, and charismatic man's (Gibson) own noggin that sometimes he knows not, I think, what he's done. Here, behold, Mel Gibson has made the weirdest, most violent movie of the year."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"Say what you will about Gibson, but he's a genuine filmmaker, and Apocalypto gallops along the thin line between the deluded and the inspired with such conviction that you're yanked into its wake."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"It's possible for a despicable heart and mind to make great art. And if Gibson hasn't quite done that with Apocalypto, he's nevertheless made an impressive and engrossing film. If you choose out of hand to miss it, which is your right, you'll be missing something."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,75,"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but that sadomasochistic anti-Semite knows how to shoot a movie."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,70,Apocalypto exists solely as an action-adventure and a deft cinematic demonstration of man's capacity for cruelty. This is the true passion of Mel.
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,63,"A lotta woe to sit through, with not much to think about and only one matter to address. After the two hours-plus have sped by with brutal alacrity, all that's left is for the survivors of the bloodbath to hose down and suss out a ""new beginning."" I'm still searching for mine, but you might have better luck."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,63,"Gibson is a primitive all right, but so were Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith, and somehow we survived their idiocies."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"Neither Mr. Gibson’s fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of Apocalypto is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director’s skill."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"Dextrous with the action-adventure elements but clumsy in its handling of the central message, Apocalypto is a strange but largely entertaining mix of action, bloodletting, chin-rubbing and arthouse trimmings."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,60,"It's difficult to imagine the target audience for this film. Gangbangers, perhaps?"
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,58,"With ""Braveheart,"" ""Passion"" and now Apocalypto, Gibson clearly has established his priorities as a director. History is gore, plus a few hearthside family interludes. The trick is instilling the audience with enough rageful bloodlust to make the story work."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Numerous good things can be said about Apocalypto, the director's foray into the decaying Mayan civilization of the early 1500s, but every last one of them is overshadowed by Gibson's well-established penchant for depictions of stupendous amounts of violence."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"I could go on about the beautifully detailed production design, the fresh performances from unknown and often nonprofessional actors, blabbety blah. But praising the movie's craftsmanship seems less urgent than communicating the overwhelming experience of watching it: the clammy, claustrophobic dread of being trapped in a torture chamber."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Gibson sure knows how to shoot a sequence, but he also doesn't know when to stop with the blood, gore and maiming."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"Yet Apocalypto has to be respected for the sheer audacity of it, for the commitment and ambition behind it, and for its presentation of a complete other world. It is the furthest thing from a cynical or casual piece of work. It's crazy, and it moves."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,50,"But even those who succumb to his primitive, survivalist vision may resent the way he presents every kind of atrocity at least twice without illuminating any of the exotic details once."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,42,"Not just a walk in the park with Mel and the guys (in this case a large cast of mainly Mexican Indians speaking present- day Yucatec), this lavishly punishing picture is the third panel in Gibson's ""Ordeal"" triptych. The Martyrdom of the Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ have nothing on The Misadventures of the Jaguar Paw."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,40,"A relentlessly gruesome, visually impressive and ultimately not very interesting movie with some pretensions to seriousness."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,40,"The movie is so impressionistic, it obfuscates any sense of history. We expect at least a hint at the causes of the Mayan Empire's demise, but instead we get Mesoamerican Rambo."
Apocalypto,7.8,50866635,38,"It's ""Braveheart"" without historical significance and ""Passion"" without spirituality, though it dabbles in both, and it represents as brazen an act of career suicide as I can recall from a star director. If he were a first-timer, he'd never work again."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,75,"While most other films sprint through expository dialogue, and bluster their way through action scenes, The Last Witch Hunter is measured enough to make you want to suspend your disbelief."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,70,"The story works out like you might expect. The joys are in the way director Breck Eisner, like Diesel, is earnest about this goofiness. His direction might not showcase the full wit of the script, but it does honor its inventiveness."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,63,"It has enough ingredients for a reasonably entertaining fantasy adventure—except, that is, for an interesting lead character with an emotionally compelling hook."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,58,"It’s a shame that The Last Witch Hunter ends up crumbling into another generic showdown of murky fantasy effects and snatched artifacts, with a final shot that is literally framed around a door to possible sequels."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,50,"The Last Witch Hunter is redeemed through complex visual-effects work that aptly illuminates Goodman’s netherworld. Further, Diesel’s stolid performance is balanced through the supporting star power of Caine – even with criminally limited scenes – and Rose Leslie’s “dream walker,” whose earnestness makes even the world of a macho witch hunter seem entirely plausible."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,50,"The Last Witch Hunter feels like the first episode of a would-be series although, unlike some similar endeavors, it tells a stand-alone story."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,50,"As Kaulder, Diesel does what he does, rumbling out lines of silly dialogue in his subwoofer of a voice. As far as acting goes, there’s not much."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,50,"In its favor, The Last Witch Hunter boasts some terrific production design and digital effects.... Less impressively, Eisner’s movie is clogged with cardboard characters, flat dialogue and a sluggish middle act that gets lost in too much fabricated witchy folklore."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,45,"The Last Witch Hunter aims for pulpy, comic-book fun, but it’s never as fleet, funny, or detailed as it needs to be. And if you’re looking for something above middling in terms of plot, characters, world-building, even action sequences, you’ll need to seek it elsewhere."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,40,"Like its star, The Last Witch Hunter is big, overblown and frequently incomprehensible."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,38,The script’s messy seams also show in the parade of sidekicks that passes through Kaulder’s door as a new threat develops.
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,33,"Seemingly every time there was an opportunity to do something fun, The Last Witch Hunter runs in the other direction, creating an unfortunately heavy-handed, humorless, self-serious tone for a story that should be allowed to be a little goofy."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,30,Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,30,"The Last Witch Hunter is one of those artlessly restless, exposition-dialogue fantasy-action slogs that, thanks to Breck Eisner's untamed direction, never manages to corral all the potion talk, mythology rationale and leaps back and forth in time into anything remotely entertaining."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,30,"Director Eisner helmed the excellent remake of George R. Romero’s The Crazies back in 2010, but this film shows none of the lunatic flair for the ghastly that the previous film so easily served up."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,25,"This abortion of a thriller fails, utterly, and bombed completely. So even though there’s a “Witch Hunter 2” in development, don’t count on it."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,25,The movie left me amazed — amazed that Nicolas Cage wasn’t in it.
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,25,There are two main obstacles to enjoying The Last Witch Hunter. One is your ability to buy Vin Diesel as an immortal slayer of evildoers plying his trade in today’s Manhattan. You also have to swallow a by-the-numbers plot buried under an avalanche of fast-and-furious but underwhelming CGI effects.
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,20,"A smorgasbord of empty calories, the Vin Diesel vehicle The Last Witch Hunter, for all its overstuffed visuals, leaves you hungry. But not for more."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,20,"This is a relentlessly unengaging affair, its derivative and logic-deficient script matched by flat direction and fussy, unconvincing CGI."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,20,"There are certainly enough dopey diversions here for The Last Witch Hunter to be considerably more fun than it is, but even its most extravagant bouts of silliness are hampered by desultory plotting and Eisner’s oppressively synthetic mise-en-scene."
The Last Witch Hunter,6.0,27367660,12,"It’s just deadly and dreadful, loud and obnoxious, convoluted and irritating, horrible and dumb."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,100,"This movie is one of the most relentlessly nonstop action pictures ever made, with a virtuoso series of climactic sequences that must last an hour and never stop for a second. It's a roller-coaster ride, a visual extravaganza, a technical triumph, and a whole lot of fun."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,80,"The sustained furore of humour, visual panache and headlong momentum makes for dazzling cinema."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,80,"All in all, Spielberg has come up with another rousing piece of entertainment."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,75,"Temple of Doom doesn't so much pay tribute to the serial adventures of yore as it does embody them. Here, frivolity and evil blithely coexist—and women are a lot more likely to scream than win drinking contests."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,70,The new film is more an embellishment than an improvement on the snazzy Raiders.
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,63,"Indy's companions are weak; we don't identify with them the way we did with Marion and Sallah. There's less action and more overt comedy, and neither change works to the benefit of the story."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,63,"Watching it is like spending a day at an amusement park, which is probably what Mr. Spielberg and his associates intended. It moves tirelessly from one ride or attraction to the next, only occasionally taking a minute out for a hot dog, and then going right on to the next unspeakable experience."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,60,"The nonstop pace may eventually numb viewers to the thrills, although Spielberg must be congratulated for adding some shades of character to his archetypal action hero this time
around."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,60,"It has more complex stunts, more technical perfection, and more than a touch of genius. It's fun at both ends. But it's also mean-spirited and corrupt at its core."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,50,"Moviegoers deserve more than the racism, sexism, and all-purpose mayhem on view here - failings that offset the razor-sharp action and technical brilliance also visible."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,7.6,179870271,50,Spielberg is such a talented director it’s a shame to see him lose all sense of subtlety and nuance.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,80,This is the perfect summer movie and perhaps the best Pirates of them all.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,75,Depp and Cruz only occasionally strike the sparks expected from two of the world's most beautiful people.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,75,On Stranger Tides feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,70,Marshall delivers old-fashioned swashbuckling action-movie thrills more than computer-engineered grotesquerie.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,70,"Captain Jack Sparrow is back in excellent form for his fourth adventure in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which is more serious in the hands of a new director, Rob Marshall, and thanks to Penelope Cruz it's also a good deal sexier."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,70,"Serves as a welcome corrective, reviving the fun, feather-light frivolity that any film based on a Disneyland ride ought to exhibit."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,67,"It's a Herculean task to steal the thunder from a Johnny Depp performance, but Richard Griffiths (best known these days as Harry Potter's tubby Muggle uncle, Vernon Dursley) does exactly that."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,65,"The picture is cluttered and convoluted and big, and Marshall - taking over the reins from Gore Verbinski - doesn't seem to grasp how exhausting nonstop action can be."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,63,"Judi Dench is much more of a challenge. Drenched in powder and pomp, the grand old Dame pops up in a London carriage. She's there in a flash and then, as quickly, gone, and her fleeting presence is exactly like the fleeting merit of this fourth galleon in the portly franchise: It prompts stirrings, not quite all the way to feelings."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,63,"Best of all, here there be fun."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,63,"Frankly, the wow factor isn't that great."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,60,"Johnny Depp, back again as the swashbuckling miscreant who favors guy-liner and gold, somehow manages to keep this ship of fools afloat. But just barely."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,58,"Even the ""surprise"" appearance of Keith Richards, as the scurvy father of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, has already been hyped to death in the advance press."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"This installment, which is subtitled ""Give Us Your Money, Sheep,"" really isn't a Pirates of the Caribbean movie at all."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,I suppose you have to give credit to the movie for coming up with some badass killer mermaids.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Here's how it goes down: 4 is better than 3, about the same as 2 and worse than 1."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"As a movie, On Stranger Tides would have to be considered a failure. The story does not engage, the characters are stick figures, the action sequences are perfunctory, and the whole enterprise reeks of being a money-grab."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,Surprisingly dull.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"To press the point, there is absolutely no need for a fourth Pirates of the Caribbean."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Apart from Cruz, who throws herself lustily into her tough-seductress role, the actors give negligible performances, with McShane, Rush, and Keith Richards in a repeat cameo all playing nigh-identical smug glowerers."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Marshall deserves props for putting the ""show"" back into the Pirates business. But face it, he's polishing a giant turd."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"This is eye-catching and forgettable in the patented Bruckheimer manner, which means you should be entertained if you're not expecting anything new."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,The movie is fun until they set sail.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,On Stranger Tides isn't nearly strange enough. Its one real act of piracy is stealing away your excitement.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,50,"Repetitious, tedious, and pretty much joyless."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"Small kids won't really appreciate Johnny Depp, either, though frankly he's getting to be less fun as the series ages, possibly realizing that what's riskiest in Pirates 4 isn't walking the plank, but jumping the shark."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"It is by far the least strange of all the ""Pirates"" episodes so far, with none of the cartoonish exuberance or creepy-crawly effects that made its predecessors intermittently delightful."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"Despite Sparrow's ongoing flashes of charm, Depp himself seems to know he's coasting."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"Depp's performance is still one of the few bright spots in the movie. Richards is back, too, in an all-too-brief appearance as Sparrow's father."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"The new movie is simpler plotwise (a race to the Fountain of Youth), while at the same time being somehow more deadening."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"As the seductive and conniving Angelica, Cruz is luminous, albeit not enough to compensate for Marshall shrouding virtually every major set piece in nighttime fogginess."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,40,"An overly complicated plot and poorly thought-out characters detract from the flashes of charm that Cap'n Jack still emits. Despite quality set-pieces and the best efforts of the cast, this is dull and crossbones."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,38,On Stranger Tides has the fishy smell of something washed ashore and sold as new. But this shipwreck isn't worth a wooden doubloon.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,38,The wastrel Sparrow ends up both overexploited and underpowered in this fourth outing.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,30,I've never seen a film in which what was actually onscreen seemed so irrelevant.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,30,"For a series so steeped in supernatural mumbo-jumbo, Pirates of the Caribbean displays remarkably little sense of wonder."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,30,"The IMAX print I saw was so murky as to make you give thanks for the few scenes shot in simple sunlight, the 3-D wasn't worth the bother, and never before have I wanted to chloroform an entire orchestra."
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,25,This isn't absurdity. This is nonsense - and it's as boring as nonsense.
Kaeribianui Haejeok - Natseon Joryu,6.6,241071802,25,Even the most forgiving moviegoer will recognize this movie as the blatant cash-grab that it is.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,91,"In the end, the most impressive performance may be Spike Lee's. He uses skill without gimmickry, flash without fuss, to tap the mesmerizing soul of this pulp."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,88,"Lee’s is more of a hard-edged, hammer-and-nail noir than Park’s existential horror, and it’s far less concerned with the internal state of Joe’s mind than the external havoc it creates."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,88,It’s generally a respectful homage that has every bit as much stylishness and visual flair.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,83,"It's been so long since Lee made such a thoroughly amusing work that fans should have no problem excusing its messiness. But make no mistake... Oldboy is all over the place, sometimes playing like a subdued melodrama and elsewhere erupting into flamboyance and gore."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,75,"This American version of Park Chan-Wook's Korean thriller is Lee's most exciting movie since ""Inside Man"" — not a masterpiece by any stretch, but a lively commercial genre picture with a hypnotic, obsessive quality, and an utter indifference to being liked, much less approved of."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,75,Oldboy is an immersion into pure twistedness. The purity of its twistedness is its saving grace.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,70,"Oldboy suggests a filmmaker doing almost as much soul-searching as the main character. There is a brashness in the risks taken, the very imperfections revealing an artist finding new inspiration. For Lee, this weird, brutal film seems to have freed him."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,70,"Surprisingly, the movie doesn’t bear much of the stylistic stamp we’ve come to expect of Lee, who’s in his generic journeyman mode here. But aside from a satisfyingly clever new direction in the denouement, what distinguishes the remake from the original is its cartoonishness."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,67,"For better and worse, Lee’s Oldboy is a more somber affair."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,One of the surprises of Spike Lee’s Oldboy is just how dark the film dares to get.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,Lee’s Oldboy stands on its own. It just stands a bit shorter.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,63,"In general, Lee directs with less visual verve than Park. Anchored by Brolin, who brings an almost simian physicality to his portrayal, this Oldboy feels simultaneously less showy, less nightmarish and less epic than the original."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Oldboy is lively but numb — checked out, as if Lee were directing it following a period of intense convalescence."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Most normal people will not see this as a ""pleasant"" film -- I hope that's the case, anyway -- but it certain makes you feel something."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Watching Spike Lee’s decent but unmemorable remake of Park Chan-wook’s 2003 revenge picture ""Oldboy,"" I kept trying to figure out why he’d done it."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"If you have seen the earlier version, you can occupy yourself with point-by-point comparisons. If not, you may find yourself swerving between bafflement and mild astonishment, wondering how a movie that works so hard to generate intensity and surprise can feel so routine and bereft of genuine imagination."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Weaknesses from the original remain, including a mustache-twirling villain straight out of a Bond film (Sharlto Copley) and a Freudian master plan that unravels the more you think about it. Give credit to Lee for staying fresh, even if this feels like slumming."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"Leave it to Spike Lee to deliver one of the strangest, most off-putting movies for the Thanksgiving holiday."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,60,"While Lee leaves some of Park's more memorable outrages behind, he and screenwriter Mark Protosevich find one or two ways to up the taboo-testing ante, small surprises that retain the tale's edge without pushing into the realm of exploitation."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,58,"Lee is very good at creating a sense of free-floating dread, but he, and his screenwriter Mark Protosevich, don’t have a real flair for pulp."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,58,"Spike Lee's remake of 2003's Oldboy is as brutally perplexing as the South Korean original, and needless for both its repetition and tweaks. Nothing is really lost in translation, or gained."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"While few will debate Lee's ability as a director, this isn't close to being in his wheelhouse. Oldboy cries out for a Brian DePalma, a Quentin Tarantino, or even a David Lynch. The end result bears out the suspicion that Lee isn't right for the material, nor it for him."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"Like Martin Scorsese’s ""The Departed,"" a bloated Americanizing of the Hong Kong cop movie ""Infernal Affairs,"" the Lee Oldboy will startle newbies with its story ingenuities and morbid revelations, while leaving connoisseurs of the source film wondering why Hollywood couldn’t have left great enough alone."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,Graphically gruesome when it means to be a provocative look at vengeance.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,50,"Lee, in a sort of humorless send-up of Tarantino, substitutes kinky for mystery, explicit sex and violence for sex and violence with real shock value. When it comes to this remake, you plainly can’t teach an oldboy like Lee new tricks."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,42,"While Lee edges in enough unique elements to argue a second look at the brutal revenge tale, his lean, blackly comic result is transcendent only in fits and starts, stripping away much of its thematic and emotional heft into one of the most frustratingly accomplished disappointments this year."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"To its credit, Spike Lee’s remake isn’t a slavish imitation. On the other hand, its grit is a grey substitute for the original’s vision and verve. Disappointing."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"This one has its technical virtues, but it’s frankly kind of a muddle, and may have been doomed from the outset. I would divide the potential audience for Oldboy into two groups: Those who will be disappointed and those who will be bewildered."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"From Lee’s point of view, I can understand the enticing challenge of taking on a revered cult film Oldboy. But a pair of ill-conceived casting choices can jolt you out of the film, or worse, elicit the rolling of eyes and barely stifled giggle."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,40,"This is a very confused movie, designed for an audience that doesn’t exist."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,39,"A slumming Spike Lee is still better than most directors at the top of their game, but Oldboy isn’t just Lee’s worst movie, it’s practically his “Wicker Man”."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"The sheer brutality of Oldboy is stunning, especially a deeply disturbing scene in which Brolin tortures Samuel L. Jackson. But this is an unrelievedly grim and hermetic experience throughout, the cinematic equivalent of blunt trauma."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"What's onscreen feels squeezed, truncated and curiously embalmed. It's got no kick to it."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"The feel-bad movie of the holiday season, Spike Lee’s often-repellent Americanized reimagining of Korean director Chan-Wook Park’s twisty 2004 revenge thriller Oldboy is relentlessly gruesome, self-consciously shocking and pretty much pointless."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,The revenge in Oldboy is neither sweet nor sour; it's just drab.
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,38,"Spike Lee's version loses the one thing that really worked in the original, the sense of moral complication emerging out of the intertwined action of two men hell-bent on retribution."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,30,"His (Lee) Oldboy is relentlessly unpleasant and difficult to watch, without offering audiences much moral or aesthetic payoff for its hour and 40 minutes of graphic violence and abject degradation. Oldboy is both original and uncompromising, I’ll give it that—it just doesn’t happen to be any good."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,30,"Lee and Protosevich have made a picture that, although several shades edgier than the average Hollywood thriller, feels content to shadow its predecessor’s every move while falling short of its unhinged, balls-out delirium."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,20,"Other than sniggering about what an outré stereotype they’ve served up, it’s hard to see how Lee and Copley can justify this performance, which is quite the worst of the year, and sends the whole final act of their movie straight to oblivion."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,10,"Colorless and soulless in the extreme, it bears no one's fingerprints at all. There's no reason for this Oldboy to exist. It's so DOA, you stumble out of it wanting to eat something alive."
Oldboy,5.8,2193658,0,"The longer it drags on, the sillier it gets. A preposterous narrative, illogical red herrings, trick endings, bad acting and—shazam! — Spike Lee turns into M. Night Shyamalan!"
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,80,"Unlike Burton, Schumacher doesn't let his stylistic and thematic fascinations run away with him; he keeps one hand on the wheel at all times. The result isn't as emotionally daring and visually outrageous as Burton at his best, but it's better paced and more consistently entertaining from one sequence to the next."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"Schumacher's method is to use a lighter touch, to stay closer to the cartoon that Bob Kane created for DC Comics in 1939 and to temper Burton's nightmare world with an accessible, brightly colored TV palette."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"It's an art-direction, Dolby-sound, special-effects extravaganza, a grand-scale effort that's more awe-inspiring than completely successful as entertainment."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,75,"Although the film's frenetic rhythm is reminiscent of an ""Indiana Jones"" picture, visually Schumacher directs it like a musical, turning each image into eye candy, weaving one lush set piece into the next, as if he were the Vincente Minnelli of blockbusters."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,70,"If the first two ""Batman"" movies (1989/1992) were the storm, then Batman Forever (1995) is the rainbow at the end of it. After seeing so much dark and doom, it’s also refreshing to see some beaming color."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,70,"Working as much like a circus ringmaster as a director, Joel Schumacher has brought several critical qualities to the mix, starting with much more of a pop culture sensibility and a sense of fun than Tim Burton, who directed the first two pictures, and he has a stylish visual sensibility as well."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"There is no rhythm to the movie, no ebb and flow; it's all flat-out spectacle."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"At best, Batman Forever is mildly diverting, brainless fun that feels like a long trailer for a better film."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,63,"Carrey lights up an otherwise over-scripted, over-frenetic potboiler."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"Sometimes thrilling, but rarely inspired, it is thoroughly-almost perfectly-adequate."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"Yet while Schumacher has largely accomplished the goal of delivering a cinematic comic book, he's also left the movie hollow at its core -- a distinction that may not trouble Saturday-night audiences but that nonetheless dulls the film's impact beyond its sheer and unrelenting visual grandeur."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,60,"As for the actual movie, it's the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal (another Batman tie-in), so clearly a product that the question of its cinematic merit is strictly an afterthought."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Except for the casting, it would be difficult to find any substantial difference between this movie and the previous ones, or this movie and any number of high-tech adventure movies of the last decade."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Directed by Joel Schumacher with occasional gestures toward social commentary, and enough spectacle to mask the movie's deep down emptiness."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"The movie does have somewhat more lilt and levity, much of it due to Jim Carrey as the Riddler. But there's still plenty of murk, physical and metaphysical, and more psychobabble about Bruce Wayne's obsessions and repressions."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,"Alas, Schumacher doesn't ride on the momentum; worse, he's not an action director, and the film grinds to a dead stop every time it tries to speed up."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,50,There's so much and so little going on here simultaneously that you're not sure whether to squirm or doze.
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"Director Joel Schumacher submits to the Wagnerian bombast with an overly busy surface, and the script by Lee and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman basically runs through the formula as if it's a checklist."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"If you can see beyond the eye-scorching neon and don't mind the desecration of a superhero icon, there's a few crumbs of enjoyment to be had."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,40,"Schumacher's direction is coarse and slovenly: the picture has the self-conscious jokiness of the ""Batman"" TV series and the smudged, runny imagery of a cheaply printed comic book."
Batman Forever,5.4,184031112,20,The only thing Schumacher and his scrupulous craftsfolk forgot to give the movie was life -- the energizing spirit of wit and passion that makes scenes work and characters breathe.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,91,"Real Steel is directed by ""Night at the Museum's"" Shawn Levy, who makes good use of his specialized skill in blending people and computer-made imaginary things into one lively, emotionally satisfying story."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,80,"There's a little ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" here, a dash of ""Transformers"" there, and it's all topped with big heap of ""Rocky."" But it's hard to argue with the results, because, at times, Real Steal is close to a knockout."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"If you can get past the ridiculousness of the setup - easy to do, because the posters make it clear this isn't a Woody Allen movie - it's pretty much impossible not to have fun."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,The movie is corny enough to remind you that boxing rings are square.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"It is earsplitting, crowd-pleasing, and, no doubt, 'bot-pleasing, too. If you told me I would get emotionally and viscerally involved in two machines punching the hard drives out of each other, I would tell you you were crazy. I would be wrong."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"By the time the two hour running length has expired, it's safe to say that Real Steel comes across as a legitimate crowd-pleaser."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"Real Steel is a real movie. It has characters, it matters who they are, it makes sense of its action, it has a compelling plot. This is the sort of movie, I suspect, young viewers went to the ""Transformers"" movies looking for."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,75,"Like ""Moneyball,"" this is real movie making that packs a solid entertainment punch."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,"It goes through all the motions, properly and efficiently, and yet it's missing some core warmth. Watching Real Steel, I kept thinking of Brad Bird's retro-modern cartoon ""The Iron Giant,"" and of how that picture humanized a metal alien so effortlessly."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,"Although the marketing looks like ""Transformers 4,"" Real Steel is the real deal, a Rocky with robots that ought to have audiences standing up and cheering."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,70,The uncanny thing about Real Steel is just how gripping the fight scenes are; Sugar Ray Leonard served as a consultant to the motion-capture performers responsible for pantomiming the machines' moves.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,67,"Real Steel falls somewhere near the intersection of elation and shame, essentially reworking the Sylvester Stallone arm-wrestling non-classic ""Over The Top"" for the equally ridiculous sport of android fisticuffs, and mostly getting away with it."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,63,"If familiarity is endemic to this feel-good drama, there's nonetheless also something to be said for competent amalgamation and regurgitation of tired genre tropes."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Rocky with robots? It's not quite in Balboa's weight class, but Real Steel at least has some heft. There's barely a story beat among the beat-downs that you won't expect, and sometimes the saccharine gets in the way of the spectacle, but on the whole this is enjoyable family entertainment."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"When I was 7 and saw ""Over The Top,"" I saw no irony in its moniker, even during a slow-motion close-up of two battling hands. While Real Steel is similarly ludicrous, I predict it will play like a masterpiece with 7-year-olds."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"As it happens, this recycled reclamation of underdogs saga is neither as bad as it sounds nor quite as good as it could be."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Based very loosely on a short story by ""I Am Legend"" author Richard Matheson, Real Steel in fact comes closer to road-bonding movies featuring children and hesitant papas: ""Paper Moon"" or ""Over the Top,"" say."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,60,"Executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, the movie's special effects are seamless and far more cleanly cut than any of Michael Bay's hash. But the element that lingers longest is a subtle strand - also woven into last week's ""Take Shelter"" - of recessionary anxiety."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,58,"Real Steel is sci-fi without the science, and the fiction is strictly 20th century, straight out of Rocky knockoffs."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"The story remains sadly mired in botdom, which leads to some boredom. It's hard to look away from the ever-dazzling Jackman, but the sight of him hunched over the controls of something akin to a live action video game is not, in the end, much more exciting than the sight of your average teenager hunched over the controls of a Game Boy."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"When making a film for 10-year-old boys, it doesn't have to be good, necessarily -- just good enough. And that's exactly what Real Steel is: good enough."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"What it lacks is the human element. Charlie is more of a rat than a rascal, and instead of working hard to build and operate his robots, he's literally going through the motions."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"They should call this overloud, underwhelming movie ""Real Steal."""
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"It's a combination that seems ideal for 10-year-old boys who adore violence, and could well be the cornerstone of the next DreamWorks franchise."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"It's an odd blend - a sentimental story in a futuristic world of brutal machine-maneuvered fights. There are some ringside thrills, but it's not a seamless mesh."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"An underdog drama with clanging metal-on-metal action, Real Steel feels scientifically programmed to claw at your heart while its battling robots, which have a semblance of human personality, drum up your adrenaline. That said, I'm not sure that the movie itself has more than a semblance of a heart."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Sugar Ray Leonard helped with the motion-capture, and it shows. Good stuff. But the tear-jerking in Real Steel is as shameless as its product placement. We're being hustled."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"A slightly soggy tale of father-son bonding, crossed with an action-adventure flick about high-tech battle-bots."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,I suspect a lot of what I found synthetic and sort of galling in Real Steel will work just fine with the target audience.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Lost's Evangeline Lilly remains lost, however, in this film role as Charlies's too-good-to-be-true romantic interest."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,"Jackman gamely does his best,  Levy keeps the kid just shy of insufferable and just this side of kid-appropriate in his behavior and language."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,50,This punishingly predictable tale will test whether sci-fi action fanboys can stomach having their cherished genre infiltrated by sentimental hokum about a down-on-his-luck dad and his spunky long-lost son.
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,40,"In either a stunningly brave or misguided act of meta-absurdity, Real Steel, which is about a boy, his dad and the robot that changes their lives, actually feels as if it were made inside the mind of a kid obsessed with robots."
Real Steel,7.1,85468508,38,"Real Steel is to action what the Anthony Weiner habit was to sex: It's so virtual, so distant from the thrill, that you wonder what the point is. Do you really want to pay to watch an actor playing a kid who in turn plays what amounts to a video game?"
The Rock,7.4,134069511,88,"A first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,88,It's a popcorn-movie deluxe.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,78,"The Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies, a ridiculously overblown summer testosterone blowout right down to the Wagnerian strains of the soundtrack and its stunningly high body count. It's also a hell of a lot of fun."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"The borrowings from other movies, going all the way back to the car chase in 1968's Bullitt, are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"Although not as expertly-crafted as ""Die Hard"" or ""Speed,"" The Rock is exhausting in its own right -- and that's just one of several convincing reasons to see this film."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"A raucous, in-your-face, commando-style action thriller that makes provocative use of Alcatraz as a lunatic's lair and San Francisco as a sitting duck."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,75,"Bay has two great assets in Connery and Cage. The special effects give The Rock a James Bondian feel so Connery's wry, world-weary devil-may-careishness looks right at home here."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie Mission: Impossible should have been."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"High-octane nonsense but gives both the actors and the audience all that's needed to make this diverting--car chases, wisecracks, narrow escapes, explosions."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"Seldom is it clearer that a film is nothing more than high-gloss jokey escapism, or that when visual cliches are this relentless they become weirdly fascinating in their own right."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,70,"This is a pure popcorn picture that benefits heavily from its trio of highly skilled, charismatic leading thesps, an unusual setting that provides plenty of visual stimulation, and a confrontational standoff that actually stems from a legitimately provocative premise."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,67,Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage inject tasty bits of personality into their roles.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,63,"Connery and Cage are a compelling team and redeem the film from ruin despite the mechanical plot, an excessive body count and a miraculous recovery (you'll know it when you see it)."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,63,[Cage] cracks wise throughout the third act and is almost entertaining enough to make this absurdly energetic movie recommendable.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"Cage proves his versatility as the reluctant hero (designed by way of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character), bringing his comic timing and droll face into perfect pitch. His first scene with Connery is giddy fun. He steals the entire picture."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"Slick and forceful, largely unconcerned with character, eager for any opportunity to pump up the volume both literally and metaphorically, The Rock is the kind of efficient entertainment that is hard to take pleasure in."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"The presence of Connery is pure balm, purring those Celtic tones like smoky single-malt Scotch."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,The Rock is just typical big American dumb fun.
The Rock,7.4,134069511,50,"If it's not the most awful thing I've ever seen, it's close enough to make me wince."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"A violence-intoxicated, far-fetched, morally corrupt drama."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"It's an action junkie's angry fix -- 130 minutes of sound and fury, signifying nothing but big bucks and boundless contempt for viewer intelligence."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,40,"If, at odd moments, The Rock is better than tolerable, it is usually because of its stars."
The Rock,7.4,134069511,30,"Can a mild-mannered toxicologist and an eccentric Alcatraz veteran stop him before it's too late? Learning the answer means sitting through more than two hours of violence, vulgarity, and all-around excess, served up with high-tech trimmings by director Michael Bay."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,80,The delight of this awesome thriller is simply that Schwarzenegger--an old hand at this sort of running-around-shooting-henchmen thing--could easily sleepwalk through the movie...but he doesn't.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,"Spottiswoode and Schwarzenegger deliver a clever and colorful conspiratorial thriller with high-energy action scenes, car crashes a go-go, spectacular technology and big explosions, packaged with ferocious glee and spoofing humor. Who could ask for more from Ah-nold?"
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,This movie knows how to entertain.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,A well-crafted entertainment containing enough ideas to qualify it as science fiction and not just as a futurist thriller.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,Well worth the price of admission.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,75,"A fun ride. It's loud and obvious, but it's also the first high-tech, sci-fi thriller to think through some of the implications of cloning and capitalism."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,A clever but routine science fiction flick.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,"A bit of a clone itself, but it's got a crackerjack helicopter chase, a semblance of a script, and a sotto voce performance by Robert Duvall as a biotech genius who murmurs sweet nothings to his dying cloned wife."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,70,"Offers high-speed helicopter chases, fireballing explosions, deadly laser guns, futuristic technology gone amok, multiple car crashes, two Arnold Schwarzeneggers for the price of one - almost everything except a plot that makes sense."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,67,"The movie isn't ""Blade Runner,"" but it's got some provocative ideas about the implications of cloning in a market-driven, capitalist society."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,A mostly standard-issue latter-day Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner spiked with a creepily plausible cloning angle.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,Plays like something picked up at a vintage store; you can see all the greasy fingerprints from those who have handled it before.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,"This movie is a clone itself, a far cry from ""Total Recall"" but vastly superior to ""End of Days."""
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,63,"Like Schwarzenegger himself, it looks tired, and a little bored."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,60,"Edited like the world's most expensive car ad. The screen opens and closes like a nervous accordion, and the action shifts speeds like crazy."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,60,"From its standard-issue action to its halfhearted dialogue and acting, that's one situation even two Schwarzeneggers aren't enough to solve."
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Offers director Roger Spottiswoode a chance to have the worst actor in Beverly Hills play scenes with himself.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Achieves a level of hypocrisy astounding less for its brazenness than for its sheer stupidity.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,It's mediocrity at its most unremarkable.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Neither smart nor exciting enough to justify the effort.
The 6th Day,5.9,34604280,50,Another droning formulaic thriller.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,88,"A refreshing summer cocktail of action-movie staples, The Wolverine combines the bracingly adult flavor of everyone’s favorite mutant antihero — tortured, boozy X-Man Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine — with the fizzy effervescence of several mixers from the cabinet of Japanese genre cinema: noirish yakuza crime drama, samurai derring-do and ninja acrobatics."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,83,The movie's a solid fish-out-of-water thriller that just happens to be populated by a few folks with adamantium skeletons or poison saliva on their résumés.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,83,"If comic book movies are the last place you look for a soulful, serious performance, The Wolverine should be your first."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,80,"Taken on its own terms The Wolverine is the cleanest, least pretentious and most satisfying superhero movie of the summer."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,80,"The Wolverine boasts one of the best pulp-inspired scripts yet. It’s still full of corny dialogue...but there’s a genuine elegance to the way it establishes Logan’s tortured condition and slowly brings the character around to recovering his heroic potential, methodically setting up and paying off ideas as it unfolds."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"As a consolidated character piece threaded with a popcorn-munching action picture, The Wolverine is solid."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"The post-conversion 3D is more distracting than anything else, but the rest of this surprisingly fun entertainment is as sharp as the hero’s claws."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Mangold front-loads the action, but near the end there’s a first-rate fight atop a bullet train between Wolverine/Logan and some especially pesky ninjas. It puts the train fights in the recent “The Lone Ranger” to shame."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"It has such a strong aesthetic about it, it's almost as if The Wolverine functions as its own stand-alone film, rather than as a piece of the ""X-Men"" mythology."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Whether or not this flies in the unforgiving fan world remains to be seen. But for those less intemperately invested, The Wolverine will come as a welcome and bracing surprise: An almost human-scaled superhero movie about a guy who goes to die in Japan and ends up beating his way back to life."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"The Wolverine is one of the better comic-book movies of 2013, thanks in large part to an electric performance by Hugh Jackman."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"The Wolverine shows that, while originality would be nice, a little novelty and enthusiasm in the presentation of the familiar can be quite enough."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Apart from Khodchenkova, who displays the acting acumen of a runway model and gives new meaning to the term Russian mole (she's the villainous vixen of the tale, suited up in high heels and slinky, scaly couture), the cast of The Wolverine is uniformly good."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,Finally - a superhero movie that doesn't feel like every other superhero movie.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"It's simply a more focused scenario than usual, full of violence done up with a little more coherence and visceral impact than usual."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,Jackman spends enough time compellingly playing stranger in a strange land that you’ll put up with a few unwanted doses of the old familiar.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,75,"Now here’s a comic-book movie. In a summer that’s delivered one overstuffed Phase Two sequel and a bloated reboot designed to establish a whole new universe of interconnected franchises, The Wolverine has a self-contained efficiency that’s hard to resist."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,70,"As much as director James Mangold’s cinematic interpretation had going for it prior to pre-production, it’s a pity it only seldom succeeds—largely due to the decisions made way back before Darren Aronofsky was attached to helm."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,70,"A modest superhero picture may sound like a contradiction in terms, but really it is a welcome respite."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,70,Let all Marvel franchises have as long a life as Logan. But could Singer let Jackman sing a few numbers as the knife-fingered mutant? They could call it Les Scissorables.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,67,You have to hand it to Marvel for managing to leave audiences breathless in anticipation of a sequel after making them sit through two-plus hours of merely satisfactory storytelling.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"An intermittently exciting action film anchored by a strong performance by Jackman, who embodies Wolverine like no one else could."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,I liked that The Wolverine (which saves a nifty twist for a surprise scene in the middle of the end credits) turns down the volume on the usual din of colliding mutant superpowers.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"This pissed-off man of Adamantium claws is stalking new ground (Japan), and his fight with yakuza on top of Tokyo's speeding bullet train is a wowser."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"This may be the year's best superhero movie because, for a sufficient amount of time, it doesn't feel like a superhero movie at all."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,63,"This Wolverine gets our hopes up, and falls short."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"Unsurprisingly, Jackman is as perfect for Wolverine as he was when he first played the character 13 years ago. Convincing whether going berserk on a troublesome ninja or showing Logan's inner turmoil, he's a commanding presence throughout and, as you might expect, is the film's engine."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,It exists in fits and starts: a Blade Runner–esque moment of rainy contemplation on a hotel balcony; some weird sexual tension with a lizard girl (statuesque Svetlana Khodchenkova) who steals away Wolverine’s healing powers.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"The Wolverine is an erratic affair, more lumbering than compelling, an ambitious film with its share of effective moments that stubbornly refuses to catch fire."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,The lack of plot coherence is a lingering irritant in a film that otherwise seems to be trying to improve on its cinematic-series forebears.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,The filmmakers work at creating a new take on an old protagonist and then don’t really have much new to do with him once they’ve achieved that. It’s a good effort. Just not an entirely successful one.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"Until a third act that collapses in a harebrained heap, the director largely succeeds in keeping the more cartoonish aspects at bay, roughing up the surface with organically staged fight scenes and, crucially, raising the stakes by stripping his hitherto indestructible hero of his self-healing powers."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,An improvement on the last outing for Jackman’s not-so-merry mutant. If only it trusted enough in its unique setting to forgo a descent into aggressively awful formula.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,60,"It’s a step up from the garbled silliness of Wolverine’s first solo outing. Unlike Origins, the storytelling is more sharply focused here, ignited by flashes of stylised superheroism."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"Slapped with the generic title The Wolverine, the fifth feature-length appearance of Hugh Jackman’s X-Man John Logan is basically ""The Bad News Wolverine Goes to Japan"" and is not especially world-shaking."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"I'd like to credit Mangold, along with writers Christopher McQuarrie, Mark Bomback and Scott Frank for their good intentions; the smaller scope and lighter tone of their film is a tonic after bloated doom and gloom of ""Man of Steel."""
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,The mediocre mushy stuff isn’t alleviated by enough action.
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"The Wolverine—despite being an improvement on Gavin Hood’s muddled 2009 X-Men Origins: Wolverine—isn’t worthy of Jackman’s gifts. It’s a reasonably engaging summer diversion, a semi-rousing adventure that doesn’t make you feel robbed of two hours of your life."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,50,"This is Jackman’s show entirely, and he’s as forceful and charismatic as ever as the walking, talking hurt that is Wolverine. If only he had something more interesting to do here."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,42,"It’s rare that a movie stops making sense before anyone speaks a line of intelligible dialogue, but The Wolverine is a rare movie."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,42,"The Wolverine wants to have it both ways: a dark character story and an action-packed superhero film. But it never reconciles the two notes, and thus becomes more and more atonal as it wobbles towards its symphonically jarring ending."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"Good thing the Aussie star has the role down to a science, since the rest of  The Wolverine is a howler."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"This turgid return papers over the previous film’s narrative, but creates little in the way of a fresh character arc."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"The flat hammerblows of The Wolverine bear little relation to the zing and pop of Matthew Vaughn's colourful treatment. Inconsistency is inevitable in a world that's constantly being dug up and done over, but it leaves us no time to fall in love with anything being flung at us."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,40,"The previous X-Men film, First Class, was secure enough in its own skin to embrace its comic side. Mangold’s picture affects a pubescent snarl instead: that’s the difference between comic and daft."
The Wolverine,6.7,132556852,31,"The Wolverine reveals itself to be a film in desperate need of a point, in dire need of consequences and in a wandering search of any semblance of emotional weight."
In Time,6.7,37520095,100,"Coming now, today, In Time is not just satisfying. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's important, because that would overstate it, but it certainly feels like part of the national conversation. It arrives in theaters at a time when people are camped out in New York saying the same things as the people in the movie. It's weird the way films often anticipate the near future."
In Time,6.7,37520095,90,"In Time has so much style and energy that it comes across as an act of boldness rather than just a liberal-minded tract, though of course, it's that too. If there were ever a movie made for the 99 percent, this is it."
In Time,6.7,37520095,75,"To my thinking, the grand simplicity of the metaphor is a big part of In Time's oddly retro sci-fi charm. Niccol is practicing the old-school craft of making a barn-broad alternate-reality that forces you to think about the way we all consensually agree to participate in systems -- even when those systems are hopelessly screwed up."
In Time,6.7,37520095,75,"Justin Timberlake continues to demonstrate that he is a real actor, with screen presence. But after the precise timing and intelligence he brought to ""The Social Network,"" it's a little disappointing to find him in a role that requires less. He has a future in the movies."
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,"A pleasing, often rousing movie for the 99 percent, In Time is not without flaws."
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,Clever and unsettling.
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,"It's a fascinating philosophical conceit delivered as a slick, hyper-stylized conspiracy yarn, juicy enough to deliver on both fronts, provided you don't ask too many questions."
In Time,6.7,37520095,70,"So, yeah - even if In Time descends from its gripping and thought-provoking premise into a mediocre chase thriller before it's over, it's still pretty damn satisfying to watch in the current climate."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"The problem with In Time, to the extent that it is a problem, is that an intriguing premise turns into window dressing for a somewhat routine ""Bonnie & Clyde""-meets-""Robin Hood"" action thriller with car chases, heists, and gunplay."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"Along the way there are definitely some pleasing distractions, just not enough to obscure the growing realization that a much better picture could have been made, and wasn't. Many films never have a chance, but this one did – it's an opportunity wasted."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"All in all, In Time is not just stylish but surprisingly substantial. From now on, you'll think twice every time you hear the phrase ""rollover minutes."""
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"In Time has about 50 minutes of good movie in it. Alas, the sci-fi thriller runs nearly twice that length, and despite a terrific concept that could make for an ""Inception"" for 2011, we get ""Logan's Run"" meets ""Robin Hood."" And not the good parts."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"I like a lot of the film despite its drawbacks; its violence isn't rote or numbing, and there's a simplicity and elegance to the digital-countdown effect."
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"""Gattaca"" director Andrew Niccol's sense of the zeitgeist is as on the money as ever with In Time, a sci-fi parable that plays like ""Occupy Wall Street: The Movie."""
In Time,6.7,37520095,63,"If you can overlook the lack of logic inherent in its central conceit, In Time makes for a fun, stylish piece of speculative sci-fi."
In Time,6.7,37520095,60,"The pace is solid and engaging without putting you on the edge of your seat-you won't be looking at your watch, which means it's at least worth the time spent."
In Time,6.7,37520095,60,"The tick tick tock of the mortal clock gives the science-fiction thriller In Time its slick, sweet premise."
In Time,6.7,37520095,58,"The movie, I'm sad to report, has a majorly disappointing follow-through. It turns into a noisy, squalling chase movie."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,It's a great idea that Niccol can't translate into a great movie.
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"The writer-director Andrew Niccol is best known for writing ""The Truman Show,"" another movie that got carried away by doomsday deep-think. The deep-think here is even sillier."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"After a nifty setup, In Time mostly fails to deliver as it gets lamer by the minute."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"Andrew Niccol's In Time looks great, sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"What's missing are the kind of moments that actually matter, the ones that are so gripping that you want desperately for time to stop - to savor them, to feel the fear, the passion, the regret. Ah, well … maybe next time."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,Pretty cast. Potent  premise. Piss-poor execution. And so dies In Time.
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"The movie tries to do for forearms what the loosely similar science-fiction romance ""The Adjustment Bureau'' attempted for men's hats: make them chic."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,In Time is that kind of movie: Philip K. Dick for knuckleheads.
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"Much like Niccol's ""Gattaca,"" in which genetic perfection rather than time was the weapon a small group of snobby, unworthy elites used to hold down the meek masses, In Time is a chilly, stiff movie where clever ideas are delivered as self-righteous sermons."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"As novel and absorbing as In Time is in several respects, however, Andrew Niccol's latest conception of an altered but still recognizable future feels undernourished in other ways that are not as salutary, preventing the film from fulfilling its strong inherent promise."
In Time,6.7,37520095,50,"Justin Timberlake can't elevate what amounts to relatively simplistic, formulaic material, but his headlining turn exhibits sufficient charisma and wit to make In Time a passably diverting action-packed waste of time."
In Time,6.7,37520095,40,Niccol's attempts at satire are toothless.
In Time,6.7,37520095,40,"Niccol's bizarrely stilted sci-fi thriller In Time, a movie so consistently flat-footed, with pauses between lines of dialogue so vast, that you begin to wonder if the whole thing might be a psychological experiment of some kind...Or has he just made a really dull movie?"
In Time,6.7,37520095,40,"Kartheiser brings some zip and smarm to the proceedings as the villain with a million years in his vault, but it's not nearly enough to make In Time worth your time. Or your money."
In Time,6.7,37520095,38,This future looks awfully passé: The stimulus didn't work out. Neither did 1917 Russia.
In Time,6.7,37520095,20,"They have some fun playacting at class warriors on the lam – and Seyfriend, it must be said, rocks a killer bob – but it's all just big-budget dress-up in a futurescape that reeks of phoniness."
In Time,6.7,37520095,20,"Sadly, for 99% of its running time, this muddled sci-fi drama is filled with enough overplotting, bad acting and riddle-speak dialogue to stop a clock."
In Time,6.7,37520095,16,Niccol fashioned an uninspired and downright dull sci-fi gimmick and doesn't even explain how it happened.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,88,"Beyond the visuals, what makes The Maze Runner so compelling is its attention-grabbing storyline."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,78,"Even if it doesn’t manage to be quite the ""Hunger Games""-level hit its producers would clearly desire, it’s the best of the wannabes we’ve seen so far."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Director Wes Ball makes a solid feature film debut, without any noticeable video game envy to his action sequences."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Using a refreshingly gentle FX touch, Ball has successfully transposed the decaying, vine-covered concrete jungle look of his short onto this gorgeously-designed feature. The neophyte knows how to direct heart-pumping chase scenes and has coaxed surprisingly solid performances from his young ensemble cast, especially O’Brien and Poulter."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Director Wes Ball doesn't have much experience with actors, but for once that's a plus; his background is in animation and art direction, and the design of the maze (brutal slabs of concrete and steel) and the attacks by the spiders (""Predator""-like clicks, then stabbing violence) make the movie gruesomely watchable."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"As incomplete as the narrative is, The Maze Runner delivers on almost every other level."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,First-time feature director Wes Ball's version of The Maze Runner makes the cliches smell daisy-fresh.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"If you’re going to treat your audience like a rat in a maze, it’s best to offer a tastier reward than the promise of more maze to come."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,75,"Wes Ball's background is in animation and effects, and he certainly has an eye for composition. Thankfully, he doesn't just lean on visual flash in his debut feature, the adaptation of the first of James Dashner's four books, and his skills allow him to build a convincing world around his appealing cast without losing them in it completely."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,72,"For a genre that so often sacrifices character development and smaller narrative developments, the majority of The Maze Runner feels quite refreshing and worth the navigation."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,70,"The Maze Runner only answers some of the questions it so marvelously sets up. And while I probably now know too much about the story for it to work a similar magic next time, I find myself genuinely anticipating the next one."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,67,"The first two-thirds of The Maze Runner are a clever feat of fantasy world building. It's thrilling, twisty, and as mysterious as the mammoth Skinner Box environment the film takes place in. But the promising set-up raises so many puzzle-piece questions that when it's all finally explained in the final reel, you can't help feeling a bit gypped."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,63,"It's bleak business, and as it hurries toward its explosive, expository conclusion, the film becomes nonsensical, too."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,63,"What’s intriguing about The Maze Runner – for a long time, at least – is the way it tells us a story we think we’ve heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,63,"A curious blend of our newly acquired taste for dystopia alongside a healthy sprinkling of Lord of the Flies, the film offers familiar pleasures without prompting the sense of having already been here before."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"Entertaining but never quite thrilling, this actually feels like the second film in a franchise, coasting along, but saving the best bits for the next episode."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"It’s a well-made adventure with great energy and considerable style, but it’s essentially a maze without an exit."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,It's also both intense and entertaining enough to leave audiences hungry for the inevitable sequel so clearly set up by its cliffhanger ending.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"No, there’s nothing new here. But sometimes it’s enough to be merely entertained, rather than amazed."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"By establishing some of the Glade’s castes, rituals, and personalities, the writers make an incredibly contrived scenario seem a little more tangible. But once that high gear is engaged, the IQ and ambition drop precipitously."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"Aside from some uneven handling of the cast, Ball competently styles the action sequences throughout the film and capitalizes on his VFX expertise with pulse-pounding scenes tracking the Runners through the Maze battling Grievers."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,60,"As world-creation YA pictures go, The Maze Runner feels refreshingly low-tech and properly story-driven."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,55,"For its first half or so, The Maze Runner tells a captivating tale of survival and weaves a potentially interesting mystery. Once its path become clear, however, you realize this is a puzzle you've worked out before."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"Despite a strong opening and riveting first 45 minutes, The Maze Runner devolves into one of the weakest post-apocalyptic Young Adult movies to reach theaters in recent years."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"The Maze Runner isn’t based on a video game, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. In it, our hero must lead his comrades through a dingy gray concrete maze while dodging cyborg monsters, and it all looks like every gaming trailer you’ve ever seen."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"Ball tends to slice and dice action sequences in a way that drains them of energy, and his attempts to churn up emotion fall disconcertingly flat. But he does stage a couple of effective adrenaline-pumping chases through the maze's industrial wasteland."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,A perfectly serviceable entry in the young-adult dystopian sweepstakes.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,Maze Runner feels only partially formed.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,50,"Think “Lord of the Flies,” without all the jerks."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,40,The Maze Runner is so bleak that it almost convinces us to take it seriously.
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,40,"The look of the film is impressive enough, but the performances are merely OK. The same goes for the story."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,40,"The Maze Runner is not a good movie, but it wins points for omitting much of what makes typical teen films excruciating."
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,38,"The resolution to this puzzle is so botched it’s insulting, as if they’re daring us to laugh at the notion that this is merely “the beginning.”"
The Maze Runner,6.8,102427862,25,"Fans of the novel might get some minor thrills from the big screen adaptation, but it's hard to understand what made the material so popular in the first place."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,83,"In terms of pure pop entertainment value, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more smartly constructed, beautifully shot, pulse-pounding movie this holiday season."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,80,"Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise deliver on their promise, with a witty, violent take on Reacher that makes up for its lack of height with an abundance of smarts and thrills."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,80,Tom Cruise is in fine form as mysterious tough guy Jack Reacher finally reaches the big screen.
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,80,"A superior thriller, with Cruise and McQuarrie slotting together like a bullet in a clip. Like Reacher on the firing range, the aim isn't always true – but the misses are fractional."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,75,"Werner Herzog, better known as one of the finest living directors, plays a bad guy with Teutonic relish. If he doesn't watch it, he'll have a whole other career for himself playing dead-eyed villains."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,75,"Cruise's Jack Reacher is a loner who doesn't smile, charm, love the ladies, aim his index fingers to the heavens or sing ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" in bars. Here he just snarls and kills people. Yes, please, and let's have more of the same."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,75,"This is Cruise's show. And he nails it. The patented smile is gone, replaced by a glower that makes Jack Reacher a dark and dazzling ride into a new kind of hell."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,70,"If you're looking for something lean and unpretentious, you should be pretty satisfied."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,70,"Cruise is definitely too short for the gig, but in this first fight, he proves his tough-guy chops. Outraged Reacher readers can stand down."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,70,"This violent, sometimes brutal suspense thriller was thus quite a surprise, both in how effectively Cruise creates a commanding physical presence despite his lack of size, and for how well the film works in general."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,67,"The bigger problem is that Cruise, as Reacher, has no wit and no style, other than the studiously applied kind. He's so desperate to do everything right that nearly everything he does comes off all wrong."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,65,"Beat by beat, Jack Reacher is just like Child's paperbacks in the best possible way: it's fast, fun, and smarter than it looks."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,65,McQuarrie... is a real writer; his banter has snap and bite. His directorial skills are still catching up with his writing skills; the movie loses steam in the final half-hour.
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,63,Outrageous but entertaining pulp-melodrama thriller.
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,60,"Cruise's tightly controlled performance holds our attention all the way through to the tense finale. Still, McQuarrie's script never gets at the heart of a character who's already inspired such a passionate fan base."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,60,"That Cruise fails to make a case for Reacher's allure, though, has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film's inability - stupefying inability, really - to otherwise make a case for the character's originality in a movie so choked with visual clichés and dreadfully moldy dialogue."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,58,"Despite a terrific cast, Jack Reacher comes up empty-handed."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"The whole movie is like an NRA wet dream, with Robert Duvall as a crusty gun-range owner who pitches in to shoot bad guys. Jack Reacher already feels as if it belongs to another era."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,Jack Reacher has the distinction of being little more than it initially appears to be: a clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie that offers little more than every other clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie.
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"World-weariness is not really the energetic star's best driving gear. Nor are declarations of menace intended to identify Jack Reacher as a modern-day mythic avenger. When he tells an enemy, through his clenched choppers, ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot,"" the effect is, unintentionally, popcorn-spitting funny. Talk about overreaching."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"An average action film, made slightly better by Cruise, and more bizarre by Herzog, and more watchable by Pike, but still within the average range, a silk purse that still says oink."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,This movie is the height of by-the-book dullness.
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"Reacher is so good at everything he does, and Cruise plays him in such a robotic manner, that the movie becomes a bit of a bore: The hero is practically omnipotent."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"In the movie version at least, efforts to render the hero larger than life result in a story that is less than convincing."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"Even when the film is cool, it manages to be wrong."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day, but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded, and his fans likely won't appreciate the stretch."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,50,"Jack Reacher isn't much of a man, and Jack Reacher isn't the story of a man. It's mythmaking for self-satisfied sociopaths."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,42,"Whether blithely comparing American prisons to retirement homes or gleefully recalling the time he chewed off his own fingers in Siberia, the moonlighting German New Wave auteur injects some much-needed black humor into what is otherwise a soporific star vehicle."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,40,"So thrill-less, so chill-less is Jack Reacher that it is unlikely to spark interest, much less controversy."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,40,"Apart from the car chase, the only real fun in Jack Reacher comes from Mr. Herzog and Robert Duvall, called in near the end for some marvelously gratuitous scenery chewing as a gruff former Marine. They enliven the movie's atmosphere of weary brutality for a few moments, but they also call attention to the dullness of their dramatic surroundings."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,40,"Jack Reacher is a wildly ill-advised miscalculation, with Cruise's virtually unstoppable appeal butting uncomfortably against Reacher's alternately cocky and downright crude cynicism."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,38,"The violence is plenty, and pointless."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,38,"The film is as incompetent, manipulative, safe, and disposable as any number of nickel-and-dime actioners, but goes to great, unconvincing lengths to insist it's different."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,25,"Jack Reacher is mostly grim, violent and stupid."
Jack Reacher,7.0,80070736,25,"Jack Reacher, which Christopher McQuarrie directed from his adaptation of a Lee Child crime novel, is not just another dumb thriller. It's almost peerlessly self-important, weirdly incoherent and eerily smarmy. It's also mysteriously inept, considering that Tom Cruise plays the title role."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,70,"Live and Let Die borrowed from blaxploitation; The Man with the Golden Gun took a couple of kicks at kung fu, though in a distinctly half-hearted fashion."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,63,"Rarely does The Man with the Golden Gun take anything seriously. Mary Goodnight is as clumsy as they come. Pepper and Nick Nack are cartoonish. There are more jokes-per-minute than in any other Bond film. Even John Barry's score is less earnest than usual, and the opening song is ridiculous."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,60,Whilst this takes itself a little too lightly it has a lot going for it.
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,60,"Enjoyment requires denying the increasingly problematic truth about Bond: As heroes go, 007 represents a bygone notion of the privileged white man taking what’s his and leaving destruction in his wake."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,50,"Roger Moore already seems winded in his second outing as Bond. And the film's comedic approach to martial arts justly rankles true 007 afficionados. Compensation comes in the form of Christopher Lee's delicious take on evil as Scaramanga and Herve Villechaize's verve as Nick Nack, Scaramanga's dwarf manservant."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Mr. Moore functions like a vast garden ornament. Pedantic, sluggish on the uptake, incapable of even swaggering, he's also clumsy at innuendo. If you enjoyed the early Bond films as much as I did, you'd better skip this one."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond is blandness personified. It is left to Christopher Lee, playing a kind of Westernised, Dracula-esque Fu Manchu, to lend some semblance of style and suavity as Scaramanga, the man with a hideout in Red China and a hankering after the status of gentleman."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,Roger Moore is a pastry chef's idea of James Bond; but Christopher Lee as the archetype of the evil antagonist makes this 007 outing just about bearable.
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,"Screenwriters Maibaum and Mankiewicz attempted to downplay the gadgetry this time around, but their attempts at adding more humor hinder plot development. The film's pace lags until the climactic finale."
The Man with the Golden Gun,6.8,20972000,40,Roger Moore's second outing as 007 does not do the subject matter justice. Or the character. Or any paying member of the audience.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,100,"Bold and stirring with impeccable production values, The Last of the Mohicans is a memorable motion picture adventure, and one of the best films of the year."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,100,"The first hour of The Last of the Mohicans plays like a convoluted history lesson. I appreciate that Mann has enough respect for the audience's intelligence to sketch in this briar patch of conflicting loyalties. But he outlines the interlocking factions without really making it clear, in dramatic terms, what each one stands for."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,90,"When this historical adventure kicks in, it's thrilling in the way old-fashioned epics used to be, but its romanticism has a fierce, violent physicality that gives it a distinctively modern stamp."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,88,[The Last of the Mohicans] blends pure adventure with a compelling central romance.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,83,"The Last of the Mohicans is a striking mixture of the ersatz and the genuine. In other words, it’s vintage Hollywood. It’s also a smashingly entertaining and satisfying adventure."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"Mann, who's best known for such urban crime dramas as ""Vice"" and ""Manhunter,"" is equally at home whether the chase concerns a cigarette boat or a birch-bark canoe. He brings the same flair pairing action and style to The Last of the Mohicans, an attempt to resurrect and redefine the American hero."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans isn't a classic, but it's one of the most exciting action pictures to come along in recent memory."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans rarely flinches in depicting the eye-for-an-eye savagery of war. Although not explicit in the way you might expect, it nevertheless requires you to screw your courage to the sticking place. Perhaps that's a tribute to its ability to take you along its journey without much effort – real enough to elicit a visceral reaction, romantic enough to remind you it's only a movie."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,The Last of the Mohicans is not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be -- more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit -- but it is probably more entertaining as a result.
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"Drawing upon the novel with merciful selectivity, and adding such a contemporary flavor that the film's woodsmen often have a laid-back air, Michael Mann has directed a sultrier and more pointedly responsible version of this story."
The Last of the Mohicans,7.8,75505856,80,"The Last of the Mohicans comes at you like a tomahawk. Hard, fast and brutal, it slashes at your throat and just about leaves you for dead. Undeniably exciting as this definitely is, however, its impact comes at the expense of some of the gentler virtues, qualities that even top-drawer barn-burners really shouldn't ignore."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,100,"Most astonishingly, with the franchise's powerful climax, Lawrence has managed to align her parallel Hollywood lives and reinvent the prestigious popcorn flick, a crowd-pleaser with intelligent class."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,91,"This may be one of the most subversive blockbusters I can name, and I respect just how raw Francis Lawrence and his team play things. Even the ""action"" in the film is grim and painful and rarely thrilling."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,90,"What makes the material still feel personal — other than the yearslong investment and love that transform entertainments into fan communities — is the combination of Katniss and Ms. Lawrence, who have become a perfect fit."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,90,This is a film that dares to be about something while still delivering as a piece of straightforward entertainment.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,83,"Lawrence makes every moments as Katniss count, pouring out mixed feelings through puffy eyes."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"The final film adaptation of Suzanne Collins’s dystopian Hunger Games YA novels, Mockingjay — Part 2, is a potent antiwar saga: bleak, savage, and very modern in the depiction of an unholy union between political manipulation and showbiz."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2 is a dark film, in a dramatically satisfying way."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"After the subterranean sluggishness of the last film, too thinly spun out from the first third of Suzanne Collins’s final book, Mockingjay – Part 2 returns the series to its characteristic high gear."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"If anything, this is too faithful to the book, sometimes getting bogged down in detail as Katniss struggles to her goal. But its epic sweep, grand designs and unyielding central performance make this a compelling finale."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,Jennifer Lawrence shines once again in a fitting send-off for cinema’s best YA franchise. The hefty action and high stakes outweigh any shortcomings.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"In the genuinely shocking and surprising third act, it wades deep into the moral shades of grey at the story's core and comes out the other side with no easy solution."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"This might be the most downbeat blockbuster in memory, a film that starts out pitiless and goes downhill from there, save for a fleeting glimmer of hope in the final moments. It’s a bold statement about the unforgiving nature of war, unashamedly political in its motives and quietly devastating in its emotional effect."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,80,"Mockingjay — Part 2 proves to be the most satisfying, gripping and emotional film in the franchise, resolving Katniss Everdeen’s odyssey with tense action sequences and a well-earned poignancy."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"“If we die, let it be for a cause, not a spectacle,” the heroine barks at one point. If such a statement sounds fairly insane coming from a series that has grossed (to date) $2.3 billion worldwide, Mockingjay — Part 2 is sturdy enough to render it moot while you’re watching. After that, it’s up to you whether to swallow the irony or choke on it."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"The good news is that Mockingjay – Part 2, the big finale, has quit the ass-dragging in favor of what made the book a page-turner. There's the visual fireworks, for sure. But there's also the darkness of the theme."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"An exciting, involving finale, streamlining the complicated end game of Collins’ story without shortchanging the climactic action."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"Mockingjay — Part 2 is a grim, dark, trippy, violent and sometimes just plain bizarre journey, which makes for a fitting if uneven conclusion to a film series that’s always been weird."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,75,"Grim, relentless and immensely satisfying, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 sends out the dystopian sci-fi franchise on a feel-bad high. Readers of Suzanne Collins’ source novel, who already know what’s coming, will be pleased by the movie’s merciless fidelity to the source material (or perhaps, considering the book is the least popular in the trilogy, will just be annoyed all over again)."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,70,"Mockingjay Part 2 is a worthy conclusion to a series that’s meant so much to so many, made stars of its younger players and allowed more-established performers to shamelessly ham it up."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,70,"Katniss has remained, in Jennifer Lawrence’s portrayal, a vividly vulnerable creature of flesh and blood surrounded by sci-fi extravagance of variable quality."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,70,"One could argue that “Mockingjay” didn’t really merit being split in two (and surely a single three-hour movie could be made of it), but we benefit from the fact that the film has been given room to breathe, which allows for subtle character moments...and the gradual building of suspense during the actual siege in the Capitol."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,68,"As far as structure, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 has pretty much the same flaws as its source material. Freed from the confines of the literal arena from the first two books/movies, the overarching sequence of events seems ragged by comparison."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"Director Francis Lawrence stages the action sequences, both aboveground and underground, with a modicum of flair, and Julianne Moore as rebel leader Coin gives off some sparks – she’s a reformer with a totalitarian streak – but for the most part there is nothing divertingly new or different about this franchise fade-out."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"This concluding chapter is a solid culmination of a franchise that has had its ups and downs. Lawrence’s superb performance grounds the film, as she oscillates between badass archer and increasingly disenfranchised political pawn, and mercifully the late Hoffman’s CGI scenes are kept to a minimum."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"Awash in a depressive shade of perpetual blue, Mockingjay—Part 2 out-Nolans Christopher Nolan in the race to see just how dark a PG-13 tentpole can get before the audience itself revolts."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,67,"With its political power struggles and prodigious body count, all rendered in a thousand shades of wintry greige, the movie feels less like teen entertainment than a sort of Hunger Games of Thrones."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"It is almost criminal, though, that the end of this otherwise game-changing franchise full of bloodthirsty and complex women concludes on a painfully trite note – the strides made by all four films are undercut by Part 2’s underwhelming and hokey epilogue."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"Mockingjay Part 1, released a year ago, was a disjointed, incomplete affair and, although Mockingjay Part 2 is more polished, the pace is uneven and there’s a sense that the series has hung around too long."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"If Mockingjay - Part 1 was walkier and talkier than its forerunners, Part 2 is pretty much all action - and lesser for it."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"Most of the pleasure of Mockingjay — Part 2 comes from watching Lawrence, not the story around her. Her aim is true, even if the narrative arc of the movie traces a long, wobbly path toward its eventual, and not exactly happy, resting place."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,"It has the best action sequences of all four chapters, though its revolutionary message gets bogged down by a meandering plot and some good old-fashioned overacting."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,63,The Hunger Games has completed its tasks well and met fan expectations.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,60,"The pace, which had been so tightly controlled in the first two films, is a curious mess, starting off painfully slowly, then rushing when it really matters."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,60,"This is a dish that has been prepared over a low heat for a long time, which makes for some pretty slow-going early on."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,58,"Lawrence is never less than commanding in her last outing as the fiery dystopian heroine, but the most heartening liberation proffered by Part 2 is its star’s escape from this one-note fantasy series."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 has the technical polish and competent acting of the four-film series, though less intensity. It contains no surprises and ends with an anticlimax I have heard is faithful to the book, though it doesn’t amount to much onscreen."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"That ""The Hunger Games"" movies lost momentum is hardly a surprise: even ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" slipped after the second installment. The end feels like a relief for all concerned, and it does feel like the end."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The third and weakest book in Suzanne Collins’ trilogy should never have been split into two films, but since that’s become money-grubbing standard
practice for young-adult adaptations (“Twilight,” “Divergent”), here we are."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The result is a reminder that, with weak material, it’s often worse to have a really good actor. The weaknesses just stands out in sharper relief."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"It’s also true that toward the end of a big series the story eats the stars, and everybody in this movie, even Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, the Artemis-style revolutionary icon, is pretty much part of the furniture."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,The stakes are higher because this is the end—It really is this time!—but the first hour or so of returning director Francis Lawrence’s film is legitimately nap-inducing.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,50,"The aesthetically misguided idea of breaking the final book into two films, commercially remunerative though it might have been, has ended up making the dragged-out proceedings feel anti-climactic and emotionally static."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,40,"Give Lawrence credit for a seriously emotional performance, at least, and thanks to supporting actors Moore, Sutherland and a sly Woody Harrelson for adding color and comedy."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,38,It careens from carnage to group therapy so wildly that the action never gets to build and the conversations just repeat themselves.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,281723902,38,"Mockingjay II is a bare bones finale — a tedious two hours in which nothing at all happens, with the briefest of breaks for a zombie chase and attack and a half-hearted bit of sci-fi combat."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,90,"It is one continuous fight sequence from opening scene to final credits, but lacks the blood, profanity, and gore that would have merited a more adult rating."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,75,"The movie's extensive martial arts sequences, in which combatants bounce off each other doing triple handsprings, suggest a slightly more earthbound version of the aerial ballets in Hong Kong action-adventure films."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,70,"But where others have sunk in the mire of imitation, director Paul Anderson and writer Kevin Droney effect a viable balance between exquisitely choreographed action and ironic visual and verbal counterpoint."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,70,"Expect lots of earsplitting music, garish visuals and badly staged martial arts action."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,63,"A mix of martial-arts and special-effects magic, the film serves its nonstop confrontations either straight up or with a twist (as when they involve Kombatants with special powers, like Sub-Zero, Reptile and Scorpion)."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,60,"The filmmakers try to solve the problem of turning an experience which merely consists of a series of fights into a story by... ignoring it, presenting a film which merely consists of a series of fights."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,60,"And although director Paul Anderson treats the story with appropriate deadpan respect, there are enough sparks of humor (particularly generated by Linden Ashby as a shallow martial-arts actor who worries that he's a fake, with good reason) to amuse the adults accompanying the 10-year-old boys in the audience."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,58,"It is, in essence, the video game transferred part and parcel to the screen, and very well at that."
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,50,"Mortal Kombat the movie has everything a teenage boy could want: snakes that jut out of a villain's palms, acrobatic kung- fu fighting and a couple of battling babes. Everything, that is, but an interesting plot, decent dialogue and compelling acting"
Mortal Kombat,5.8,70454098,50,But soon the movie falls flat under an uninspired good-versus-evil plot and pathetically simpleminded dialogue.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,88,"Damon’s everyman workhorse is tragically sympathetic, plodding ahead against all odds. Copley is brilliant as the sadistic villain.  Foster is … well, you gotta see it to believe it.  In the meantime, you’ll be treated to one of the most entertaining action films of the year."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,83,I wish that the film had more of the tasty futuristic detail promised by that dummy parole officer. I also wish that Blomkamp took us deeper into the world of Elysium.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,83,"With Elysium, Blomkamp has made good on the promise of ""District 9"" and proven that working on a bigger canvas doesn't mean compromising on smarts or aspirations to deliver tentpole sized stories with a thoughtful backbone."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"In lesser hands, Elysium might have played like a Lib Dem manifesto with extra spaceships, but the South African filmmaker wants to explore ideas, not wave placards, and whether or not you agree with the film’s politics, the fire in its belly is catching."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"Not perfect, but a much more satisfying Earth-in-ruins film than Oblivion or After Earth. It is a little more conventional than District 9 (what isn’t?), but confirms Blomkamp as one of the potential science-fiction greats of this decade."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"At last, a good big film. The legacy of the summer, thus far, has been jetsam: moribund movies that lie there, bloated and beached, gasping to break even. But here is something angry and alive: Elysium."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,80,"Even working within a more conventional framework, Blomkamp again proves to be a superb storyteller. He has a master’s sense of pacing, slowly immersing us into his future world rather than assailing us with nonstop action, and envisioning that world with an architect’s eye for the smallest details."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"In a summer of antiseptic effects spectacles, Elysium stands out for its grime and intensity, as well as the bluntness of its class allegory."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-handbasket spectacles, Elysium takes the cake."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Elysium proves better at social polemics than escapism, a balancing act Blomkamp managed well in District 9, with its allegory of South Africa's apartheid era."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,Decidedly more thought-provoking than most big-studio summer fare.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"This vision of a violent future makes Elysium well worth seeing, even as the conventional violence of the thriller finale makes it a missed opportunity."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Blomkamp's universe is a fascinating place to visit and the movie is stuffed with ideas - there's far too much here to satisfactorily explore in 109 minutes, especially when one considers that room must be made for action scenes. I departed the theater satisfied with what I'd seen but wanting more."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"With most films, that'd be enough to cut out half the potential American audience. But effective, evocative science fiction, which Elysium is, has a way of getting by with an ILA (Insidious Liberal Agenda) in the guise of worst-case dystopia."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Like District 9, an allegory of apartheid that took four Oscar nods and put Blomkamp on the map, Elysium delivers sci-fi without dumbing it down. It's a hell-raiser with a social conscience."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Elysium, the second movie from writer-director Neill Blomkamp, isn’t quite as inventive or fresh as his knockout debut, 2009’s ""District 9."" But the new picture is cut from the same cloth — furiously exciting sci-fi, carefully considered and loaded with allegories and social commentary."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"Appreciate Elysium for what it is, sci-fi that’s smarter, more topical and more invigorating than most of what passes through that genre these days, and another sign that its director is the most promising chap to enter the field since the inception of Christopher Nolan."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"If Elysium is the brainiest Hollywood movie of the summer, it's also the most conflicted one."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,75,"If Elysium isn’t the post-millennial sci-fi masterpiece I was hoping for, it has tremendous resonance and is pretty doggone good for its category."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,70,"Mr. Damon brings both a weary optimism and convincing physicality to Max, who is no revolutionary. He just wants to live, and is willing to don an exoskeletal combat suit and fight robots to do it."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,70,Mr. Damon’s performance helps keep the movie from sinking under the weight of its artfully constructed horrors.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,70,"What made “District 9” special was attention to details: You believed in the characters, their society and their surroundings. The big effects in Elysium work fine. But the people never become individuals, and the vagueness and coincidental nature of the storytelling undermine its structure."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,67,"A high-low tension runs through Elysium, not only in the narrative itself, but in Blomkamp’s own cinematic language, which can be lofty one moment and gleefully pulpy the next."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,63,"It’s a letdown, but this director’s still a talent to be reckoned with."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,63,"A cheekily gruesome and genuinely urgent entertainment, Blomkamp's latest nevertheless can't help but beg the question: Where's Snake Plissken when you need him?"
Elysium,6.6,93050117,63,"Nothing in the movie matches the fascination of its premise and its opening 10 minutes: the undisturbed status quo is mesmeric. Once the narrative grinds into gear, however, the film's distinctive quality is lost."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Although the pulp energy that Blomkamp brings to this material makes it consistently watchable, the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"This is a messy, poorly structured film, riddled with plot holes and lacking any kind of satisfying conclusion."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"For all its simple politics, clanging dialogue, and underwritten roles—only Damon’s natural, and deepening, ability to suggest unspoken disappointment gives his character dimension—Elysium works, though never as well as it should."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Unfortunately, Elysium devolves. It doesn’t address the ramifications of making everyone healthy for eternity, or what it is on Earth they’re making or digging up that fuels whatever economy is left on the space station. For such a well thought-out premise, there’s not a mention of how capitalism works in this futureworld."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"This perfectly alright actioner will entertain newcomers, while leaving Blomkamp fans in a holding pattern until his next project."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Hollywood loves these apocalypse-soon stories, however, because they function as blank canvases for ruin porn, and if nothing else, Neill Blomkamp’s Elysium gives us the realistically trashed tomorrow we suspect we deserve."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Granted, Elysium could be more clever as it goes about its business. This is smart sci-fi, but it's not as smart as it could have been -- or as many ""District 9"" fans were probably hoping it would be."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,60,"Frankly, Elysium is a bit of a liberal’s wet dream: the good guys want accessible healthcare, while the bad guys want to do away with undocumented immigrants."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,59,"Blomkamp overdoes even his best effects. (I would have welcomed more vistas of Elysium to break up the grungefest.) If Elysium is an example of how recession-era Hollywood intends to dramatize the rift between the haves and the have-nots, let’s hope the studios don’t also bring back Smell-O-Rama."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,58,"With Elysium, the director proves that he still has one hand on the X-Box controller; maybe he should give the allegories a rest already and just get back in the game."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,58,"The action is bludgeoning. When Max gets pummeled by fists and lethal objects, we get pummeled by light and noise and rock-'em-sock-'em editing. No shrimp, though. As a narrative, ""District 9"" wasn't particularly original, either — in the end it was a standard conversion melodrama. But everything is better with shrimp."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,50,"Kudos to Blomkamp for not shying away from social issues in his films, but here the execution doesn’t live to the intentions."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,50,"While the movie may not, in the end, be so effective in tapping into our current class anxieties, that hardly seems to matter. Like a trip to Elysium, it’s a wild ride."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,50,"Ultimately, Elysium ends up with explosions, running gun battles, and summer non-blockbuster tedium. The outcome is never in question, and while Blomkamp has proven himself to be a master of sci-fi social commentary in the past, this dull wheel in the sky just lands with a resounding thud."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,40,"Damon is as buff as ever, maybe even more so... But watching him lumber through Elysium's bramble of lofty ideals is no damn fun."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,40,"All the interest and good will built up by the sharply conceived preliminaries is washed away in a succession of scenes that feel crushingly routine and generic, not to mentioned guided by ideological urges."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,40,One of Blomkamp’s most unlikely conceits is a machine – apparently standard-issue in all of Elysium’s made-to-order McMansions – that can heal all injuries and infections at the flick of a switch. He could have used one to fix Elysium’s battered and broken screenplay.
Elysium,6.6,93050117,38,"For a 99 percenter movie, then, Elysium is kind of a head-scratcher. It throws away its best opportunity for drama. It’s as if Han and Leia parked on the Death Star and started asking, “How much is a two-bedroom around here?”"
Elysium,6.6,93050117,38,"Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns, or staging high-tech fistfights between Elysium’s stolid hero and his even duller arch-nemesis. It’s a waste of a perfectly good dystopia."
Elysium,6.6,93050117,30,The result is a grim and predictable adventure saga that is not nimble but leaden. Dystopia has rarely been so dysto-pointing.
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,90,"The chase scenes in The Italian Job are the most exciting ones I can remember seeing in a movie in a long time, probably because they're the only ones I can remember -- and that's saying something."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,90,"A fast and furious action-adventure. The film's comedy counts for as much as the clever and risky ways in which Wahlberg and company go after the nasty Norton, who has holed up in a Bel-Air mansion with a world-class security system."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,90,"Less giddy and more cohesive than the original, the film doesn't waste time, plunging almost directly into a spectacular heist."

The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,80,"It's more like the déjà vu machine. But that does not negate this movie's copious pleasures, chief among them its prudent decision to act like it's never supposed to be more than good time, a thrilling test-drive in a car you love but can't afford to actually buy."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,80,"It is, as with any cinematic joy ride, not the destination that matters, but the rush of getting there."

The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,75,"Norton is unapologetic and unflappable in his part. Slimy and vaguely nerdy, he's become the thinking man's thug, even if this character's Armani-wear is better tailored than his psychology."

The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,75,"It's an entertaining picture, classy and well executed, but as much as any film I've seen recently, this lush new version of the 1969 Michael Caine thriller tends to prove that, where thrillers are concerned, ""more"" is often less."

The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,70,"Satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting. In terms of action, moreover, this makes ""The Matrix Reloaded"" look like a clodhopper's jamboree."

The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,67,"Essentially an old-fashioned movie, nothing fancy, nothing new, just some jokes and some action and a crowd-pleasing finale."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,67,"A slicker, faster-paced, high-tech upgrade that lifts the sprightly spirit and the main action set piece from the original while developing its own twists and a new ending that, though a bit too pat and eager to please, is a vast improvement."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,63,"Heist movies seem pretty quaint and analog in our era where high stakes crime is primarily electronic in nature. But until someone can make embezzlement cinematically interesting, were left with theft and this movie just gets away with it."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,63,"Even if it weren't a remake, The Italian Job would still look startlingly unoriginal, but in a summer that promises plenty of sold-out showings, it could be the season's breakout pretty-okay-second-choice film."

The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,50,"Watching The Italian Job in a theater makes you long for a fast-forward button - to skip past 90 eyeball-glazing minutes of generic caper plotting and cut to the chase, as it were."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,50,"Do yourself a favor and resist The Italian Job, a lazy and in-name-only remake of 1969's G-rated Michael Caine heist pic."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,50,"After concocting one tense crime at the beginning, the writers can't do any better than to imitate it later."
The Italian Job,7.0,106128601,50,"A triumph for the machines, more proof that we do indeed live in the Matrix."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,Del Toro moves his story along with unrelenting energy and wit while introducing the opposing parties with admirable efficiency.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,"Surprisingly smart, graphically faithful live-action adaptation of the Mike Mignola series"
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,"One of the most poetic comic-book adaptations to come along in years, yet it never loses its sense of lightness and fun -- del Toro gives it just enough screwball nuttiness to keep it from bogging down."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,Guillermo del Toro is in a class with Peter Jackson as a fan-boy who gets it--a brilliant filmmaker who has a kind of metabolic connection to horror and sci-fi that helps him transform secondhand genre material into something deep and nourishing. Del Toro reaches into himself and finds the Wagnerian grandeur in schlock.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,Hellboy just might end up being one of the best movies you see this year.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,90,"One of those rare movies that's not only based on a comic book, but also feels like a comic book. It's vibrating with energy, and you can sense the zeal and joy in its making."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,88,The movie's got a heart as warm as hellfire.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,83,"One of the sturdier superhero movies of the last couple of years, with monsters and effects and diabolical baddies to spare, a heart as big as a house and a love story that actually gets its hooks in you."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,80,"Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,80,"Played by Ron Perlman, he's the most magnetic action hero I've come across in a long while."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,80,Directed by Guillermo del Toro with a colorfully kinetic visual imagination that seldom lets up.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"Hellboy likely won't be the best comic-to-screen adaptation this year, but, squared off against its early-season challenger, Marvel's ""The Punisher,"" this is the winner."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"The film - despite being a half-hour too long - is a rocking, rolling supernatural spectacle."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"The screenplay has flashes of real wit, and Perlman is perfect in the title role."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"Hellboy may be a big, noisy goof of a comic-book action film, but love is in the dank, dark, subterranean air as the bulky red-hued palooka tries to win the heart of the pyrokinetic beauty Liz Sherman."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,Hellboy is on fire with scares and laughs and del Toro’s visionary dazzle. It’s the tenderness that comes as an unexpected bonus.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,The movie has a self- deprecating sense of humor and a strong emotional core that vaults it above most action movies that come out this time of year.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"There are other filmmakers who might have been drawn to a comic book as enchantingly ridiculous as Hellboy.  But there are none who would have turned in a sleek $60 million picture as daringly silly, playful and imaginative as this one."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"So forget about taking anyone under 12. But if you want to see what a benign demon looks like when he's eating nachos and unwinding to Al Green, this is the movie for you."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"Hellboy is, to borrow a phrase, one helluva good time."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,"If the film's love triangle feels a little silly and the arch-villains a little over the top, it's all secondary to del Toro's passionate immersion in Hellboy."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,75,Has more than enough across-the-board appeal to attract mainstream auds unfamiliar with source material.
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"An enjoyable if somewhat neutered defender of the free world. Make no mistake: Hellboy still has a hide as hard-boiled as Lee Marvin in ""The Dirty Dozen,"" but now he's also wearing a smile."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"Pretty much impossible not to like a little, but it's also hard to like a lot. There's a fantastic film to be made from this material, but now, the burden of making it falls to a sequel."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"To his credit, del Toro does not flinch from the ridiculous. But he is equally sensitive to Hellboy's pulp poetry."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,70,"While the film ably thrusts longtime fans of Mignola’s highly stylized artwork and newcomers alike into the world of that ol' debbil Hellboy, the film suffers from both scattershot character development and a serious case of H.P. Lovecraft overdose."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,67,"Will dazzle you while establishing the world in which it takes place. After that, you may wonder whether Guillermo del Toro got amnesia halfway through."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,63,"Surprisingly enjoyable, as adaptations of cult comic books go, thanks to a sense of humor all too rare in the genre, winning performances by Ron Perlman and Selma Blair, and a sweet romance of the kind that made ""Spider-Man"" a richer experience than its competitors."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,63,"It's a treat because, making no apologies for the source material, director Guillermo del Toro lets his picture gorge on power bars of pop energy, sugared with sprinkles of playful humour, and, at least twice, laced with a visual style so piercingly keen that horror morphs into beauty. Not bad for a pulpy outing."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,63,"Hellboy might not have the name-recognition factor of the Spider- or Batmen, but Guillermo del Toro brings the audience swiftly up to speed on artist-writer Mike Mignola's comic book anti-hero."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,60,"For all its f/x pageantry, it is rather tired, as if it's the third sequel of a franchise, not the initial episode."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,58,"Standard-issue superhero movie -- except that writer-director Guillermo del Toro, taking his cue from ""Hellboy"" comic book creator Mike Mignola, brings a wicked sense of humor to this particular monster mash."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Hellboy's adventures may take him to you-know-where and back, but the movie remains in limbo."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Arguing that you shouldn't expect rich characterization from a comic-book movie misses the point: Vivid relationships separate the graphic novels from the funnies and, in the end, spectacular set design is just window dressing."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Hellboy's cheeky attitude and snarky dialogue, specifically Perlman's snidely funny lines, are the highlights."
Hellboy,6.9,59623958,50,"Hellboy is as much a wreck as ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" or ""The Punisher,"" coming and going in two weeks, and as much a bore as ""The Hulk."""
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,100,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire more than makes the case for this as a franchise that's going to get better as it goes, and I am genuinely excited to see how they wrap it up."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,91,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is movie escapism made with intelligence, and that doesn't come around often enough. As I sensed this movie ending I wished it wouldn't, and when it did I wanted the next one now. Take that, Bilbo."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,91,"Catching Fire is a monumental achievement, a massively entertaining crowd-pleaser that is thought-provoking and personally inspiring in all of the ways that it aspires to be."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,90,"Catching Fire is exceptional entertainment, a spectacle with a good mind and a pounding heart."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,90,"[Francis] Lawrence and his team have calibrated the entire experience for maximum engagement. And while its pleasures can’t touch the thrill of seeing the Death Star destroyed — not yet, at least — the film runs circles around George Lucas’ ability to weave complex political ideas into the very fabric of B-movie excitement."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"The result is not only a dramatic improvement over what was already an unusually smart and satisfying pop-cultural parable of insurgent 99-per-cent rebellion, but a very likely candidate for the all-time-great-sequel sweepstakes."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"Very few people will take in this spectacle of a society amusing itself to death, of “reality games” and the vapid media hysteria that surrounds them, and not draw a parallel to our own televised bread and circuses. At its best, “Catching Fire” is a blockbuster that bites the culture that made it."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,Pop-culture escapism can be thrilling when dished out by experts. Katniss is a character worth a handful of sequels. And Lawrence lights up the screen. You'll follow her anywhere.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,"The screen translation of Catching Fire, the second volume of the series, offers its audience many of the elements that made The Hunger Games compelling, but adds to that by deepening the themes and emotional currents and traveling to darker destinations."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,88,Catching Fire makes only the occasional misstep.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,83,"As teencentric franchises go, I much prefer The Hunger Games to the blessedly expired “Twilight” films. For one thing, they employ much better actors. My favorite: Amanda Plummer, one of the best and most underused actresses in America, as one of the Quell contestants."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,83,Lawrence steps up. And her character's fierce independence provides a welcome alternative to certain vampire-fixated young-adult heroines who define themselves entirely through the attention of much-much-older men.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"With Catching Fire, director Lawrence certainly isn't afraid to bide his time and build anticipation for the truly spectacular (and tropical-tinged) Quarter Quell, patiently reestablishing crucial relationships for maximum dramatic pay-off."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s a middle chapter, for sure, but a vigorous and fast-paced one that leaves you hungry for more."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Spinning in that wedding dress, or glaring in wary repose, Lawrence catches fire on screen."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,An effective piece of melodramatic popular entertainment that savvily builds on the foundation established by the first Hunger Games movie.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Catching Fire is a great leap forward for the franchise. Seeing as it’s all about hope and what it represents, here’s hoping the next two are just as good, if not better."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"The good news is it comes very close, and does it without sacrificing its soul. Despite its sense of been-here-slayed-that, director Francis Lawrence expertly delivers thrills, ideas and spectacle."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s not just bigger, it’s better, and it bodes well for the future of the series, if not necessarily of its unlucky protagonist."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Relatively speaking, Catching Fire is terrific. Even nonrelatively, it's pretty damn good."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Defying rote heroics and sidestepping those solemn Frodoisms lurking in the role, Lawrence seeks out the complex, human and earthy in Katniss, still the beating heart and total triumph of these movies."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"It’s a critic’s instinct to auto-praise any blockbuster that tries to do something different, but Catching Fire is so committed to carrying on the fine work started by its predecessor that the applause flows utterly naturally."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,Catching Fire looks and feels epic. Hands down it’s one of the most entertaining films of the year.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,80,"Catching Fire delivers on all the promise of Part 1 with a gutsier, tougher, better round of Games."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,79,"Everything that felt clumsy in The Hunger Games has been improved upon here. That's most apparent in the clarity of the action, but it also extends to how efficiently the film establishes so many new ensemble members."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,79,Steady-handed action is enough to elevate this film above its predecessor.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter. She is but one female, but she's the perfect antidote to the surplus of male superheroes out there."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Best in its first hour, when it concentrates on the politics and the specific horrors of Panem. It becomes more conventional in the second half and loses steam, but it's always heading somewhere."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,Catching Fire is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire is a work of thoughtful, emotionally engaging sci-fi — everything that its predecessor The Hunger Games was not."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire has the bonus of a genuinely charismatic performer at its center. Jennifer Lawrence, now an Oscar winner thanks to ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" emotes like crazy throughout ""Catching Fire,"" but you never catch her acting."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Like too many franchise installments, Catching Fire builds to more of an ellipsis than a period, teasing the next chapter instead of providing closure. But isn’t that true of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as well? At least casual fans will only have to wait a year, not three, to see what happens next in this galaxy not so far away."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Catching Fire is bigger, better and broodier than the first film."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Yes, it’s the middle chapter and feels like it, but it’s never dull."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,75,"Francis Lawrence imbues the source material with visceral pleasure in well-wrought scenes vacillating between elaborate spectacle, breathtaking terror, and--occasionally--surprising beauty."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Insofar as Catching Fire does ignite, the match to the flame is Jennifer Lawrence, who gives Katniss layers she lacks even in the books’ fairly rich characterization."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Catching Fire isn’t a great work of art but it’s a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"Catching Fire suffers from the movie equivalent of middle-book syndrome: The story is wayward and rangy, on its way to being something, maybe, but not adding up to much by itself. Still, it’s entertaining as civics lessons go, and it’s a more polished, assured picture than its predecessor."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,70,"This is a safe, serviceable, carefully crafted action drama in which the subversive seeds planted in the first story take welcome root."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,67,"Lawrence gives the same committed, heart-rending performance, and she’s even more saintly than before: The script never lets her fire an arrow except in self-defense, and she stubbornly defies Snow in public, though she knows the probable consequence is death. Hutcherson has more personality this time, yet Peeta doesn’t deepen as a character."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,67,"The Hunger Games franchise, both in print and onscreen, has been exceptionally clever about cozying away imaginative space for fans to fill in the blanks and cast themselves in the rich drama. That this latest film leaves us hungering for more only means that it’s working."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,Everyone hits their marks with gusto and believability in Catching Fire... But the engine of the entire operation is Jennifer Lawrence.
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,"The ingredients are in place for a potent finale, but “Catching Fire” is watered down."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,63,"Crowd-pleasing and compelling, most of all because of its fiery, charismatic heroine."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,60,"A Matrix Reloaded–like cliffhanger reminds that this is only the second installment out of four (good lord), but at least the flick leaves us with more than a tinge of interest in whom the odds will favor next."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,60,"What lets the movie down is its heart, or lack thereof. The reprise of the Games introduces new adversaries (and some allies) but has exactly the same dynamic as in the first movie."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Yet, despite the good acting, the middle section of the film, set at the Capitol, is attenuated and rhythmless — the filmmakers seem to be touching all the bases so that the trilogy’s readers won’t miss anything."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Enough is enough. One good thing: The jungle scenes were shot in Hawaii, so at least they all got a paid vacation."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,424668047,50,"Deep thoughts about re-directing cynically manipulated celebrity, lump in the throat moments at people rising up against their oppressors, a couple of memorable deaths and attempts at sacrifice play as flat when there’s nothing around them to serve as contrast."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,90,Logan's Run is a rewarding futuristic film that appeals both as spectacular-looking escapist adventure as well as intelligent drama.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,75,"Logan's Run is a vast, silly extravaganza that delivers a certain amount of fun, once it stops taking itself seriously."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,70,"Logan's Run is less interested in logic than in gadgets and spectacle, but these are sometimes jazzily effective and even poetic. Had more attention been paid to the screenplay, the movie might have been a stunner."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,70,"Taken for what it is, Logan's Run delivers a fun ride and a glimpse at another era, even if it's probably not the time frame the producers had in mind."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,60,A sci-fi which balances big themes and claustrophobic action with apparent ease.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,50,Hit-and-miss.
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,50,"The lavish production has some good effects sequences, but its plot is as corny as the dreadful lurex drape costumes and Jerry Goldsmith's slushy score. Fundamentally, this is just further proof of Hollywood's untiring ability to reduce all science fiction to its most feeble stereotypes."
Logan's Run,6.8,25000000,40,"A numbing combination of sloppy writing, vulgar art direction, high school acting, and bungled special effects—in short, par for the course for venerable hack Michael Anderson."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,100,"The mix of dark humor, creeping suspense, and a sort of apocalyptic tenderness makes this the best horror flick in years."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,100,A great piece of filmmaking and a legitimate science-fiction/horror classic.
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,100,"Joon-Ho's epic is a masterpiece of monster cinema that's intelligent, innovative, and reaches down to the basic core of family unity to propel its story beyond mere conventions of science fiction."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,100,The Host isn't just a terrific monster movie. This South Korean box-office smash is also a laugh-out-loud comedy and a surprisingly angry political satire.
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,100,I have seen The Host twice and have every intention of watching it again.
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,91,"Bong Joon-ho's wildly entertaining saga should become the hip, thinking-person's monster movie of choice."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,91,"A cross between ""Godzilla"" and ""Jaws,"" it manages to be both truly scary and truly funny – sometimes all at once."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,91,"The sudden turns of temperament are a treat after the smart-ass attitude of American horror flicks, and the film is full of minor surprises, squirming in unexpected directions without leaving the conventions behind."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,90,"With a subversive streak as wide as the Han and a title open to interpretation, The Host confounds our expectations while providing top-notch entertainment. For Bong, the monster movie is an ample vessel, one that he can fill with social criticism while discovering exuberant amusement in the process."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,90,"The Host is a cautionary environmental tale about the domination of nature and the costs of human folly, and it may send chills up your spine. But only one will tickle your fancy and make you cry encore, not just uncle."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,90,"If this madly entertaining movie has a fault, it's that it's too ingenious for the genre it ostensibly inhabits."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,90,"The movie pops up out of nowhere, grabs you in its big, messy tentacles, and drags you down into murky depths, where social satire coexists with slapstick, and B-movie clichés mutate into complex metaphors."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,89,"The Host is a freewheeling mix of high style and goofy, good-natured fear-mongering."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"When the movie isn't being scary, it's crazily funny, so much so that critical watchers will wonder if Bong might tilt the balance of the picture too far in a comic direction and water down the scares. He doesn't."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"The tone of The Host is slippery in the best way; you're never sure if you're in for a joke or a shock, yet nothing feels random."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,This Korean-made film takes the well-worn creature-feature genre and spins it on its head thrillingly.
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,A fantastical genre-buster.
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"Boon's film is both funny and heartbreaking, a supremely confident mix of political satire, free-floating paranoia, fractured family dynamics and the kind of comedy that regularly reconfigures itself into tragedy."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"Mostly, though, it's ""Godzilla"" with a severe case of Murphy's Law, and it is never less than bizarrely delightful."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"Is it that scary? Yes. Will it reduce you to quivering jelly? Oh, my, yes! Does it bust the bonds of the Godzilla formula to fuse fright with feeling? Better believe it, dudes."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"A wonderful, witty mix of horror and social satire, The Host takes its simple, time-tested premise - menacing creature terrorizes the populace - and runs with it."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,88,"The first 20 minutes of the South Korean film The Host represents one of the most entertaining movie openings in memory. It's the same kind of pop-culture thrill provided by Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws,"" with the same sense of astonishment, fear and pleasure at something genuinely new."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,83,"Most of all, The Host functions as a popcorn movie par excellence, loaded with the most familiar conventions, but shot through with such conviction and visual panache that even its clichés seem invigorating."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,80,"On almost every level, there's never quite been a monster movie like The Host. Egregiously subverting its own genre while still delivering shocks at a pure genre level, and marbled with straight-faced character humor that constantly throws the viewer off balance."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,80,"The Host packs a lot into its two tumultuous hours: lyrically disgusting special effects, hair-raising chases, outlandish political satire, and best of all, a dysfunctional-family psychodrama--an odyssey that's like a grisly reworking of ""Little Miss Sunshine."""
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,80,"The Host is a miracle of breathless play with form and tone that also seethes with attitude and ideas, from pure movie love to pointed sociopolitical commentary to a bleak existentialism about the inherent cruelty of our world."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,80,"A thrilling ride and a sometimes dry, sometimes sweet comedy, but beneath all that is a humane and tragic view of life worthy of the greatest films. Even those without rubber monsters."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,75,"Bong's primary point is dead-on: Battling bureaucracy, from dishonest government leaders to indifferent civil servants, is the biggest horror of all."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,75,"I never thought I'd crack up watching a family mourn the death of a beloved daughter. But I've never seen a film quite like The Host, and that's far from the most bizarre thing in it."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,75,"Although it strikes a perfect balance between otherworldly, slimy menace and 1950s B-movie cheesiness, The Host's computer-generated mutant isn't what makes this frantic, wild picture so much fun."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,70,"Bong has pulled together a multilayered horror-drama that works more often than not. The film gets back on track after a clumsy middle section that's too long and finishes strong, and Bong fans, horror fans and Asiaphiles are likely to be thoroughly satisfied."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,70,"Gross-out horror is never far from comedy and The Host, Bong Joon-ho's giddy creature feature, has an anarchic mess factor worthy of a pile of old ""Mad"" magazines."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,70,It's the last thing anyone expected: an old-fashioned monster movie with a heart.
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,63,"The Host is a strange little movie: part creature feature, part social commentary, and part slapstick comedy. The problem with the film is that the sum isn't greater than the parts and the pieces don't fuse in a way that's consistently pleasing or cinematically satisfying."
Gwoemul,7.0,2201923,58,"In ""Jaws,"" you didn't know whether to laugh or to scream. In The Host, the yocks rarely mesh with the yucks."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,90,"A classic adventure story that brilliantly transcends its fairly average formula (buttoned-up city gal is softened by devil-may-care chancer while outwitting baddies in foreign lands) through a mixture of perfect casting, lashings of chemistry between the stars and a clever script."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,88,Douglas and Turner make a great double act in this exuberantly directed adventure movie with a great start turn from the always enjoyable De Vito. Good stuff.
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,80,"The filmmakers have devised some clever twists on the earlier films they recall - Raiders of the Lost Ark and Peter Pan among them - and they reserve a good share of the derring-do for their heroine, who's a refreshingly far cry from the helpless ladies-in-distress of old. Under the direction of Robert Zemeckis, the action goes limp and perfunctory at a few key moments, weakening the picture's wallop. But it still packs a healthy amount of self-deflating fun."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,75,"Although comparisons with Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark are inevitable, it is the interplay between Turner and Douglas that gives the film its real charm. Norman and DeVito score strongly in roles that would have been played by Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre 30 years ago, and the whole film has the feel of an old Warner Bros. thriller with broadly comic overtones."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,75,"A silly, high-spirited chase picture that takes us, as they say, from the canyons of Manhattan to the steaming jungles of South America. After all the Raiders rip-offs, it's fun to find an adventure film that deserves the comparison, that has the same spirit and sense of humor."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,75,"Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are wonderful together. They look great when they're in bed together and they look even better when they're fighting. Throw Danny DeVito into the mix and you've got a very enjoyable, watchable trio of heroes."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,70,"The script is sharp and funny, the direction sure-footed on both the comedy and action fronts, and the whole thing adds up to rather more concerted fun than Indiana Jones' flab-ridden escapade in the Temple of Doom."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,70,"After a fairly promising getaway, Romancing the Stone gradually chases its tail into enough melodramatic dead ends to deteriorate into an expendable runaround, all too easy to shrug off as a miscalculated clone of Raiders of the Lost Ark."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,60,"An elaborately produced, mostly charmless adventure-comedy that intends to make fun of a kind of romantic fiction that's one step removed from what the movie is all about."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,60,"Directed by an unimaginative Robert Zemeckis three years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, it uses Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones franchise as the template through which to bolster Douglas’s public machismo."
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,50,Director Robert Zemeckis displays such dazzling cinematic know-how that it's genuinely depressing when this film falls off into the usual self-ridicule.
Romancing the Stone,6.9,76572238,50,"Heading for the jungles in her high heels, Turner is like a lot of unwitting screen heroines ahead of her, guaranteed that her drab existence is about to be transformed – probably by a man, preferably handsome and adventurous. Sure enough, Michael Douglas pops out of the jungle. The expected complications are supplied by the kidnappers, Danny DeVito and Zack Norman."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,90,"Puerile, pitiful, grotesque, offensive, immature, repulsive and, of course, extremely funny."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,90,Mike Myers unleashes (or seems to unleash) the entire contents of his comic mind.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,90,"Mike Myers is like a rich 12-year-old who rents out F.A.O. Schwartz, upends every toy in under two hours, and brings in strippers. He can get away with this privileged romp because he grooves on what he does in a way that none of his contemporaries -- can comprehend."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,88,"The funniest, crassest, wildest, most musical, most satirical and most scatological of the Powers trilogy. And you get to watch Britney Spears' head explode. What more could you want?"
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,83,You go into an Austin Powers movie with a big grin on -- or at least you should. The charm of this one is that you leave smiling even more broadly.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,80,"Like a giant balloon painted with Day-Glo colors, however, the whole gaudy mess wouldn't inflate without the force of Mr. Myers's comic genius. It's his baby, baby. And after three editions, it's still flying high."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,80,"It's a mess, and a ridiculous golden shower of toilet humor. But Mike Myers' superspy spoof still provides the summer's purest movie delight."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,The most consistently funny of the ''Austin Powers'' films.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,This summer's comic gem.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,"Mike Myers and Austin Powers may stick to their old Beatle boots, but they've both come a long way, luvvy. For proof, just look at all the A-list celebrities-I-won't-mention happy to crash the party."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,"Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,75,"The best way to look at this installment, however, is as musical theater of the absurd. The song-and-dance set pieces are brilliant, including a rap-style ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" in a prison."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"Caine is burlesquing his own iconography and enjoying every minute of it. He hasn't lost his dignity, though; it takes a lot of self-possession to act this blissfully silly. He even looks good with bad teeth."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"Not since the heyday of Fellini, I dare say, has there been such a merrygoround of a movie."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"The latest installment in the Austin Powers series has stopped making much sense at all, but it sure gets its giggle on, and good."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,70,"It's often quite funny (when it's not spinning its wheels in rehashed skits and recycled gags), but when Myers gets his mojo working and his mind out of the toilet, he's capable of better."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,67,"Austin does have a psychedelic buoyancy and Dr. Evil an addle-pated sadistic goofiness that are original and engaging, but Myers doesn't build on their best stuff. That's where a real plot would help."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,67,"It's a shapeless, derivative-but-funny show with another loony parody plot about super-villain Dr. Evil."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"In all fairness to the film, it is superior to the disappointing second movie in the series. The comedy is about as low-brow as it can get (at least without treading into R-rated territory)."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"Uneven, self-conscious but often hilarious spoof."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"With the jokes coming about one per second, you're bound to find something to laugh at. I found myself laughing a lot--even as I began to feel the whole thing wearing thin."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,63,"A picture that, even more than the previous two, feels like a bunch of gags tossed together. The laughs are here, to be sure, although even some of the best of them are retreads and the Swinging '60s recycling act is now feeling a bit past its zeitgeist prime."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,60,"The gifted Myers lets his once and (I hope) future shag king get lost in an elephantine Hollywood franchise. The first time was the charm, baby."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,60,"The laugh always comes first, and Myers' puppy-dog tenacity to that cast-iron tenet of low comedy, disarming and even somewhat charming in the first film, now has an air of careerist desperation about it."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"A step or two down from the first and second, but it has some very funny moments, and maybe that is all we hope for."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,Casting Caine as Austin's father is a stroke of pure genius.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"The only thing that won't make you laugh, unless you've got a 12-year-old's sense of humor, is the film's tireless parade of gross-out gags and scatological verbal jests. Myers gets a charge out of this material--it wouldn't be here if he didn't--but so much of it is so tedious it's difficult to believe an adult actually sat down and wrote it."
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"The uneven Goldmember seems to take a big step toward the extremely juvenile, with more scatological and fewer sex jokes"
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,Star/writer Mike Myers and director Jay Roach struggle visibly with exhausted possibilities and diminishing returns.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,50,"To paraphrase one of the few memorable lines in the movie, ""Even stink would say this stinks."""
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,40,Goldmember comes after years of escalating vulgarity have thrown the need for caution -- and cleverness -- out of fashion.
Austin Powers in Goldmember,6.2,213307889,38,"Myers returns as his menagerie of repulsive characters, but this time, his frantic mugging feels more like an insipid parlor trick than ever."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,100,"Made with a palpable sense of urgency, this tense, propulsive motion picture is a model of what mainstream entertainment can be like when everything goes right."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,100,"What could be a cash grab turns out to be the series' finest chapter, with the same piano-wire tension plus a narrative clarity lacking before."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,95,"This fourth entry after a nine-year break for Damon and Greengrass should represent, for those ready and able to separate popcorn mayhem from the grim realities of world headlines, a bruising and exhilarating ride."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Despite regurgitating elements from the founding trilogy, Jason Bourne represents the best the series has yet offered."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Through it all, Damon keeps us glued to the war going on inside Bourne's head. It's a brilliantly implosive performance; he owns the role and the movie. It's a tense, twisty mindbender anchored by something no computer can generate: soul."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Christopher Rouse, director Paul Greengrass has come up with a post-Snowden film that delivers nonstop thrills."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,88,"Jason Bourne is the best action thriller of the year so far, with a half-dozen terrific chase sequences and fight scenes."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,83,"Director Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips, United 93) has always had a taste for the topical and political, and his third Bourne outing augments the usual truth-and-justice talking points with a strenuously current nod to digital privacy issues via a Zuckerberg-like social-media mogul (Riz Ahmed). If anything, he underplays those assets, shorting deeper story development for exotic zip codes, bang-up fisticuffs, and adrenalized chase scenes."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,80,"Yes, Jason Bourne basically amounts to a trio of action set-pieces elegantly strung together. But who really cares when they’re this impressive?"
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,80,"This explosive reunion between Damon and director Paul Greengrass further reveals key secrets about Bourne’s origins, bringing its lethal protagonist as close as he’s ever likely to get to total recall."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,75,"Other welcome faces include Alicia Vikander as a CIA analyst who has a better bead on Bourne than her superiors; Julia Stiles, in a repeat appearance as the spy’s former contact; and Riz Ahmed as a Silicon Valley billionaire."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,75,"At its best Jason Bourne crackles with professionalism; at its worst, it's rehashing greatest hits (as in, ""assassinations"") from earlier films, with a lavish budget."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,70,Its smooth efficiency offers plenty of sturdy pleasures. What’s missing are the emotional underpinnings that made these movies not just top-flight action vehicles but also stirringly soulful.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,70,"Up until a narratively implausible and logistically ridiculous climactic motorcycle chase through Vegas that feels like a sop to the Fast & Furious crowd, Jason Bourne is an engrossing re-immersion in the violent and mysterious world of Matt Damon's shadowy secret op."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,67,"For all its problems, Bourne is still thrilling and an undoubtedly engrossing action film thanks to its taut construction."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"The tradecraft is there, the film craft is there, but the craftiness of a great concept is gone. Any way Bourne can go through Treadstone again?"
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"I love the series, but Jason Bourne is the worst of the five."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"It exists for no other reason than that people like Matt Damon, they like him as this character, and the producers know audiences are willing to see more of him."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,63,"The movie gets lost in its focus on flash and speed, and forgets about the man — and the fine, quiet actor — at its center."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Greengrass is as dexterous as ever, yet the result, though abounding in thrills, seems oddly stifled by self-consciousness and, dare one say, superfluous. Come on, guys. There are so many wrongs in the world. If Bourne could tear himself away from the mirror for a moment, could he not be persuaded to go and right them?"
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Should you see it? Sure. The absolutely absurd, over-the-top Vegas chase scene assures you’ll get your money’s worth in ridiculousness. (Not all of Greengrass’ set pieces are smart.) But in truth, you’ll be there because it’s a Bourne movie, and you’ll like it a little better than you should because it is."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Greengrass, a meticulous, thoughtful filmmaker (he also directed the second and third films in the series, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum), clearly believes in what he’s doing. But his earnestness is at odds with the movie’s desperate, frenetic desire to keep us engaged every minute."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"The tedium, I would argue, is not incidental but essential, because this is not really a spy thriller or even a foot-chase and fist-fight-driven action movie, but rather a somber meditation on the crisis of the Gen-X professional in the throes of middle age."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Leagues ahead of Legacy but the weakest of the Matt Damon movies, Bourne still has the power to thrill. But it seems his story has run out of steam."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"When the talking stops the film takes off, with a pair of bone-rattling chases set in Athens and Las Vegas that cause maximum damage to people, property and the audience’s eardrums. A bracing reminder of how fiercely efficient Greengrass can be, these scenes just about justify the existence of Jason Bourne. But, please, no more."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"The political commentary feels far more explicitly pointed and widely integral than in previous incarnations which adds a bold new dynamic where perhaps the same re-inventive verve is lacking in the film's formulaic story. Fortunately, Greengrass and Damon are so in command of this material it's rarely too much of a concern. Even when little of substance seems to be happening, the narrative feels propulsive."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,"Hunting Bourne is more than ever a business now, with a bottom line to worry about, a crowd to please, and presumably hasty deadlines to meet. It’s not that there’s no pause for thought in this still-good-fun episode. There’s just not enough thought in the pauses."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,60,The Snowden/social media plotline of this film does a bit to make Bourne more relevant. But the ingredients are basically the same.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"While Jason Bourne isn’t half-bad as an action movie, it is a nakedly hollow exercise in resuscitating brand loyalty."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"As an actor, Matt Damon has too much integrity to pretend he can multitask to that advanced degree and still be, you know, a fun person. So he turns his face into a mask of stoicism and gives the dullest performance of his career."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"When it’s over, even viewers more eager to forgive this failed creative reunion will wonder what it is that they just watched, and what purpose it serves other than financial. And why no one figured out a new, engaging way to tell a story that’s already been told."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"Jason Bourne belongs to Damon and Greengrass, whose admirable — and entirely appropriate — goal of playing it for kicks comes across, this time around, as an oddly joyless chore."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"Rather than push this character or story forward, the film cravenly hits the reset button, doing more of the same with much less passion and skill."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"This current film smartly adds material that keeps it up-to-date with the reality of today’s sophisticated electronic surveillance. The series may become a marker by which we come to gauge the future disappearance of all personal privacy. For the sake of the series’ endurance, I hope so, but for the sake of the rest of us, I hope not."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,The movie is a by-the-numbers action film that's not nearly as strong as its Damon-led predecessors.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"There are scenes I dug and a few set-pieces that work, and there’s an overall level of intensity that I like from director Paul Greengrass. Taken as a whole, though, this is very familiar territory, and I just don’t care when the stakes are this low and the violence is this rough."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"There’s just not a lot of weight to this sequel, at least not enough to dissuade anyone from seeing this as anything but a limpid cash grab."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,The visceral visuals make this a barely-serviceable/watchable summer popcorn picture. But the bar was set high too long ago for that to be enough for America’s Bond.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,"While a reunion between Greengrass and Damon should feel like a refreshing extension of the franchise, Jason Bourne is just another replica, and an unnecessary one. The familiar pieces are in place, but it adds nothing that Greengrass hadn’t already accomplished. Maybe its best we let Jason Bourne retire for good."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,50,Jason Bourne adheres to an existing format so robotically that it never manages to surprise or engage for longer than the occasional passing moment.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,49,"Eventually, even perpetual pursuit gets dull, and Jason Bourne finds that point early, then just keeps charging monotonously forward."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is, but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"While the result is an often fast-moving and very Damon-y Jason Bourne, it doesn't at all feel as original or as well crafted as the series once did."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"Even when it comes to life, Jason Bourne offers very little that could stand on its own; its best scenes remind you of even better ones in the earlier films. There's a greatest-hits quality to the movie, only the band is tired and its heart isn't in it."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,40,"Once the story drags Bourne out of retirement, it's just a bunch of fights and chase scenes, only occasionally interrupted by a few lines of dialogue."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,38,"This stale, redundant story goes round in the same tight circles, revealing one piddling new secret and containing one unconvincing change of character."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,38,"One of the more admirable traits of the original Bourne trilogy is how little pleasure it takes in its violence, but Jason Bourne revels in its vicious action sequences."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,33,I've rarely seen so much effort for so little thrill.
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,33,"Simultaneously pretentious, mind-numbingly tedious, and dizzyingly incoherent from scene to scene, Jason Bourne is the definition of diminishing returns."
Jason Bourne,6.6,162434410,25,"The character motivations are weak, and the story is poorly structured. But its camera work, possibly intended to distract audiences from the movie’s flaws, only compounds its problems. It distances the audience and makes Jason Bourne a chore to sit through."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,88,"It's a pretty good ride even if it blatantly steals some of its best stunts from ""American Graffiti"" and ""Grease."""
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,75,"I found it more pleasurable as a time waster than either ""Mission: Impossible."""

Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,60,"This new version is mindless hot-rodding fun, especially for those with a weakness for vintage cars hurtling down city streets, a group whose members include -- sigh -- me."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,60,"This retread has been bloated far beyond its B-movie origins, beefed up with more characters and an all-star cast, stripped of any real suspense and loaded down with music cuts and one-liners aimed at pleasing a crowd of rowdy male teenagers."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,"The car stunts are ridiculous, all lightning-fast editing and computer enhancement -- by the time action is this far removed from reality, who cares?"
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,A time-waster with some enjoyably empty zip.

Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,"This film, a remake of a hapless 1974 cheapie of the same title, can't even get the big chase right."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,50,Interesting and idiotic elements almost exactly balance each other.
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,42,"I'll tell you what's gone in 60 seconds, all right: my attention."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,"There were moments when I thought Gone in 60 Seconds might be a passably entertaining movie.  I figure those moments, strung end-to-end, would total 30 or 40 seconds."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,"It's barely a movie at all, more like a thousand car commercials spliced together in an hour."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,40,A 119-minute trailer.

Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,"A mindless, cliche-riddled action-cartoon, a blur of metal and fire and screeching tires, with bad dialogue, cardboard characters and a volume set so high, it makes the Indianapolis 500 sound like chamber music."
Gone in Sixty Seconds,6.5,101648571,30,How did a dignified pro like Duvall get stuck in this fender-bender?

The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"Everything in The Lego Movie is, indeed, awesome."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The LEGO Movie is the kind of animated free-for-all that comes around very rarely, if ever: A kids’ movie that matches shameless fun with razor-sharp wit, that offers up a spectacle of pure, freewheeling joy even as it tackles the thorniest of issues."

The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"The Lego Movie is an absolute blast—a whip-smart, surprisingly emotional family film where the toy property is seen less as a concrete template than a tool for seemingly limitless potential."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,100,"It’s a non-stop blast from beginning to end, jam-packed with a wacky irreverence, dazzling state-of-the-art CGI (courtesy of Animal Logic) and a pitch-perfect voice cast headed by Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell."

The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"A wickedly smart and funny free-for-all, and sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,A marvelous piece of work.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"There are so many things to like about The Lego Movie: a great voice cast, clever dialogue and a handsome blend of stop-motion and CGI animation that feels lovingly retro, while still looking sharp in 21st-century 3-D. But the best thing about this movie... is its subversive nature."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,The first great cinematic experience of 2014.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,88,"The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the storyline is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it’s hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,83,"Just plain funny, loaded with joke after joke and pun after pun."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,83,"Effervescent in style, conveying a substantive message without ever devolving into saccharine preachiness."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,An unexpected joy.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"The Lego Movie maybe be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work — a cash grab with a heart. Made for, with and about Legos, the movie is also made for, with and about imagination, and when that association seems completely natural, it's a win all around."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"For a film that clearly required a small army to make, it often feels thrillingly off-the-cuff, which keeps with The Lego Movie’s themes of creativity and weirdness: Nobody’s following an instruction book with this one."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"The LEGO Movie is sheer joy: the script is witty, the satire surprisingly pointed and the animation tactile and imaginative."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"Ridiculously funny and meticulously detailed, The LEGO Movie is far better than a toy tie-in movie has any right to be. Despite a couple of dips, you’ll be grinning throughout."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,The Lego Movie is bursting out of its box with enthusiasm and excitement for the possibilities of a little pile of nubby plastic.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"For a shot of pure forward-leaping, backward-dreaming animated pleasure, pick brick."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,80,"Phil Lord and Christopher Miller irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,78,The film is one big advertisement for the multicolored building blocks from which it’s made. The Lego Movie may be the shrewdest marketing ploy you’ve ever seen.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,"No doubt, there is an uncomfortable number of logos being marketed to kids in the The Lego Movie, along with the obvious one that’s in the title, but the film as a whole is very much in the spirit of Cloud Cuckooland: It’s a place where the use of X-Acto blades and Krazy Glue breaks the rules but almost everything else goes."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,"The all-Lego adventure is warm and witty, showing flashes of satire."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,A manic and at times surprising comedy that has more imagination and creativity than all the Transformers pictures combined.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,75,The Lego Movie amuses and never fails to leave the viewer –especially adults — a little dazzled at the demented audacity of it all.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,63,"All told, there's an ageless warmth to The LEGO Movie akin to that of the LEGO brand itself."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,The Lego Film has a specialness all its own. There's never been a hodgepodge quite like it.
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"As full-length toy advertisements go, you really couldn’t ask for more."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,60,"The visual environment created by the filmmakers (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of “21 Jump Street” wrote and directed; the animation is by Animal Logic) hums with wit and imagination... The story is a busy, slapdash contraption designed above all to satisfy the imperatives of big-budget family entertainment."
The Lego Movie,7.8,257760692,50,"As cute and energetic as it is, The Lego Movie is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long. The action scenes are enthusiastic, colorful but uninvolving, like an 8-year-old emptying a bucket of plastic blocks."
Spy,7.0,110825712,100,"It's a comedy of exasperation where, for once, the joke isn't on McCarthy, but on everyone who can't see her skills."
Spy,7.0,110825712,90,"As McCarthy and Byrne carry on a filthy volley of insults (with what is surely secret sisterly glee), Feig keeps his Spy machinery cranking so smoothly that nothing said or done feels as outrageous as, in fact, it is. The truth serum Spy drops into our fizzy drinks makes us feel so good that we don’t even realize we’ve been schooled."
Spy,7.0,110825712,90,Spy lampoons sexism without abandoning sex — a tough tone for a comedy to strike but one that Feig and McCarthy manage to accomplish with both a sense of justice and a sense of humor.
Spy,7.0,110825712,90,"It is, in short, a generous, smart, sexy comedy, surrounding this generous, smart, sexy star. About time."
Spy,7.0,110825712,90,"Laugh-stuffed and making excellent use of its marquee-grade supporting cast, it promises to be a home run in its early summer release."
Spy,7.0,110825712,90,An uproarious blast of globe-trotting action-comedy delirium that doesn’t spoof the espionage-thriller genre so much as drop a series of banana peels in its path.
Spy,7.0,110825712,88,"Feig, who wrote the Spy screenplay, encouraging his actors to improvise along the way, has his own stealth mission. For all the over-the-top comedy, zigzagging chases, and choreographed fight scenes, Spy is very much a tale of female empowerment."
Spy,7.0,110825712,88,"All the actors come up aces. And let's bottle the delicious byplay between McCarthy and Byrne, whose comic timing is bitchy perfection."
Spy,7.0,110825712,83,"McCarthy’s mind just seems to race in a faster gear than her costars, allowing her to blast off arias of profane put-downs with such speed and demented originality that her mouth practically shoots sparks. As a physical comedian, she possesses the greatest gift of all: She’s totally unafraid of looking stupid."
Spy,7.0,110825712,83,"There is a giddy sense of glee that runs through most of this movie, making it feel like Feig can barely contain himself with all of the things he wants to do and show you in the movie."
Spy,7.0,110825712,82,"Spy would be a standout if only for its ability to keep me laughing while also keeping me from figuring out who was really double-crossing whom. Add to that this extraordinary ensemble of actors (who knew Jason Statham could be this funny?), and you’ve got another memorable offering from McCarthy and Feig."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"Spy may not be a great movie, but it is great fun. And at times it will have you wondering if there's that much of a difference."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"Spy is hilarious and heartfelt, a terrific movie."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"Spy never lets its genre conceit get in the way of its comedy, which delivers more laugh-out-loud moments than any other mainstream comedy so far this year."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"The busy, silly script allows Ms. McCarthy to be her own best sidekick, in effect an entire sketch-comedy troupe unto herself."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"A whip-smart blend of savvy parody, elegant slapstick and zinger-packed dialogue makes for the year’s most rewarding character comedy so far, and McCarthy’s best showcase to date."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"The supporting cast is a kick. Law gets to send up the Bond role, something he could very well have played in his younger days; Allison Janney fills her boots as the angry head of the agency and Statham, frankly, should only ever play this role for the rest of his life."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"Spy confirms Feig’s and McCarthy’s instinct for both the zeitgeist and the funnybone, and is sure to ramp up anticipation for Ghostbusters even higher – as well as being a delight in its own right."
Spy,7.0,110825712,80,"This is a generous, consistently pleasurable comedy."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,Nobody is better than McCarthy at over-the-top comic hostility.
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"As a distaff version of James Bond in Spy, Hollywood’s reigning empress of ha-ha Melissa McCarthy has a license to not just kill the audience with laughter but also to slay us with her acting skills."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"Feig blends a keen sense of physical comedy and exquisite timing with all the requisite spy-flick tropes, from the trippy and stylish opening credits to surprisingly violent, bone-breaking action scenes that he refrains from playing for laughs."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"Spy is a foul-mouthed, often hilariously disgusting, slightly padded comedy that soars on the strengths of writer-director Paul Feig’s wonderfully idiotic script and nimble camerawork, and the bountiful comedic talents of Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne and Jason Statham."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,The character is sweetly sympathetic — less “Tammy” than “Mike & Molly” — and the laughs and chaos are all the more infectious for it.
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"The fun of Spy comes in watching the right actors mess with their own images, blithely."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"Spy, similarly, doesn’t exactly send up James Bond or Jason Bourne espionage thrillers, but it places McCarthy in the middle of the action while subverting the traditionally male domination of that arena."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"It's the sustained, full-bodied mania of Melissa McCarthy's performance that anchors the film's many winning blind-alley gags."
Spy,7.0,110825712,75,"Feig's commitment to the genre, and some truly wonderful set pieces, make Spy as lovable as its main character."
Spy,7.0,110825712,70,"McCarthy has much more to discover about herself as an actor and an avatar and a cultural signifier, and I hope she doesn’t get trapped by one role, one genre or one franchise. But her campaign of conquest is going well."
Spy,7.0,110825712,67,"Some of the combat scenes work, including a kitchen-set hand-to-hand battle that's one of the movie's highlights, but more often they feel superfluous at best."
Spy,7.0,110825712,63,"The problem is that writer/director Paul Feig became too enamored with his storyline which, at best, could be described as a lame James Bond parody."
Spy,7.0,110825712,63,"As cinema, Spy is content to cater to its own conventions, hit the required marks and earn a few laughs along the way. As a cultural bellwether, it does something bigger and more important, without ever italicizing that fact."
Spy,7.0,110825712,63,"The fights and deaths are somewhat comical, the one-liners hit or miss and the stunts faked with less sleight of hand than a director experienced in action might have managed. And Feig can’t bear to end this thing, which goes on far past the point of endurance. But he’s done better by McCarthy here, and she has delivered a performance that’s more deft than her usual daft."
Spy,7.0,110825712,60,"Spy boasts tons of the type of low-humor that fuel so many Seth Rogen and Will Ferrell frat-boy movies. The difference here is that the laughs aren't at the expense of the fat kid. By the time the closing credits roll, McCarthy's character been built up, not torn down -- and we're rooting for her, not guffawing at her."
Spy,7.0,110825712,60,"Feig keeps throwing so much stuff at you — gross-out gags, chases, brutal violence, not to mention actors working their heads off — that he finally wears down your resistance. In the end, I admired him for keeping this ramshackle construction together, casting performers I adore, and proving that Melissa McCarthy can, indeed, hold a gun. A mixed victory. A definitively mixed review."
Spy,7.0,110825712,60,The moments when Spy falls apart are when the film fancies itself the real thing. The times when it works are due to its leading lady.
Spy,7.0,110825712,60,"Though it’s been two years since they collaborated on ""The Heat,"" Spy makes the case that Feig and McCarthy are still just warming up."
Spy,7.0,110825712,50,"This is a different sort of comedy that more or less succeeds on its own terms, despite that fact that you find yourself rooting for the post-Snowden CIA."
Spy,7.0,110825712,50,"Alas, “sad case” is not how we want to see McCarthy; it’s frustrating to see her spend more than half the movie being the pathetic target of jokes rather than the dominating figure she was in “Bridesmaids” and “The Heat,” both of which are far funnier than this one."
Spy,7.0,110825712,38,"With the overlong, limp and lazy Spy, Feig has lost his mojo."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,75,"It is a satisfying but thoroughly idiotic film, in which relationships make no sense, character motivations change on a dime, and Tom Hanks has weird hair. But brainless as it is, it’s artful. It is a well-made bit of silliness, a piece of construction optimally designed to maintain audience interest while garnering absolutely no one’s respect."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,75,Inferno delivers as an engaging thriller that I frankly enjoyed far more than Howard’s last Brown outing.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,75,"Bourne it is not, but the twists come with enough regularity to keep the squishier parts of the plot from mucking up the works."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,70,"It's fair to say that Inferno won't be for everyone, but those who have stuck through Howard and Hanks' previous Dan Brown adaptations should find enough thrills to keep them interested in solving the mystery."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,70,"Koepp has managed a brisk adaptation, although some of the dialogue can feel very forced, particularly when it comes to the clue-solving set-ups. Still, Howard keeps the viewer constantly occupied, Felicity Jones is an engaging sidekick, and there’s clearly a lot more mileage left for Tom Hanks in this franchise’s tank."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,70,"Although some of the film’s many twists are not that surprising, they’re satisfyingly delivered, and with a strong supporting cast ...plus striking dream imagery, this adds up to arguably the best in the franchise so far."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,67,Returning director Ron Howard somewhat belabors the Botticelli-inspired hallucinations Langdon suffers from following a konk on the head – though you really can’t oversell the creepiness of a beaky plague mask – but he continues to have an inspired hand in casting his supporting players.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,63,"Perhaps Howard’s dutiful obligation to Brown’s treasure-hunt oeuvre will end here, with the temperate Inferno sparking a resurgence to follow. Dante wrote that “The poets leave hell and again behold the stars.” Here’s hoping that Howard has some shine left in him."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,63,"Inferno is the exact cinematic equivalent of an airport paperback, which is what’s fine and forgettable about it."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,60,Early promise proves misleading in a sequel that should be far better than The Da Vinci Code than it actually is.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,58,"This latest film, which was made on about half the budget of either of its predecessors, is as close as the Langdon-Howard cycle has gotten to actually being fun."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,58,"The first two — The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons — left much to be desired. This one emerges as a marked improvement, though that’s not saying a whole lot."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Whatever inspired the compulsively addictive (I assume) fast-selling book series isn’t found in yet another dull, tiresome race-against-the-clock European mystery thriller with a historical twist."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The most interesting character and performance come from the great Indian actor Iffran Khan (“Life of Pi,” “Jurassic World,” “The Lunchbox”). He brings a wonderful world weariness to this “dark money” criminal mastermind."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Unless you are a Dante scholar, and perhaps not even then, following Inferno is a wild goose chase – without the goose."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Part of the draw of these movies is that they don’t create beauty, but instead borrow the emotions of the beauty they depict. (This, more or less, is one definition of kitsch, courtesy of the philosopher Tomas Kulka.) That makes the movies easy to watch and easy to forget."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The film is never gripping, but at least it moves. Director Ron Howard does his best to spark excitement with cheesy horror-movie editing — brief shots of the damnation in store if the virus is unleashed — and there are a couple of twists to keep things lively. Nothing is what it seems, unless it seems ridiculous, in which case it’s exactly what it seems."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The ""Da Vinci Code"" was adequate but forgettable. ""Angels & Demons"" was godawful. Inferno is somewhere in between - watchable but by no means worth the money and effort necessary to see it theatrically."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,Don’t get burned by Inferno.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"It's not that ""Inferno"" as it stands doesn't provide hints of better things. The plot has its share of unexpected twists, peripheral characters hold our attention, wide-screen vistas of tourist destinations Florence, Venice and Istanbul are easy to take, and stories involving the end of the world have a certain built-in interest. But as presented on screen, none of this gels as it should."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Inferno is another docent tour dressed as an action movie, a baby boomer's fantasy of travel and intrigue."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The multiple twists, double-crosses and leaps in logic are more likely to prompt giggles than gasps, despite the impressive production values and the earnest efforts of an A-list cast."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Ron Howard, who’s tied to this franchise like a man trapped in a decaying house by a huge mortgage, tries without success to blow life into David Koepp’s script."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"The chase, chase, chase pace is tiring, not least because it’s not clear who many of these people are and what agendas they’re following. Mixed-up confusion is the result."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,50,"Even with a wealth of talent involved, Inferno is missing some serious heat."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,42,"When it was all over, I found myself googling Dante for my own clue as to what I’d just suffered: “He who knows most grieves most for wasted time.”"
Inferno,6.2,34343574,42,"Inferno, much like its predecessors, simply can’t work its way out of the disappointing middle ground between a slick, technically competent thriller and tongue-in-cheek absurdity."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,42,"If the first film was ploddingly, airlessly faithful to its source, this follows the second in being frantically paced, chaotic and increasingly exasperating."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Tom Hanks takes his art down a peg with another paycheck performance as the dramatic cipher Robert Langdon in Inferno, Ron Howard’s mostly lame adaptation of Dan Brown’s wholly lame novel."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"This gets to be exhausting, since there’s hardly a scene that isn’t manipulative or assaultive."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Inferno feels every bit like the second sequel in an exhausted franchise, stunted by unfocused storytelling and a blandness that's almost sleep-inducing."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Inferno...is the kind of movie that stops — and stoops — to explain, early and often. Not that the explanations amount to much; the movie makes almost no sense."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"Howard's film, particularly early on, ends up being too fast, too dense and too smart for its own good. Keeping moviegoers guessing is one thing. Keeping them confused is quite another."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"It’s not the worst of the trilogy, but this is less for fans of thrillers and more for people who are pining after last year’s holiday to Florence."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"By the end, even Hanks looks a bit bored."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,40,"There’s a stern, let’s-get-to-work air to the film’s craft and conception that hampers whatever thrill of the chase “Inferno” has to offer. Fundamentally silly the film may be, but it never graduates to spryness."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,38,"Hanks is one of the most likable actors on the planet. But Inferno just lays there onscreen, pancake-flat and with no animating spark to make us give a damn."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,38,"The more movie magic Howard piles on, the less we care. And, boy, does he pull out all the stops, stocking the pic with a tub of red herrings, half a dozen plot twists, and more complex set pieces than a comic-book flick. I felt relieved when it was finally over."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,38,This is a franchise with lead weights tied around its ankles.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,37,"Say what you will about Dan Brown’s books. They may be, as some have noted, poorly written, formulaic and pretentious. But at least they hold a reader’s attention, in ways that this excursion — as sleep-inducing and rigidly predictable as a train ride — does not."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,30,"The Da Vinci Code wasn’t Da Vinci, but it was an actual movie with texture and characters. Inferno is dumbed down to a shocking degree."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,25,It's impossible to even laugh at Inferno given how Ron Howard reduces the material to a dull spectacle of earnest puzzle-solving.
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"Like The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons before it, Inferno stumbles into the same pitfalls of convoluted plotting, kindergarten art history and conspiracy theories of the daytime-slot-on-the-Discovery-Channel sort."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"While the plot’s endless lurches and jinks are designed to hold you in a constant state of pleasurable bafflement, the cumulative effect is desensitisation: no single thread holds long enough to give you anything to cheer for or believe in."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"Ron Howard allows all manner of contrivances to pile up in David Koepp‘s screenplay, as if relying on constant reference to Dante’s Divine Comedy would make people think, “Ooh, this is clever stuff.”"
Inferno,6.2,34343574,20,"Once upon a time, this wackiness had some novelty value. Now it’s tedious."
Inferno,6.2,34343574,10,Take the Dan Brown out of a Dan Brown movie and all you’re left with is Tom Hanks jogging in mild irritation.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,75,The Great Wall has significant problems — namely with Damon and sidekick Pedro Pascal's lack of bromantic chemistry — but chief among its rewards is its ability to marry its Eastern and Western sensibilities.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,70,"As pure spectacle, The Great Wall is absolutely dazzling. It may be a studio release, but the constant sense of invention, the go-for-broke intricacy of its battle scenes, feels very much of a piece with Chinese action fantasy flicks."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,70,The absurdity is what makes it such a hoot-and-a-half.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,70,Viewers are in good hands — if they’re not too demanding — as Zhang Yimou puts the easily distinguishable characters through their paces.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,67,"If The Great Wall is too spotty to really satisfy as the old-fashioned medieval adventure it sometimes aspires to be, it is consistently engaging as an almost abstract exercise in visual sumptuousness."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,63,The Great Wall defies any expectations — it’s absolutely bonkers wild.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,63,"This is an often beautiful film, unmistakably the work of a great director but also a clearly compromised one."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,60,"If you calibrate your expectations to “monster movie for eight-year-olds,” you may find some fun in this energetic and blissfully brief (a mere 103 minutes!) tale of the Chinese army battling alien beasties in the Song Dynasty era."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,60,The Great Wall is not exactly a good movie – but it’s a pretty enjoyable one.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,60,"It won’t be remembered as Zhang’s best film, but the director’s artistic touch is on display in his long panoramic sweeps and artful use of colour. Simultaneously futuristic and historic, the visual spectacle carries the film."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,58,"The Great Wall doesn't have the lunacy that made last year's Gods of Egypt a hoot. Zhang can't kick his craving for respectability, even if he's making a movie that flips the middle finger at historicity."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,58,The Hollywood-infused epic fantasy plays like Warcraft meets The Last Samurai by way of Zack Snyder — but shockingly better than all that sounds.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,58,"There is barely a whiff of genuine transcendence in this grand-scale extravaganza. The special effects are courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic, but the magic here is largely industrial."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,58,"The Great Wall looks like it could be a really amazing video game. Alas, it’s a movie, and kind of a brick."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,12 year old boys will love the result. That’s not a good sign for anyone who has passed beyond their teenage years.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,The Great Wall is a so-so movie with eye-popping images.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,Zhang’s apocalyptic view of the beasts from above as they swarm over the palace like rats may be a chilling metaphor for what awaits us all if we don’t achieve effective international co-operation – but it is also the too-hasty climax to an underdeveloped martial-arts/monster-movie mashup. East and West are going to have to do better than this.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,"The Great Wall is like the disaster of 47 Ronin all over again, except the action is a bit more fantastically barbaric and Damon isn't all that bad himself."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,"For Yimou’s colors alone, and one particularly striking set piece set in a kaleidoscopic stained-glass tower, The Great Wall may be worth the price of admission."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,"It may be a second-rate “Lord of the Rings,” but at least it doesn’t overstay its welcome."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,50,"Director Zhang Yimou capably gives period fantasy-action The Great Wall the look and feel of a Hollywood blockbuster, but his signature visual dazzle, his gift for depicting delicate relationships and throbbing passions are trampled by dead-serious epic aspirations."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,42,"Other than the enjoyably silly banter between Damon and Pascal, there are few moments that endear you to anyone on screen. The movie’s tone veers from bombastic to goofy with speed but little grace."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,40,"Its real accomplishment is that, with so much money behind it and a true visionary at the helm, it manages to feel so dated."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,40,"A murky mishmash of a movie, with the lightest smattering of glorious moments."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,40,"The Great Wall flirts with romance and bleats out a little propagandistic blather about the benefits of bilateral action, but the focus throughout remains on multitudes of shifting, surging bodies — human and beast, digital and not — that, as they ebb and flow, resemble a Chinese military pageant and a lavish Busby Berkeley number."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,40,"It sure is handsome-looking, throwing off a majestic gleam. But that’s not the same as possessing actual majesty. There’s barely a minute when The Great Wall doesn’t veer into the trying-too-hard zone, and to watch all that striving is simply exhausting."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,40,"There are plenty of fun CGI monster-skewering scenes, but a clunky plot, rigid script and equally stiff acting make this a crumbling disappointment, if not quite a disaster."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,40,"The characters are ciphers, the narrative is dull and even the sights and sounds become numbingly bombastic after a while."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,38,"It plays like like a video game in which the goal is to kill as many of these green-blooded monsters as you can before time's up. It's fun for about 10 minutes, and then the tedium seeps in."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,38,"The Great Wall crumbles mainly because of its wholly predictable plot, wretched dialogue and dud of a filmgoing experience from noted director Zhang Yimou (House of Flying Daggers)."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,38,We will see worse movies this year than The Great Wall. But we won’t one more cynical.
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,38,"The Great Wall is so fantastically misguided and so wonderfully bad, I could see some coming for the action and staying for the camp laughs."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,30,"Whether it’s a case of miscasting is unclear, but without a willing hero to anchor this already dubious movie from start to finish, The Great Wall hits a brick wall."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,30,"You can try to enjoy The Great Wall as a delightfully crappy blockbuster, but when you remember this is a Zhang Yimou film, it’s just a disappointment."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,30,"If ever a film was made with more money than sense, this is it."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,25,"A bad movie by any culture’s standards, The Great Wall mostly goes to show that if the future of the business lies with Hollywood -China alliances, it doesn’t bode well for either side."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,25,"The narrative is clumsy, and the monster scenes are ridiculous, but not ridiculous enough to be funny, just ridiculous enough to be boring."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,20,"While it shows fleeting moments of promise, there's precious little great about The Great Wall. Instead, it should be called ""The Ridiculous Wall."""
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,20,"The computer-generated monsters, like the film as a whole, are numbingly repetitive, and devoid of any power to move, scare or stir us."
The Great Wall,6.0,45540830,20,"From blundered opening to risible conclusion, it’s a wall-to-wall fiasco."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,75,"It's done with an agreeable confidence and flair, the actors all fit comfortably in their roles and the effects are fun."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,75,"Blessedly unimportant, Fantastic Four cruises along on modest yet genuine comic-book pleasures."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,70,"A funky, fun film version of the famous Marvel superhero concoction, one of the earliest of the revisionist wave of supes and in some ways the most lovable or at least the most knowable."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,63,"Frustrating because it doesn't seem far removed from a wholly enjoyable motion picture, but the tempo's off, beats are missed, and the production ends up sounding out-of-tune."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,63,"I don't think it will seriously disappoint longtime fans, but it made me itchy as I watched it unfold in ways that the comics never did when I read them in the '60s."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,63,"In a summer of low movie expectations and worse results, Fantastic Four is a not-so-bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn't try to eclipse its dime-store comic book roots."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,60,"Michael Chiklis (of the cop show ""The Shield"") steals the movie as the agonized Thing."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"This clumsy, cheesy, chintzy adaptation, with its F/X that look dated the moment you see them, is like something left over from the '60s."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"A wildly uneven, sporadically slapdash action-adventure that amuses in fits and starts."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"This ""Four"" ain't so ""Fantastic."""
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"Even if you can get past the acting -- and in the case of the beautiful, blank Alba, that's asking a lot -- the film just sits there, not exactly torturous, but never very exciting, either."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"It's fun to watch superheroes who aren't quite at ease with their abilities, but ""The Incredibles"" - last year's similarly themed animated film - is livelier and funnier."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"Fails to be anything more than a mild summertime diversion. Based on the Marvel comic book, it's a prototypical air conditioner movie."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,There's nothing terribly fantastic about this ho-hum futuristic foray.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"It's a waste of classic material. Rent ""The Incredibles"" and see what should have been."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,"Fantastic Four doesn't expand on, or even illuminate, anything much beyond the most basic theme of what it feels like to be an adolescent misfit. This is a comic-book movie that actually makes an effort not to go over kids' heads."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,50,A garish mediocrity.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"A comic-book movie unashamed of its roots, meaning it's unabashed about being silly, overwrought nonsense, which works to its benefit--so much so that you're almost rooting for it by the end."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of ""Batman Begins,"" Fantastic Four is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,A colossal snore.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,Favors light action over character dynamics.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,The release of Fantastic Four marks the beginning of the end for movies based on Marvel Comics' upper tier of characters.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"After this mediocrity, no one's even going to remember Roger Corman's godawful bargain-basement 1994 version. Which, on second thought, had a lot more heart that this one."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,40,"Fleetingly enjoyable in very short bursts, this is the most cynically constructed event movie in recent memory, its heart purely in its wallet. A fantastic bore."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,38,There's nothing remotely fantastic about this Fantastic Four.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,38,"It needed a star like Clooney at its center, and a character actor like Alan Rickman as Dr. Doom. You don't expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"Directing seems an unduly elegant term for what Hollywood hack du jour Tim Story (Barbershop, Taxi) does here -- the action scenes are so choppily constructed that their excitement disappears faster than the Invisible Woman."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"An overinflated B-movie with no grace, no subtext, no wit, and featuring beefcake/cheesecake actors who look like they've been plucked from the soaps."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"The action sequences reek of drudgery rather than adventure, and with the exception of Chiklis's remarkably soulful performance beneath 60 pounds of orange Thing makeup, all of the characters are flatter than their two-dimensional counterparts."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,30,"The really good superhero movies, like ""Superman,"" ""SpiderMan 2"" and ""Batman Begins,"" leave Fantastic Four so far behind that the movie should almost be ashamed to show itself in the same theaters."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,"A perfect storm of wooden acting, hackneyed direction, inane scripting and laughably cartoonish special effects produces a shapeless mess more wearyingly stupid than arch-villian Dr. Doom is evil."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,What the movie lacks most is a real sense of adventure.
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,"They take on special powers that the filmmakers are incapable of making interesting, partly because the characters are ciphers, and partly because the story is listless and uninventive."
Fantastic Four,5.7,154696080,25,"From less a purist's standpoint than a seeker of serviceable junk food, this comprehensive waste of time is too bouncy to be an ""Elektra"" bummer, but should make Marvel mascot Stan Lee think twice about burning another lucrative bridge with unintentional hilarity."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,63,Everyone knows how the battles will turn out. It's what's between them that raises Masters Of The Universe ever so slightly above the mediocre.
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,63,"If you liked the toy, you'll love the movie."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,50,"There are some decent special effects, but overall it's about what you'd expect from a movie inspired by a line of toys."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,50,"A misfiring, underdone epic that takes its inspiration not from life or literature, but from a toy line and the cartoon series it inspired."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,40,"Little kids at play have come up with craftier plots, better characterization and conceivably more spectacular effects -- provided their mothers let them play with matches."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,30,"The first film to be based on a line of toys, this might not be the last, but it'd take something awful to replace it as the worst."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,20,"I'm not going to lie to you here, this movie is a steaming pile of you-know-what. The acting is horrendous, the story is the most cookie-cutter clone of every movie after Star Wars as you can get, and the effects are downright laughable. Even an easy effect such as a laser blast looks bad here."
Masters of the Universe,5.4,17336370,20,"All elements are of epic proportions in this Conan-Star Wars hybrid ripoff, based on the best-selling line of children’s toys. Epitome of Good takes on Epitome of Evil for nothing less than the future of the Universe, and the result is a colossal bore."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,90,"Take my word for it, or better yet go find out for yourself: Big Hero 6 is a treat."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,90,"East meets West to immensely satisfying effect in the vibrant mash-up of an animated romp, Big Hero 6."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,89,"Sweet and sharp and exciting and hilarious, Big Hero 6 comes to the rescue of what's become a dreaded movie trope — the origin story — and launches the superhero tale to pleasurable new heights."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,88,It’s a movie that’s as fun to watch as it is funny. But the real appeal of Big Hero 6 isn’t its action. It’s the central character’s heart.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,88,"With a film this funny, exciting and visually stimulating, who cares if you know exactly what's going to happen next, and when."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,88,"The storytelling is solid, propelled by characters that you come to care about."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,83,"At times, Big Hero 6 gets a little too noisy for its own good, but that never manages to drown out its many quieter charms."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,83,"Whatever flaws it has are ones of over-enthusiasm and over-ambition and are therefore easy to forgive, especially because when it works, it really works."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"After ""Frozen,"" Disney delivers a heart-melter. The sweet, witty main pairing focuses a potentially busy, derivative super-group tale. Stay for the sting: Big Hero 7 is practically a given."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"The Scooby-Doo-ish central plot is forgivable in a movie with so much visual verve, energetic action and a character so wondrously designed as Baymax."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"Amid all the nerd-inspired firepower that gives the movie much of its flash, the big boy's droning tone proves to be the film's stealth weapon, perfect for pulling off highly targeted comic strikes."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,Big Hero 6 is good enough to transcend its blah ending and to make the case that every superhero story should be entirely animated.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"It ultimately amounts to a feature-length origin story, but with characters this unknown and execution this fun, that’s an asset, not a liability."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"Big Hero 6 was executive produced by Pixar guru John Lasseter. You can see the influence in the high quality, from the appealing 3D animation to the unusually sharp story and script (a cooperative effort credited to seven people)."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,80,"A melding of old and new modes of animation, in which the attentive artistry of the past coexists with the hyper-detailed, computer-generated present."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,78,"Another friggin’ superhero story that acknowledges comic-book tropes while rarely subverting them, Big Hero 6 is powered nonetheless by its witty charms, lively animation, and swift pace."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"This one's a winner. And Baymax, baby, call your agent. You're about to be a household name."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"Although competently made and consistently engaging, there's nothing special about this animated superhero origin story."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"An action adventure that puts brain ahead of brawn as a valued commodity is always reason to celebrate. Add in the considerable heart that Baymax contributes (with elements borrowed from both “WALL-E” and “Up”), and you have a winner."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,The most endearing character in Disney's animated superhero animated movie is a one-man Affordable Care Act. (Make that a one-robot ACA.)
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,A rousing movie that’s satisfyingly infused with traditional Disney sentiment.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"Big Hero 6 is second-tier Disney/Marvel entertainment, fine for a day out with the children yet doesn't seem enough, after the creative advances of Wreck-It Ralph and the emotional heft of Frozen."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,The visuals are splendid. Even close-ups of face and hair are something to marvel at.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"Without making a big deal out of it, Big Hero 6 features a shrewdly balanced and engaging group of male and female characters of various ethnic backgrounds. It'd be nice to live in a world where this wasn't worth a mention, but it is. And yet the movie belongs to the big guy."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"It’s manipulative and overlong, too loud and “Incredibles” action-packed for the very young. But the manipulation errs on the side of mercy, compassion, sacrifice and humanity."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,75,"As much as the action stuff works and would indicate that any other property Marvel entrusts to the animation side of things is in good hands, Big Hero 6 gets by more on the charms of its comedy."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,70,"Therein lies part of the dissonance with this often-wonderful, deceptively strange movie. You could get emotional whiplash watching it."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,70,Big Hero 6 is easier to admire than to love. It veers from chipper to noisy to dark stretches where it grapples with adult-sized grief.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,70,"After establishing its fresh and relatable origin story, the movie gets bogged down with a relatively generic villain’s power-hungry schemes. Still, there’s enough that’s new and different about Big Hero 6 to get excited about, especially for those still too young for Marvel’s more intense live-action fare."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,67,Big Hero 6’s considerable graces as an animated film — its fantastical layouts and bouncy sense of figure and motion — are offset by its deficiencies as a second-rate superhero flick.
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,63,"Gorgeous and disturbing, Big Hero 6 is a departure for Disney: a film targeted at older kids, and the studio's first venture into straight-up comic book culture. Walt would flip in his cryogenic chamber if he saw this anime-style production."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,63,"Consider it a more family-friendly ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" with the added kiddie appeal of a big, inflatable windbag to laugh at and love."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,63,"The film quickly becomes a study of grief and retribution, and the question of how exactly technology can and should be utilized in the treatment of these emotions."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"It is, after all, the Baymax show - and he is cute, cuddly, comedy gold. Fortunately, although Big Hero 6 has various flaws, he's generally on hand to patch them."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"Especially when Baymax is onscreen doing his adorable-puffy-robot thing, Big Hero 6 qualifies as a better-than-average kids’ movie with enough cross-generational appeal to make it a fine choice for a family weekend matinee. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that this film was designed to function as a starter kit for future Marvel aficionados."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"As far as 'toons go, it's probably most reminiscent of Pixar's ""The Incredibles,"" given that both are stories about superhero teams. There are also echoes of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" in the flying scenes, featuring little Hiro perched atop Baymax's back. But even then, Big Hero 6 still feels like its own, distinct creature."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,60,"The animation is fluid and inventive, balancing action and slapstick with aplomb."
Big Hero 6,7.8,222527828,50,"Big Hero 6 even has a title that sounds like a product ordered off the takeout menu of the type of restaurant that recombines a few elements in many ways. That could work fine, if any of the ingredients were particularly flavorful."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,100,"Director James Cameron always works on a mega- canvas, yet he's brought off something unique here."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,90,Much of the appeal of True Lies comes from the smooth grafting of battle-of-the-sexes comedy onto a high-tech action picture.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,88,One of the best things about True Lies is that it's genuinely funny.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,88,"On the surface, True Lies is an affectionate homage to James Bond movies, ratcheted up to meet the action/adventure expectations of today's audiences."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,83,True Lies is so eager to give you a giddy good time that you're more than happy to let it work you over. It's a likably disposable pop cocktail.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,80,"The net result is unbeatably good fun, helped along by that inherent fantasy that one man can create global mayhem without stopping to worry who's going to clean up afterwards."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,80,"The director, James Cameron, is a master of action (he worked with Schwarzenegger on ""Terminator 2""), and when he's doing his thing, no one does it better."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,75,"The comedy is extremely broad (with Curtis eliciting almost as many laughs as Schwarzenegger), the action sequences are as well crafted as one can expect from Cameron, and the meaning is as root basic as anyone would wish."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,70,This mixture of comedy and super-agent spectacle works well at first. But when Schwarzenegger's family and working worlds link up -- an inevitable development -- the plot becomes increasingly ridiculous and overwrought.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,70,"The catch is, once you get past the stunning special effects and the mind-numbing stuntwork, there's not all that much there."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,60,"Deceptively labeled a domestic epic by writer-director James Cameron, the $100 million movie is, in fact, a weird hybrid of action juggernaut, buddy cop caper and reactionary soft-core pornography."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,50,For a viewer sympathetic to Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's best selves -- the ironist with muscles and the mordant fabulist -- True Lies is a loud misfire. It rarely brings its potent themes to life.
True Lies,7.2,146282411,50,"Yet even with its ribald laughs and spectacular action sequences (clearly seeking to up the ante on the latter front), the movie gets mired in a comedic midsection that wears the audience down, sapping their energy before the film shifts to a chaotic third act that just doesn't know when to quit."
True Lies,7.2,146282411,50,"The tale begins and ends in a flurry of joke violence; Cameron has decided to spoof what he used to take seriously, and the result, though bright and deafening, feels oddly slack -- he loosens the screws, and our interest drops away."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,100,"Batman Returns could mark a happy beginning for Hollywood -- not because it might make a mint but because it dispenses with realism and aspires to animation, to the freedom of idea and image found in the best feature-length cartoons."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,91,I find it the most adventurous and imaginative American film I've seen this year - and also the weirdest.
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,88,"Like the hero himself, the movie is larger than life - a horrific fantasy that gets carried away with itself as the mood builds and the tension mounts"
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,80,"Burton has once again managed to pursue his quirky personal concerns in the context of broadly commercial entertainment, although the idiosyncracies of the villains clearly interest him far more than the programmable heroics of the title character and the related mandatory action sequences."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,80,Burton continues to capture the essence of the Batman legend and more importantly his audiences imagination.
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,80,"To come out of the summer haze and enter the dark (and cool) wonder of Batman Returns is a pleasure not to be denied. Even more than before, this cartoon opera about cloistered personalities bathes exultantly in moody blues, gothic music swirls and a symphony of character tragedy."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,80,"Visually, Batman Returns is marvelous to behold. There are images on that screen that make you laugh with delight and admiration for the sheer imaginativeness of it. But Burton also brings up some really interesting themes only to lose interest somewhere along the way."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,78,"This baby takes place in Tim Burton's id. It's a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,75,Our rooting interest is not for any macho act by Batman to save the city but for each character to achive some sort of emotional peace. That makes for a strange but refreshing action story.
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,75,Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams.
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,75,"This demented toyshop of a movie is a bit of a mess, but it's a visionary mess. Of how many sequels can that be said?"
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,75,"Mr. Burton's new Batman Returns is as sprightly as its predecessor was sluggish, and it succeeds in banishing much of the dourness and tedium that made the first film such an ordeal."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,70,"Batman Returns offers many jolts of pleasure, yet it’s also a mess — a gilded sketchbook of a movie that keeps falling open to random pages."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,70,"As Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands reminded us, Burton always has been more absorbed by what his audience sees than by what his movies say. It's part of his unique talent as a filmmaker, but it leads him to ignore the flaws in the structure of what is, after all, supposed to be an exciting adventure film."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,67,"I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more of a misguided one, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a Batman story."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,63,"Batman Returns, the most eagerly awaited and aggressively hyped film of the summer, is, for better and worse, very much the product of director Tim Burton's morose imagination. His dark, melancholy vision is undeniably something to see, but it is a claustrophobic conception, not an expansive one, oppressive rather than exhilarating, and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying."
Batman Returns,7.0,162831698,63,"Director Tim Burton and his screenwriters bring a heavy-handed, plodding realism to bear on what should be pop-mythic material."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,100,One of the best war movies of the past 20 years.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,88,"""Black Hawk Down"" was criticized because the characters seemed hard to tell apart. We Were Soldiers doesn't have that problem; in the Hollywood tradition it identifies a few key players, casts them with stars, and follows their stories."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,88,"The in-your-face style of We Were Soldiers results in a suspenseful, intense, and exhausting cinematic experience."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,83,"A powerful experience, filled with dazzlingly executed action sequences that generally avoid the rock music and drugged-out conventions of ""Apocalypse Now,"" and even exude a certain core of humanity."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,83,"The film's soldiers are more the mom-and-apple-pie, God-fearing lads of World War II movies than the cynical grunts of ""Platoon"" (1986) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987)."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,You don't really watch the film; you survive it.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"Gibson may get top billing, but it's Sam Elliott who steals all the scenes. As Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley, a man who fires with his own .45 revolver rather than the standard M-16 rifles, he's full of hilariously colorful comments."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"Like the best war movies -- and like martial literature going back to the Iliad -- it balances the dreadful, unassuageable cruelty of warfare and the valor and decency of those who fight."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"It succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides. That might not make it a milestone, but it's a hell of an improvement."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,80,"This is a good film; strong, honest, strikingly photographed (by Dean Semler) and appropriately devastating."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"The writer-director bestows honor -- generously, apolitically -- not only on the dead and still living American veterans who fought in Ia Drang, but also on their families, on their Vietnamese adversaries, and on the families of their adversaries too."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,This also is the rare combat movie that deals substantially with mourning widows on the home front.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,Probably the best thing you can say about We Were Soldiers is that it does justice to an awful conflict.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"Manages to evoke a complex series of reactions. It both frustrates with its unrelenting sentimentality and impresses with the overwhelming physicality of its combat sequences. These in turn are so powerful they take on a life of their own, sending a message that is probably quite opposite to the one the filmmakers intended."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,75,"Isn't a great movie; I'd say it's barely a good one. But it's a war movie that at least acknowledges the distinction between macho and masculinity, always putting the dignity of the latter over the bluster of the former."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"Gibson has the closest thing to a John Wayne part that anyone's played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset, and he plays it damn well."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"It's square, stiff, and in places cheesy; it's also authentically harrowing -- and blood-showered, blood-drowned."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"Soldiers is righteously explicit about the damage artillery does to human flesh, and for its part, it proves relentlessly unpleasant."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"The battle, expertly shot by Dean Semler, captures the chaos of guerrilla warfare paralleled in ""Black Hawk Down"" and gives the film a scarring documentary realism."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"If the action is graphic and immediate, other aspects of the movie are inexcusably bad."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,"One admires Wallace's intentions while despairing at his execution. Yet as clumsily directed as his film is, it inspires compassion for Moore, his men and their foes. And in that, there is merit."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,70,Some scenes achieve dramatic greatness and emotions that reach to the heart's core. Almost as many have the tinny ring of a badly counterfeited coin.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"We Were Soldiers feels strangely irrelevant -- a well-acted, well-crafted and inconsequential visit to woefully familiar territory."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Leaves all the real risks to the young warriors at Ia Drang and collects easy dividends on their bravery. In the end, it honors them by paying tribute to itself."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Fitfully effective as a battle movie, and Mel Gibson does his rugged best to take center stage without seeming to. But the movie is self-righteous in a way that's frequently unseemly."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,63,"Though the questionable motives and bad planning of offscreen characters who far outrank Gibson make it difficult to take at face value one soldier's last words -- ""I'm glad I could die for my country"" -- some viewers will, which may be as the filmmakers intended."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,The movie never generates the authority it needs to be all that it can be.
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,"Ultimately, though, We Were Soldiers fails to bring as much to the table as it at first seems it might."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,60,"Who these brave men were and why they fought disappears under the usual clichés, while the astounding acts of courage that occurred at Ia Drang are lost to the dust and din."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,"It was a hellish encounter, as well as a portent of the 10 years to come, and as such deserves far better than Mel Gibson's glower and writer-director Randall Wallace's guns-and-Moses platitudes."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,"It's a shame that the book ""We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young"" fell into the hands of writer-director Randall Wallace (""Braveheart""), a filmmaker who wouldn't recognize subtlety and understatement if they were to attack him in the street."
We Were Soldiers,7.2,78122718,50,Rarely have Gibson's tears seemed more fictional than in this supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,75,"At heart, this is an old-fashioned monster flick decked out with Hollywood's full battery of high-tech visual effects. It's as goofy as it is gory -- stay away if you don't like in-your-face mayhem."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,75,"It's Shakespearean in its political machinations and closer to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Starship Troopers"" than to ""Dracula"" or ""The Howling."""
Underworld,7.0,51970690,75,"However much Underworld recycles elements from other films, it carries us into a well-constructed, convincingly scary world worth visiting."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,75,"The filmmakers' decision to go with prosthetic enhancements rather than CGI gives the snouts, fangs and snapping jaws a refreshingly tactile look."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,67,It is the perfectly cast Beckinsale who lifts Underworld out and away from the films many moments of silly gravitas and steers it into a truly interesting take on the whole vampires 'n' werewolves genre.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,63,"Riddled with ammunition for what Alfred Hitchcock called the ""Plausibles""--those poor-sport moviegoers who insist on pointing out a movie's inconsistencies instead of simply enjoying the ride"
Underworld,7.0,51970690,63,"An example of a vampire movie for the new century -- stylish, gothic, gory, and loud."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,63,"As murky and derivative-looking as the film is, it moves with an authority that pummels you into submission."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,63,"Has one other thing in common with ""The Matrix Reloaded"" -- too much story, too many angles."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,60,"Visually it's wild fun, since fledgling feature director Len Wiseman started off in production design, and creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos's diverse credits span from ""Godzilla"" to ""Stuart Little."" Yet with Underworld's guilty pleasures come copious clinkers, from its nuts-and-bolts narrative foundation to Wiseman's inability to direct actors beyond cartoonish interaction."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,60,"The funny thing about all this is that a half-hour into Underworld I couldn't wait for it to be over. When it really was over, I couldn't wait for the next installment. Go figure."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,Takes itself so seriously that it never has fun with its shopworn genre elements.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,"Alas, as is often the case with lower-end genre movies, the story cooked up by Wiseman and his friends, actor Kevin Grevioux and the film's screenwriter, Danny McBride, is decidedly less important than the look of the film and its influences."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,"It's so impossible to care about the characters in the movie that I didn't care if the vampires or werewolves won. I might not have cared in a better movie, either, but I might have been willing to pretend."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,"Though it sometimes feels as if it's four hours long, Underworld has going for it an intriguing fantasy premise, an eventful plot and a look that is diverting, if finally a bit monotonous."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,"A loud and relentlessly overstated B-movie, and yet not entirely stupid."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,"All of this is accomplished with buckets of blood, but almost no sense of flesh: It's hard to recall a more sexless vampire flick."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,A slick disappointment -- though there's much unintentional humor to be enjoyed.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,50,"By the end, I was starting to ponder questions like, If a vampire mates with a lycan-vamp hybrid, which parent will have to convert?"
Underworld,7.0,51970690,40,"Beautiful in its dark, contrasting blues and blacks, Underworld is nonetheless a remarkably humorless movie, and not even the adroitly hammy Bill Nighy, as the vampire king, can leaven the overwrought seriousness of it all."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,40,Beckinsale delivers even if Underworld doesn't quite manage to follow through on its initial promise.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,40,"Achieves only loudness, aggressive confusion and one of the silliest head-splittings in film history."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,40,"So clotted with back story that the Romeo and Juliet-style romance between a warrior vampire and a reluctant werewolf never has a chance to breath, Len Wiseman's revisionist horror tale is all look and no bite."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,40,"This is the silliest horror movie I've seen in years, though some of the special effects are pretty good."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,38,"A hollow, relentless mess."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,30,Plays less like a novel re-imagining of a classic if campy narrative than a drearily self-conscious exercise in Know Your Film References.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,30,There's too much pretension in this film. Lots of intense stares into the camera. Lots of uncomfortably hip clothes. Lots of pompous names for themselves.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,30,125 minutes is a long time to stare at a movie that's basically in bleached blue-and-white with occasional splotches of brick red. The palette reinforces the monotony of the storyline.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,30,"Not since ""Battlefield Earth"" pitted overacting, nine-foot-tall Psychlos against puny man-animals has there been an interspecies match-up this perversely uninteresting."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,25,"Neither side is worth rooting for in this ridiculous blood feud, which features some of the year's most laughable dialogue."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,25,"Could use script transfusion, or at least a few quarts of levity."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,25,"""Your incompetence is most taxing,"" says the chief vampire (Bill Nighy). A line that pretty much nails this rusty Blade."
Underworld,7.0,51970690,20,Speedman's such a nonentity here I worried that the theater air-conditioning would blow him off the screen.
Underworld,7.0,51970690,20,It needs a wooden stake AND a silver bullet through its script.
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,80,A modernised Bond is dragged kicking and screaming into the 70s.
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,70,"There is a marvelous escape from an alligator farm (deadly reptiles are rather a motif in this movie), a superb collection of grotesque ways of killing, and a fine sense of pace and rhythm."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,70,"Live and Let Die isn't the best of the series by far, but it's not the worst either. The fun doesn't last due to the interference of the flimsy plot, centered around one of the least threatening Bond villains ever."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,63,"It has all the necessary girls, gimmicks, subterranean control rooms, uniformed goons and magic wristwatches it can hold, but it doesn't have the wit and it doesn't have the style of the best Bond movies."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,60,"The most significant Bond ingredient missing from Live and Let Die is Q, whose gadgets still play a central role. The film also offers a few key additions, including an illuminating glimpse of Bond’s home."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,60,"Two hours long and anti-climactic, but Bond fans won't be disappointed."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,50,"Watching Live and Let Die isn't a complete waste of time, but there's no overriding reason why anyone should go out of their way to see it unless they're a die-hard Bond fan or are curious about Roger Moore's first turn in the role."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,50,"This eighth film in the Bond series marks the first appearance of Roger Moore as the superspy. Less macho than Sean Connery's Bond, Moore's fastidiously dressed 007 survives by his wits and injects more humor into the proceedings."
Live and Let Die,6.8,35377836,40,"Guy Hamilton's direction lacks enthusiasm and pace, while even the art direction—long the Bond films' real secret weapon—seems to have fallen to a shrunken budget. Not much fun."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,75,"The Rise Of Cobra holds to a thrill-ride sensibility that’s unchallenging and more than a little goofy, but exciting and consistently well-managed."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,70,"While thesping is not the main game here, having a cast of bright young things certainly helps, and Quaid gets in a few nice John Wayne-like moments as the no-nonsense boss."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,70,"The loudest, flashiest, silliest and longest blockbuster in a summer full of long, silly, flashy, loud blockbusters (long and silly ""Transformers,"" flashy and loud ""Wolverine"")."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"A brazen, earsplitting, eye-popping, oddly satisfying action extravaganza, though it veers wildly off-target in its second hour."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"A loud but proficient slab of explode-o-rama summer blockbuster nonsense, perfectly entertaining if you like that sort of thing, extremely skippable if you don't."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,63,"This movie’s sole purpose is to make teenage boys high-five each other, and it’s faithfulness to that concept makes the cartoon carnage almost endearing."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,60,"The action is mostly brisk and bracing and the battleground, particularly Cobra's headquarters -- a vast network of tunnels under the polar ice cap -- are wonderfully imagined, as are the futuristic machines at the Joes' disposal. Basically, the Joes are not bad, it's just that they could have been much better with a little less conversation, a little more action."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"It's hard to deny that the first two-thirds of G.I. Joe is an enjoyable film, especially when graded on the curve of lowered expectations. Compared to other big-budget movies out this summer, it's pretty mediocre."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"G.I. Joe may not be beefier, but it’s cheesier and less aggravating than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,""  the summer ’09 headbanger it most resembles."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"Unlike it's ""Transformers"" cousin, the story is appealingly straightforward, and the movie is chock-a-block with breathless action sequences."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,"Chock full of high-tech action, with a lot of chasing and shooting and explosions."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,50,The plot feels both familiar and far-fetched.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,40,"Bond without the style and Team America without the bellylaughs. The moronic script and nonsensical plot are good for a snicker, though."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,38,"Certainly better than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" How so? Admittedly, it doesn't have as much cleavage. But the high-tech hardware is more fun to look at than the transforming robots, the plot is as preposterous, and although the noise is just as loud, it's more the deep bass rumbles of explosions than the ear-piercing bang of steel robots pounding on each other."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,38,More toy commercial than movie.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"The only collateral damage is in the audience, where, as you sit through the movie, you can feel your IQ drop minute by minute."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"After nearly two hours of nonstop mayhem, the film ends on a surprisingly muted note, though pains have been taken to make sure that the hoped-for sequel has been carefully set up."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show, Sommers hits his groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence that, in turn, leads to an underwater finale that’s absurdly overproduced, momentarily diverting, and then instantly forgettable."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,30,"Loud, shiny, and critic-proof, this franchise launcher is basically Transformers minus the humanity. Dennis Quaid provides some ballast as grizzled patriarch to the troop of sexy young lock-and-loaders."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,25,"Don't go expecting an escapist night at the movies; go expecting to be cudgeled into numb, drooling submission."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,20,"G.I. Joe was not screened for critics, but that’s not because of its mindless action and nonsensical plot. It’s because G.I. Joe is the kind of movie that bludgeons the viewer into submission with its loud and constant barrage of sound and fury."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,12,"Formerly a real American hero, G.I. Joe is no longer a hero (it's a group) or American. (It's a multinational team of military superstars, though the way it does business, you'd feel safer with the Croatian navy on your side.)"
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,12,"I don't know what to say about the acting, writing and directing in G.I. Joe because I couldn't find any."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,10,"There's a way to do this kind of thing (Just witness Hasbro's other toy-turned-dumb movie franchise, ""Transformers""). G.I. Joe, though, hasn't got a kung fu-grip on what it is."
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,5.8,152267519,10,"This pricey, juiceless pulp could never have been killed by critics, simply because it was already dead."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,40,"Director Russell Mulcahy can’t seem to decide from one scene to the next whether he’s making a sci-fi, thriller, horror, music video or romance – end result is a mishmash."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,38,"About halfway through the violent, fantasy adventure Highlander, one character talks about how it was the custom during ancient times to throw babies into a pit of hungry dogs. Well, there were more than a few times during this hyperviolent film in which I felt as if I were a baby being thrown to a dog of a movie."
Highlander,7.2,5900000,38,"Since none of the characters makes sense even on the movie's own terms, Highlander keeps on exploding for almost two hours, with nothing at stake."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,100,"It is the Road Warrior (as it was subtitled for the American release) that remains the definitive Max movie, hard as nails, hell for leather, it lands like a punch to the jaw. Don't drive angry? Yeah, right."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,100,"Part post-apocalyptic Western, part midnight motorcycle flick and part Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is, when you add it all up, a nutty, B-movie masterpiece."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,Miller's choreography of his innumerable vehicles is so extraordinary that it makes Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark look like a kid fooling with Dinky Toys.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,Miller suggests violence; he does not exploit it. He throws the viewer off-balance by mixing the ricochet rhythms of his chase scenes with tableaux of Walpurgisnacht grandeur.
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,90,"Director Miller keeps the pic moving with cyclonic force, photography by Dean Semler is first class, editing is supertight, and Brian May’s music is stirring."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,88,"The experience is frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating. This is very skillful filmmaking, and Mad Max 2 is a movie like no other."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"It's a highly stylized, roaringly dynamic action film that shuns plot and characterization in favor of a crazy iconographical melange—it's like the work of a western punk trucker de Sade...The climactic chase, with its deft variation of tempo and point of view, is a minor masterpiece."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"Gibson is surprisingly uncharismatic, but Miller makes up for it with whizz bang action."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"In its stripped-down, cannily cinematic way, it's one of the most imaginative Australian films yet released in this country. It has no pretensions to do anything except entertain in the primitive, occasionally jolting fashion of the first nickelodeon movies, whose audiences flinched as streetcars lumbered silently toward the camera."
Mad Max 2,7.6,12465371,80,"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is a straightforward action/adventure film, filled to the brim with over-the-top chases and stunts."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,100,"Despite a final, tacked-on helicopter denouement, it remains a gripping, relentless, supercharged slab of fun that knows no bounds - New York is its playground and the sky's the limit."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"Die Hard With a Vengeance is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"It's a tense, terrifically funny action dazzler with a wow level in special effects that will be hard to top."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"It should come as no surprise that Jonathan Hensleigh's script was not originally written as a ""Die Hard"" film. The blend of ""Die Hard"" and ""With a Vengeance"" is sometimes smooth but never complete. It's as if ""Die Hard"" were wearing a rented tux."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,75,"Director John McTiernan outdoes the previous ""Die Hards"" (McTiernan directed the first, Renny Harlin the second) with machinery, stunts, noise, bullets and guts. Hand-held camerawork tweaks the audience's sense of anxiety further, and for the most part it works well."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,70,"Cutting to the chase: In terms of summer movie thrills, director John McTiernan's return to the ""Die Hard"" genre (he made the first one) is a triumph."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,63,"All the explosions and fights are filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right. But that's where it stops. The pacing is erratic and the level of tension ebbs and flows."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,63,"The third Die Hard film is easily the most spectacular, featuring an exploding subway train and a manic car chase through the congested streets of New York that rivals ""The French Connection."""
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,"Director John McTiernan, who redefined the action genre in the original ""Die Hard,"" does devise some smashing explosions, crashes and so on, but nothing really new."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,"The movie turns two hours of bombings, subway crashes, car chases and helicopter pursuits into the ultimate roller-coaster ride."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,"McTiernan supplies one climax after another, but when the whole intense, meaningless experience is over you may have trouble putting a name or a face to the movie that just had its way with you."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,60,So little wit is expended on the dialogue and so much on the imagination of disaster that you may as well sit back and enjoy the jolting ride.
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,58,"In Die Hard With a Vengeance, McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse (there's a terrific bit with Willis and five thugs in an elevator), yet they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,"En route, the plot gimmick degenerates from clever to dumb, then gets forgotten entirely, and the last act simply poops out - the climax is a Bigger Bang that plays like the saddest of whimpers."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,"An overinflated mishmash that compels the audience to sift through a lot of rubble for the few requisite thrills, this second ""Die Hard"" sequel leaves a lot of creative wreckage in its wake."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,"McTiernan is an old hand at actioners and, like the pro he is, keeps the film rushing along from fiery stunt to stunt."
Die Hard: With a Vengeance,7.6,100012499,50,But Die Hard WAV lacks the freshness of its two predecessors: we've had it with gassy police psychiatrists and supersmart terrorists.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,80,"The heists are bigger, the illusions are flashier, and the pace is quicker. Even the cast is livelier and more fun. Perhaps best of all, the movie captures the first film’s twisty ability to twirl an audience around, so you’re never entirely sure what’s happened until everything is explained."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,80,"Now You See Me 2 is more like a giddy piece of cheese from the ’80s, a chance to spend two more hours with characters we like, doing variations on the things that made us like them in the first place. The revisit, in this case, is well-earned."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,80,"Director Jon M. Chu has a lighter touch than “Now You See Me” director Louis Leterrier. The latter’s “Transporter” pedigree made sure there was plenty of rugged action, but Chu’s résumé boasts “Jem and the Holograms,” “G.I. Joe: Retaliation,” and more than one film in the “Step Up” franchise. The man knows his cartoons, and that’s a good thing."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,75,"Working from a screenplay by Ed Solomon, director Jon M. Chu is more craftsman than poet, but the charismatic ensemble cast engages in the trickery with style."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,75,Now You See Me 2 gets giddy on its own unreality. That sense of freewheeling excess extends from the chip heist — set in a metal-free clean room — to the nonstop contrivances and coincidences to the cast.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,75,"Jon M. Chu (several Step Up movies) has taken over directing duties from Louis Leterrier, and he has a lighter, goofier touch. He seems to get that the silliness is baked in."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"In real life, of course, nobody can be hypnotized against their will. To be mesmerized is to willingly succumb. Just keep that in mind when you head off to see something like Now You See Me 2."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"It's the magic of movies, not a movie that comes close to achieving real magic."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"“2” is as flashy and splashy as the original. Both also register right up there on the implausibility scale — that’s like the Richter scale, only with head scratching — but “2” has a lighter touch and more interesting settings. Macau and London, here we come."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,63,"The film is, at times, almost sinfully fun, assuming you have a taste for self-indulgently logic-free hedonism."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,60,"Here's a movie that is far from perfect, far from seamless and far from unassailable. But it manages to be a fun diversion anyway -- and one that will likely leave audiences hungry for more."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"This time around, however, the magic has fizzled. Based solely on merit, Now You See Me 2 is a sequel that should never have been made."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"There's not much awe showcased here. The film is mainly horseplay, wasted motion, and talk, talk, talk, with a few good action scenes."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Try to remember this movie, a few days after seeing it, and you’ll find that — like magic — it’s disappeared."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"There are some marginal but still noticeable stylistic improvements in the sequel. John M. Chu (a veteran of music videos and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never) brings a peppy energy that Louis Leterrier’s first film lacked, especially when showing off the flashy spectacle of the Horsemen’s almost-superheroic magic abilities."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on whether you can suspend your disbelief — and confusion — and let the magic of misdirection wash over you.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Everything is supersized and preposterous, but Mr. Chu, with two films in the “Step Up” franchise under his belt, is undaunted by crowds and confusion."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Thaddeus Bradley, narrating in tedious metaphors about how “there’s always more than what’s on the surface.” That’s one claim this shallow sequel simply can’t back up."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Now You See Me 2 is more fun than ""Now You See Me,"" which says something, I guess. It fits snugly in the long list of easygoing nothings, the narrative equivalent of a Fruit Roll-Up, designed to be forgotten in as many minutes as they took to watch."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"If you fell for the 2013 original — and surprisingly, many did — then Now You See Me 2 has got your number. For the rest of us, however, this longer, louder sequel adds up to what one character calls ""a sack of nada."""
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Doubling down on the giddily ridiculous tone of its predecessor, Now You See Me 2 is diverting, but the film’s rampant, cheeky cleverness — its ‘can you guess what’s going on?” coyness — ultimately proves tiresome."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,50,"Compared with the first film, this one embraces the premise’s essential preposterousness, although not necessarily to winning effect."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,40,"Constructed to fool the viewer with layer upon layer of lame cheats and moth-eaten devices, the film has nothing on its mind but sinking you gently into an in-flight stupor."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,40,"It’s an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and, yes, magic of the original. You’ll like it, not a lot."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,40,"Now You See Me 2 is an essential example of how inessential movie sequels have become. It ignores what was good about the first film, abandons its defining characteristics, and tells a story nobody asked for."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,38,"That score — insistent, sexy, jazzy and loud — almost puts it over, letting us skim over the ways the laws of logic and physics are violated, the lack of charisma of these “charismatic” magicians, the works. Until the ending, where it all feels like a cheap cheat and a waste of two hours and nine minutes of your life."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,38,Sitting through the smug and convoluted and ridiculous Now You See Me 2 is like being subjected to a dunk tank again and again — and then being handed a wet towel when it’s finally over.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,38,The sheer amount of people and incident indifferently presented throughout this film suggests only an obligation to quota-filling.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,25,"Now You See Me 2 is a vapid, heartless film that wastes the time of its cast and audience alike."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,25,"For their next act, the illusionist con artists from Now You See Me will make every ounce of goodwill that movie earned disappear."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,20,Excruciatingly incoherent.
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,20,"The deal-breaking problem with these films – among so, so many problems – is this: They don’t f--king ground the magic in any sort of reality, but rely on CGI for their showstoppers."
Now You See Me 2,6.5,65075540,16,"We used to watch movies and wonder “How did they do that?” The problem with Now You See Me 2 isn’t that we already know the answer, it’s that we’re not even inspired to ask the question."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,78,"Director Howard, his actors, and indeed the entire salty sweep of the film are all aided tremendously by visual-effects supervisor Jody Johnson and his team’s spectacular combination of live action and flawless, awe-inspiring CGI creations, chief among them the great, white whale."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,75,"In the Heart of the Sea really gives Hemsworth a chance to shine. He’s not just the hammer-slinging Thor: The Aussie continues to make the most of his dramatic work — as in Howard’s 2013 Formula 1 film ""Rush"" — and showcases a considerable amount of gravitas."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,75,"The biggest problem with In the Heart of the Sea is its episodic nature. Especially during the post-sinking saga, things don’t flow smoothly."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,75,"Even though In The Heart Of The Sea’s framing device often feels like it was written by someone who’d never read a word of Melville, its visual style makes for a bold approximation of his allusive prose."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,70,"The picture is sometimes wayward and unwieldy, its dialogue creaky and awkward, like an amateur’s attempt at scrimshaw.... But in a movie climate rife with superhero reboots and rehashings of childhood favorites, it’s a small marvel that In the Heart of the Sea exists at all."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,67,In the Heart of the Sea doesn't trust itself enough to be great.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,67,"Howard’s film, for all of its storytelling skill, technical polish, and rousing high-seas sequences, never quite casts the spell it should. It’s too polite to give us a real feeling of life or death. Its sense of danger is watered down."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,"The whale special effects, computer-generated of course, are genuinely spectacular."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,"Only landlubbers would resist the rousing action of man versus leviathan. Sure it's old-school. So what. Howard puts heart, soul and every computerized whale trick in the book into crafting a seafaring adventure to rock your boat."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,An oddly uninvolving adventure story.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,63,"Howard’s In the Heart of the Sea merely unravels the yarn that inspired the great book, a good-looking film that never sinks, but never really soars either."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Despite the best efforts of the filmmakers, In the Heart of the Sea is a few knots away from being the transformative cinema experience intended."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,The images are impressive. But the characters and their development leave something to be desired.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"The dramatic scenes are a touch overcooked, and there are moments when it feels like a particularly high-end school play, with everyone shouting “Avast!” and “Ahoy!” like they really mean it. The action, though, is consistently impressive: When man and beast go toe-to-tail, your timbers will be truly well shivered."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Howard is great at capturing the timbre of the ship, the creaks and snaps and the whir of the hemp lines, and the sonar clicks of the whales strategizing below. All his sound and fury has a befuddling purpose. His emotional climax is about, well, disaster insurance."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Fluid, shifting and tense, the action here easily outstrips the film’s basic set-up (man tests himself against nature, is humbled), which can feel like unconvincing filler between surges of effects work."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,There’s so much incident crammed into this tale of misfortune that there’s never quite enough time to truly tangle with the sheets and sails of its meaning.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Given the weighty themes of Moby Dick, In The Heart Of The Sea doesn't have a lot going on behind the outward action. The composite parts are in fine working order; it's the sum that's slightly lacking."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,60,"Director Ron Howard does a solid job of getting the smell of salt off the page and into the picture. The first half works quite well simply as a procedural, but when the action comes we run into trouble. The well-earned seriousness is washed away as we’re broadsided by B-movie tropes."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,58,"If the movie accomplishes nothing else, though, I hope it inspires the curious to actually sit down and finally read “Moby-Dick.” It’s an extraordinary yarn. Really."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"The conversion to 3-D has left the movie looking grim and dim. Almost every scene, whether indoors by candlelight or upon the open ocean, seems awkwardly dark; competent 3-D effects don’t compensate for this distraction. Equally drab are the performances, except for Gleeson and Whishaw."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,At the heart of the problem with this period piece is an absence of a riveting scene or a memorable slice of dialogue.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"Overall, it is false, both narratively and visually, in a way that just doesn't sit right with me, and it feels like a lesser effort from Howard, an itch he scratched but that hold little interest for anyone else."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"If you want a Ron Howard movie about a man obsessed with a creature from the deep, In the Heart of the Sea, sadly, is not the place to start. Try “Splash.”"
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"And this is ultimately what damages In the Heart of the Sea more than anything else: it is so very many different things, but they all feel detached from each other, almost like a bunch of self-contained mini-movies stitched end-to-end, with the framing device serving as needle and thread."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,The whale is wondrous but the drama not so much in In the Heart of the Sea.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"As the movie lurches along by fits and starts, toggling between the little Nantucket room and the great watery world, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have no idea how to reconcile not just two parallel stories but also the past and our contemporary age."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"It’s a tentative, half-realized tale that ultimately suffers from a significant identity crisis."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"With In the Heart of the Sea, director Ron Howard has given us a painstakingly crafted bore, a lovingly rendered snooze, and a very expensive means by which audiences can experience restless leg syndrome before being carted off to the land of happy slumber."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"I wish Howard's film had more of a distinct personality and drive behind it; Howard's made some supremely enjoyable films, in various keys, but this waterlogged, effects-crazed picture isn't one of them."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"You come away from the movie lamenting the missed opportunity and wondering what a stronger, bolder filmmaker would have done with this material."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"There are aspects afloat reminiscent of the great 1946 sea epic ""Two Years Before the Mast"", but  Chris Hemsworth is no Alan Ladd. He is to the majesty of a ship at sea what a clamshell is to the bottom of a canoe."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"Visual daring is nice, but it means little in the end when the ultimately safe and harmless story never rocks the boat."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,50,"A sort of maritime Donner Party, In the Heart of the Sea is a rugged but underwhelming true-life drama of a cursed 19th century whaling voyage."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,45,"Lovers of spectacle for spectacle’s sake will come away from the film with many discrete sequences to admire, but there’s not enough of a human element to bridge them together. In terms of its lasting power, In the Heart of the Sea roars in like a great tide, but then just as quickly dissipates."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,42,"Unfortunately, the reverence Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt seem to feel for the material ultimately dooms it to—if you’ll pardon the seafaring reference—float along in the doldrums, doomed to a driftless existence enlivened only by the occasional giant whale."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,42,"The movie has all the propulsion of a trolling motor, traversing long-charted dramatic waters."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"For all the special effects and half-starved A-listers, this is a sodden beast. Perhaps there’s a reason that Melville only told half the story."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"Even when the film does try to rouse emotion, it feels like a last minute attempt to make up for lack of character development."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"In the Heart of the Sea isn’t a bad film, necessarily. It has some genuinely effective passages in its first half, and Howard is nothing if not a dutiful, check-the-boxes kind of director. But a story like this – one of horror and madness, which helped give birth to an ornate masterpiece of obsession – needs to go a little crazy. And this director doesn’t do crazy."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"Howard shows his viewers what happened to these sailors, but he rarely offers any sense of who they were, or what it felt like to face their situation."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"This movie has Chris Hemsworth, in between ""Avengers"" movies, and a lot of computer-generated sea life. It uses a lot of fancy lures, but it never hooks you."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,40,"In the Heart of the Sea feels stiff and unconvincing, weirdly devoid of texture, and populated by ciphers who speak primarily in the leaden language of exposition."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,38,Presenting a “true” adventure about a giant whale that supposedly inspired “Moby-Dick” raises tsunami-high expectations about In the Heart of the Sea that are crushed as thoroughly as if star Chris Hemsworth had brought down his “Thor” hammer on the entire enterprise.
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,38,"In the Heart of the Sea plays as if the joke was real and everyone on the production had caved in. The result, as a movie, is a joke."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,25,"The narrative is helplessly adrift, a yarn that extols vague grit and determination with no discernible through line."
In the Heart of the Sea,6.9,25020758,0,"The script, by Charles Leavitt, is dead in the water, and the drama is too, despite billowing sails and pods of whales. Instead of “Jaws” it’s a turgid “Tails.”"
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,75,"Theron proves the master of operatic hissy fits, Blunt lets the pain show beneath the glacial cool, Chastain brings her usual Juilliard-schooled commitment to the occasion, and Hemsworth is Hemsworthian, if oft-times incomprehensible, delivering his lines in a gorse-y whorl of vowels and consonants."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,67,"It’s all pretty silly, but it compensates for a lack of emotional weight with star power."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,60,"It’s a welcome surprise: sharper and funnier than its doom-laden predecessor, with a fantasy setting immersive enough to distract from the narrative’s various chips and cracks."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,60,"With a wraparound narrative that never really strikes a balance between past and present, all that axe-flinging, ice-casting action makes a modest impact."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,"Winter's War isn't tedious. Amiably bad movies seldom are. Theron and Blunt look fabulous doing silly, screechy things in Colleen Atwood's costumes. Chastain makes Sara a formidable match in battle and bed with Eric, who becomes less important as these wonder women converge."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,"In spite of all of its myriad shortfalls, this film succeeds as well as it does because it does not shy away from this truth, and because it gives us a romances that feel so true between people we would like to see succeed."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,58,It’s the movie equivalent of a cake that’s all frosting.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,55,"If all else fails, at least it’s a movie smart enough to know that, frankly, you can’t beat Charlize Theron, covered in gold, shooting lethal spiky tentacles out of her midriff."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"By cramming far too much material into 114 minutes, The Huntsman: Winter’s War feels rushed and incomplete. It doesn’t help that the screenplay is at times awful, forcing accomplished actors to recite excruciatingly bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"Unlike the smarter ""Maleficent,"" a revisionist Sleeping Beauty created by the same producers, what The Huntsman series lacks is any intriguing psychology."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"Every time Charlize Theron is on screen, the movie gets crazy campy, and therefore at least somewhat interesting."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,The mishmash of filmmaking makes it clear this was a movie made by committee — and clearly that committee was composed of folks who were not all on the same page when it came to spinning what could have been a much more engaging piece of fantasy storytelling.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"While the funny, action-packed sequences are the best parts, they are indicative of the film’s main problems: an inability to focus and an overly complicated plot."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,Pretty uninspired material for a dream-teaming of actresses who currently rate among the edgiest of them all.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"From scene to scene, there are some beautiful images in the fantasy world where this is set, but frustratingly, it never adds up to something that comes to life. This feels like terrific production design and costuming in search of a story worth telling."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"If judged by fluid effects work, Atwood’s stunning costumes, and the fun of watching Theron and Blunt reach new heights of arch camp, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is a triumph. By any other measure, though, it’s a far more qualified prospect"
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,50,"It’s passably entertaining, and like the last one breathtakingly crafted, especially Colleen Atwood’s microscopically detailed costumes."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,42,"There’s very little in The Huntsman: Winter's War itself that is actively bad. Compared to some of its blockbuster rivals, it’s reasonably watchable, never offensive, and mostly coherent."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,It’s all too much without ever turning into much at all.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"This unintentionally fractured ends up one big mess. It's a pretty mess, mind you -- which is fitting in a way, given the sordid affair that birthed it -- but a mess all the same."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"The actors are all game, but the job’s beneath them – Hemsworth, a pro, and a real champ at faking enthusiasm for this dud; Theron, still doing camp but this time with no tempering complexity or empathy; Blunt, stuck playing a frost-bitten Mommie Dearest."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"The film borrows plenty, but it brings nothing new."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,There’s almost nothing in this movie that hasn’t been seen elsewhere before. And done a whole lot better.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"Visual inventiveness and spectacular casting can’t quite salvage a muddled fantasy epic that, if it were a magic mirror, would be held together with gaffer tape."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"In many ways this is an adult Frozen with Gothic sensibilities by way of The Lord Of The Rings, making for a derivative pastiche of the past two decades' cinematic fantasy offerings."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,40,"All told, ‘Winter’s War’ is not the fairest sequel, but it’s not so terrible that it deserves to be taken out to the forest and finished off."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,The Huntsman is a flabby mess — yet another sequel with no reason to exist.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"It’s a dunderheaded follow-up, for sure, but it’s at least buoyed by Chris Hemsworth’s charisma and the few times where Winter’s War embraces complete camp."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"If you liked “Frozen” but wish it had been angrier, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is for you."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,38,"The overriding despair of Winter's War's imagery calls into question who, exactly, the film is for."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,33,"The film's narrative is both plodding and predictable, and after the third or fourth battle sequence that leans so heavily on loud, thudding noises and swirling leather topcoats that it's impossible to see who is actually hitting who (and, moreover, why), audiences may be in danger of remembering just which ""reimagined"" fairy tale they're watching on screen."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"There’s only one reason to see The Huntsman: Winter’s War: Gowns! Insane, off-the-hook gowns."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"A convoluted narrative yields not a single, palpable moment of drama."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,The film absolutely delivers on the scenery-chewing front. And yet the movie is still hollow and joyless.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,30,"The sheer abundance of on-screen ornamentation isn’t quite enough to make The Huntsman: Winter’s War a beautiful film.... Still, it’s one that has been exhaustively designed by many hands — which only further shows up its inelegant patchwork in the writing department."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,This incoherent screenplay seems to have been written by a roomful of the gorilla-like trolls who show up in the movie at one point.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,A resoundingly unlovable movie that almost resists being watched.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,"Nothing can match seeing Theron and Blunt try to out-camp each other, providing the only glimmer of entertainment in a film dedicated to being ponderous. No one sings ""Let It Go,"" but my advice to audiences is to do just that before mistakenly buying a ticket."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,25,"The mirror effects are still striking, Theron, Blunt, Hemsworth and Chastain still fairy-tale beautiful. But The Huntsman: Winter’s War, is the very picture of a movie that should have never been made. It never, for one second, gives us a reason to think otherwise."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,20,It really is a nuclear war of dullness.
The Huntsman: Winter's War,6.1,48390190,10,"Its badness is not extreme, but exemplary: It’s everything wrong with Hollywood today stuffed into a little less than two hours."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,75,"Wirkola tears through Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters with such giddy abandon, it ends up being splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,58,"Unfortunately, Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola’s Hansel & Gretel is just another entry in Bland Fairy Tale Theater, a shapeless riff on those hapless German siblings with the worst parents ever."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,50,"The blend of fairy-tale sentiment and knowing irony worked exactly once, in ""The Princess Bride,"" and fails here. But there's enough visual ingenuity - eye candy, if you will - to make this Hansel & Gretel an intermittently tasty temptation."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,42,"The grim heroes don't have a nuance or more than a hint of emotion between them, and the same goes for the film around them."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,42,"An intermittently fun, but overexcited and predictable mish-mash."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,"Though it gives good splat and the scenery’s to die for, Hansel & Gretel gets just about everything wrong. Hammy, boring, chronically unfunny - there’ll be nightmares before bedtime."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,"Even if he's slumming, Renner gets it best: his dry delivery fully acknowledges the movie's ridiculousness. If you're planning on entering this fractured fairy tale, you'll want to follow his lead."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,The film is smart enough not to wear out its welcome. But that's the only sign of true intelligence in this juvenile caper.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,40,"While the film rarely provokes any strenuous eye-rolling, it also can't drum up even the slightest interest in the fate of its characters, let alone suspense."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,38,Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is more Gatling guns and grenades than The Brothers Grimm.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,37,A rarely funny spoof that's heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,30,"There isn't much swashbuckling chemistry between Mr. Renner and Ms. Arterton, and the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,30,"If the similarly situated ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" took itself too seriously, the problem with Hansel & Gretel is that it doesn't quite take itself seriously enough - which sounds insane, but it's not too much to ask that the movie go beyond its one and only joke. Instead, amid all the fake Sturm und Drang, all we hear is the movie giggling to itself."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"In an age of zombies, werewolves and oversexed vampires, teens won't be shaking in their Uggs over ugly women with bad teeth flying around on brooms, and with its graphic depictions of tortures, mutilations, gang rapes and myriad examples of child abuse, it's no longer a fairy tale suitable for children."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"The film can't be accused of taking itself seriously. Shot in 3-D, with lots of choppy action, a rudimentary plot, and plenty of CGI-shape-shifting, it comes in at a brisk, disposable 88 minutes."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"Not only is not even a single character more than one-dimensional, but every line falls flatter than a witch dispatched with a Gatling gun."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,25,"This genre stew throws in so many ingredients - including sundry body parts that are cut off and go flying, and heads that explode - that the result is a tasteless mash-up that's hard to stomach."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,20,"This movie is a case in point. It's a film which is so demeaningly bad, so utterly without merit, that there is a kind of purity in its awfulness. There is a Zen mastery in producing a film which nullifies the concept of pleasure."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,20,"No stranger to one-joke premises, writer-director Tommy Wirkola (of 2009's Nazi-zombie ""classic"" ""Dead Snow"") populates this frenzied horror-satire with tons of incoherently staged bloodletting and f-bomb–accentuated kiss-off lines. It's a grim fairy tale, all right."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,11,"In his English-language debut, Wirkola dabbles in everything but commits to nothing, making for an unmemorable brew best left untasted."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,10,"The Brothers Grimm may have come up with some cruel, weird material in their day, but they'd never condone actor abuse like this."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,10,"What galls is that for all the perspiration in jazzing up an old yarn, there's not a whiff of originality in how Wirkola engages with the perverse pleasures enshrined by the Grimm brothers, two of their era's shrewdest storytellers."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,0,"What to say about this lame-brained, limp dick attempt to update a classic Brothers Grimm tale into an f-bomb throwing vomit-inducing 3D franchise? I say, screw the damn thing and run the other way."
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,0,Tommy Wirkola's film suggests A Knight's Tale as penned by Seth MacFarlane.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6.1,55703475,0,An exceedingly dull and stillborn attempt to update the Brothers Grimm.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,70,"Familiarity and continuity are what the success of this series has always been about. We've been here before, and we like the neighborhood."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,67,"Has a delightfully nasty villain and pumped-up action, albeit along familiar lines."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,67,A little bit obsessed with replication.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,The venerable series is looking outmoded and outdated. Media saturation and age have taken their toll.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"If anyone tries to tell you how this one ends, blast 'em with a phaser. Set on stun, of course."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"Fails to match the philosophical and acting bounties of 1996's ''First Contact.'' Baird has seen to it that the Enterprise's being under fire still amounts to the crew rocking back and forth, gripping the railings as the ship's phasers are down to 4 percent."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"This is a better movie than the vacuous ""Insurrection,"" thanks largely to a sympathetic screenwriter, longtime ""Trek"" fanatic John Logan (""Gladiator""), and a crew (headed by Patrick Stewart's Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and Brent Spiner's android Data) determined to go out in glory."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"Unfortunately, the plot runs out of dilithium crystals, and drifts to a sluggish and predictable conclusion"
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"While Star Trek: Nemesis isn't nearly as good as the best Nicholas Meyer-written movies like ""The Undiscovered Country,"" it is far from the worst, thanks to the topical issues it raises, the performances of Stewart and Hardy, and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"Once again, perhaps the most impressive effect is Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard, using his Shakespearean training to make long mouthfuls of nonsense sound almost persuasive."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,63,"It combines elements of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Star Wars"" and James Bond flicks with generically satisfying results."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"Nemesis never feels true to itself, its energy never fully engaged. Even with Earth on the line in its climactic space battle, the film seems embarrassed that it couldn't have found a better way to work through its issues."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"Once it reaches the meat of the story, it seems to lose its confidence."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,Reasonably entertaining if utterly familiar entry in the long-running SF franchise.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"An amiably klutzy affair whose warm, fuzzy heart emits intermittent bleats from the sleeve of its gleaming spacesuit."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,The humor is not as hackneyed as in previous films.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,60,"Despite the intriguing set-up, there's something unambitious and scaled-back about Star Trek Nemesis, so that most of the time it feels like a slightly suped-up episode of the ""Next Generation"" TV series."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,Fails to engage.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"As spent screen series go, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"Conventional wisdom has it that the best Star Trek movies are the even-numbered ones. Nemesis may keep that streak alive, but barely."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"Star Trek is over for me. I've been looking at these stories for half a halftime, and, let's face it, they're out of gas."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"As Shinzon, a sickly boy-emperor grown from Picard's DNA by scheming Romulans, Tom Hardy channels some of the verve of rich-Corinthian-leather-clad Khan villain Ricardo Montalban, although his real model seems to be Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,50,"Even though it doesn't feel like an appropriate send-off, the lethargy of Star Trek: Nemesis is probably indication enough that the series should end here."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,40,"Nemesis, by comparison, is about as exciting as a Tribble on Vicodin."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,40,"Plays like a greatest-hits remix; like ""Die Another Day,"" it's bent on resurrecting a moribund franchise by recalling all the things you used to love about it till you grew into big-boy pants."
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,38,"There comes a time when the future looks old, and that's where ""Star Trek"" finds itself on the time-space continuum."

Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,30,Collapsed into the black hole of its own mythology.
Star Trek: Nemesis,6.4,43254409,30,An offering so endearingly lame it seems to have missed the past 10 years' worth of special-effects breakthroughs.
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,80,"Never managing to look more hi-tech or further on from 1987 than, well, Hi-tech trainers, this Arnie vehicle still runs it's bloody course without dropping many gears. A brainless, breathless thrill."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,70,"Has the manners and the gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film but is, at heart, an engagingly mean, cruel, nasty, funny send-up of television. It's not quite Network, but then it also doesn't take itself too seriously."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,63,"The one element in the movie that is not standard and that does have some energy is the TV show itself, with Dawson's performance as the egotistical, sleaze-bag host."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,60,"For the right audience, it'll be fun. It's for action movie fans with a taste for something off the beaten track -- but not too far. And for people who like to rail and spew against the vulgarity and stupidity of TV -- but keep watching it all anyway."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,50,"Once things get going, The Running Man just turns into a silly chase movie populated by baddies who look like B-level pro-wrestling villains."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,50,"With a wholly derivative concept, confused scripting, and incredibly sloppy direction, THE RUNNING MAN is a frustrating experience."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,40,"Format works only on a pure action level, with some exciting, but overly repetitious, roller-coaster style sequences of runners hurtling into the game through tunnels on futuristic sleds. Schwarzenegger sadistically dispatches the baddies, enunciating typical wisecrack remarks (many repeated from his previous films), but it’s all too easy, despite the casting of such powerful presences as Jim Brown and former wrestlers Jesse Ventura and Prof. Toru Tanaka."
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,40,The film doesn't look good; it's as if the flat lighting and boring set of the TV show had infected everything else. And Big Arnie's quilted outfit makes him look like a duvet.
The Running Man,6.7,38122105,40,"You want to know if The Running Man is a good-time macho show, right? Stay at home and watch professional wrestling. Or Miami Vice (same director -- Paul Michael Glaser). Sure there's blood spattering and bullets riddling and Big Boys Banging Biceps. But through the dry-ice haze, Running Man is surprisingly boring."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,75,Fast and funny and brings back some of the wonder to the series.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,70,"Definitely still beating a dead dinosaur here, but the film is leaner, more exciting and superior in every way to the last outing."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,67,Another of many recent Hollywood plotless wonders.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,What makes it worth sitting through is the chance it offers to catch up on the technical advances since the last installment.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,"Despite all its talk of genetic engineering and its deliberately stupid characters, the unintended message of Jurassic Park III is that when it comes to art and entertainment, you can't beat human DNA."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,"Anything, Steven, anything would be better than making us watch the same movie again."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,63,"Isn't terribly frightening or gory, and at times it's even atmospheric. It also has a sense of humor, and the digs at the prequels hit pay dirt."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,60,The sheer physical presence of these creatures is much more believable and convincing than what can be generously characterized as the film's plot.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,60,"At its best, Jurassic Park III is eerily similar to some of the more recent dinosaur-themed video games on the market."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,60,"Has no pretentions to be anything more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it's such a routine ride."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"While kids of all ages will want to see it, the movie is loud and occasionally brutal, and while the body count is relatively low, it's still pretty scary stuff."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"The whole enterprise sags and wheezes like the tired, we're-in-this-strictly-for-the-money sequel it really is."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"This is a monster movie -- 92 minutes, lots of action, lots of green legs stomping, get in, get out."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"The screenplay is so stale that even fans of the previous ""Jurassic"" installments might think this is one clone too many."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"Maybe if you're younger than 10 you'll be scared or thrilled by this film. Otherwise, be prepared for one of the most unexciting pictures this summer."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,50,"The story's tired, as are the main characters."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,42,"When a cell-phone gag is the most exciting or inventive thing in a big summer dinosaur movie, you have to wonder if the species might not be ready for extinction."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,"All it wants to do is scare a smile onto your face, and it often succeeds. After all, how can a movie that offers Michael Jeter as a mercenary not be fun?"
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,More of the same -- only less so.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,"With Joe Johnston directing instead of Spielberg, who executive-produces, and a scrum of screenwriters, none named Crichton, the franchise suffers some negligence."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,"Has to be the sorriest excuse for a reprise since ""Highlander — The Final Dimension."""
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,Even the special effects alone aren't worth the price of admission.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,40,Game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,38,"The ""Jurassic Park"" movie franchise does not evolve. Quite the opposite: It degenerates at great speed."
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,38,Drama is minimal and character nonexistent.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,30,A serious been-there-done-that number.
Jurassic Park III,5.9,181171875,25,"Stinks worse than dino dung. Sure, the creatures look good."
Blade,7.1,70087718,80,"Big as it is, Blade' is meticulous and subtle, not just in its camera technique but in the way it works its themes and creates a mood."
Blade,7.1,70087718,75,"Wesley Snipes understands the material from the inside out and makes an effective Blade because he knows that the key ingredient in any interesting superhero is not omnipotence, but vulnerability."
Blade,7.1,70087718,75,"Blade in no way resembles a good movie, but its combination of music-video bombast, goth-rock sensibility, high-tech industrial production design, cold-blooded glossy magazine visuals, high-fashion club culture, horror movies, blaxploitation movies, Hong Kong movies and comic-book nihilism make it diverting trash."
Blade,7.1,70087718,70,"Sure, the story is pretty standard, and the dialogue is laughable or worse. But creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence make watching this comic-book movie—Blade is a minor, almost-forgotten Marvel comic—entertaining."
Blade,7.1,70087718,70,"""Interview With the Vampire"" it's not, but marginally thrilling nonetheless, and besides, any film that features a house party in which the ceiling-mounted fire extinguishers expel freshets of crimson goo in place of H2O gets my vote."
Blade,7.1,70087718,67,"By the time the film is well into its second hour, we begin to wonder whether there's ever going to be a variation on the carnage and mayhem. As it turns out, there isn't."
Blade,7.1,70087718,63,Blade doesn't manage to work up a whole lot of suspense.
Blade,7.1,70087718,63,"Blade's stomach-turning special effects, bone-crunching martial arts and cynical humor will more than satisfy any action-film addict's need for a fix of eye-popping escapist adrenaline."
Blade,7.1,70087718,60,"At best, second-rate pulp, hampered by excessive length, a thematically meandering screenplay, and a general lack of excitement."
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,Director Stephen Norrington is more keen on finding new ways to explode the fiends... than developing a credible story. So the movie flits from one gore-laden assault to another with little suspense.
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,"For most of its two-hour running time it simply flings a barrage of horrors at the audience, enhanced with the most imaginative science-fiction atmospherics this side of ""Dark City,"" which incidentally was a far more original picture."
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,The noir atmosphere doesn't quite smother the dialogue's cheesy smell.
Blade,7.1,70087718,50,"Although the opening scene suggests a dark urban satire, Blade quickly turns into a cartoonish futuristic action-adventure yarn in which Blade is the only thing keeping humanity from being exterminated by vampires in a hematological holocaust."
Blade,7.1,70087718,40,"Though slick and diverting in some aspects, increasingly silly pic has trouble meshing disparate elements --- horror, superhero fantasy, straight-up action --- into a workable whole."
Blade,7.1,70087718,40,If only it wasn't such bloody nonsense.
Blade,7.1,70087718,38,"Adapted from the Marvel Comics series, this movie lacks the mournfulness that sustains a good horror strip; it's trashy, but too deafening and invasive to have the appeal of good pulp."
Blade,7.1,70087718,38,A vulgar attempt to revamp the undead genre by introducing computer-generated splatter and a casketful of themes from genetic tinkering to conspiracy theories.
Blade,7.1,70087718,30,"The few good lines go to Kristofferson and the ever-amusing Kier, but Snipes's considerable energy is buried under an affectless, Terminator-style demeanor."
Blade,7.1,70087718,30,"The action involves lots of second-rate martial-arts choreography (made even less thrilling by the video's pan-and-scan job), while the psychological conflicts are filled with unconvincing angst."
Blade,7.1,70087718,30,"Working from a script by David S. Goyer (""Dark City"") that lacks any sense of humor or character, Snipes seems unsure if he should vamp it up or play it straight, while Dorff just plain sucks."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,100,James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma restores the wounded heart of the Western and rescues it from the morass of pointless violence.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,100,"The new version is a glorious, thrilling throwback that never sacrifices its solid roots in the western genre despite a sharp modern update that actually improves on the original."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,100,"The finest American Westerns have a characteristic that 3:10 to Yuma shares. In a way that's almost mystical, they suggest a truth beyond the specifics of the tale."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,91,The rousing new Western 3:10 to Yuma has the sweep of an epic and the economy of a stopwatch.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,90,James Mangold directs it with such energy and passion that it's as if he didn't know it's all been done before.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,90,"Mangold has time to build sensational, studied characterizations, brilliant pacing (courtesy Mike McCuster, who also edited the director’s previous effort, the Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line”), and blistering action."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"The nerve-racking wait at the Contention hotel is no longer the film's centerpiece, but the deeper characterization gives Bale an opportunity to once again sink his teeth into a complex role, and offers a reminder as to why the notoriously difficult Crowe is sometimes worth the trouble."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"Unlike Glenn Ford, a soft-spoken studio star who was cast against type as Wade 50 years ago, Crowe is a perfect fit. Not because of his bad boy behavior offscreen, but because he can blend charm and menace better than anyone."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"Both actors are among the best, most intuitively creative we have, and whatever transpires offscreen in Crowe’s case, onscreen they only serve their characters. Neither man showboats here, and it’s a thrill to watch them work."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,88,"A riveting remake of a pretty terrific 1957 western about manhood, fatherhood and honor."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,83,"What Alfred Hitchcock once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns: The stronger the bad guy, the better the film. By that measure, 3:10 to Yuma is excellent."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,83,"Mangold delivers a taut modern take on a lesser classic, preserving the ""High Noon"" themes about doing the right thing against all odds, and injecting a more modern pacing and urgency without going overboard. His film isn't Leonard's classic, but it's a solid, genre-respecting Western in its own right."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,83,"A fine and sturdy picture, capable of standing alongside the many such films made when Westerns were one of our chief entertainments."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,A largely compelling ride on the strength of a powerful cast led by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,"In this movie, Fonda really is iconic. 3:10 to Yuma may be familiar, but, at its best, it has a rapt quality, even an aura of wonder."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,James Mangold's remake walks a fine line in retaining many of the original's qualities while smartly shaking things up a bit.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,"Period westerns are so unfashionable and costly that they usually require a top-drawer script to get off the ground -- and this one, adapted from an Elmore Leonard story and its 1957 movie version, travels with an arrow's clean arc."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,80,"Who says remakes are always inferior to the original film? And who says the western is dead? Especially when a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,78,"This film is an example of a Western that ought to appeal to a healthy-sized contemporary audience, and is also a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, which is a hallmark of the type of psychological Western."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"This is how a Western today tries to give us more bang for the buck. By working this hard to be a crowd-pleaser, though, it may please fewer crowds."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"The 30-minute finale, which includes a tense stand-off with Ben's gang, is masterfully executed. It's perfectly paced, suspenseful, and ends in a way that's both appropriate and satisfying."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"Maybe this redo didn’t need so many bells and whistles, but Mangold brings it home."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"Mangold has been smart or fortunate in casting, and personalities sustain interest even when the narrative flags."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"Captures a potent sense of the Old West with its multidimensional raw performances and captivating final shootout sequence. But with its emphasis on emotional truths, it transcends the confines of a cowboy movie."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"While the newer version's darker ending lends a more contemporary twist, overall 3:10 to Yuma is reverent to the original – a few more bullets and more spilled blood notwithstanding."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,An extremely well-acted and well-directed remake of a 1957 oater.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,75,"In the battle of the leading men, Crowe's character has a slight edge, and the actor really makes the most of it, showing us how boyishly mischievous charm and utter venality can exist without seeming contradiction in the same being. But Bale builds to a pretty impressive boil himself after laying back for about three quarters of the film."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"What this version offers is the chance to watch Russell Crowe and Christian Bale—two of the more charismatic, macho leading men around--duke it out psychologically, while another fine but less well-known intensity artist, Ben Foster, steals"
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"The movie's best performance belongs to Peter Fonda. Tough, terrific, and totally unrecognizable as a bounty hunter, this cantankerous old hippie is so leathery he deserves his own line of rawhide apparel."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"Under Mangold’s sure if uninspired hand, the new Yuma is reasonably exciting and terse, and, like its predecessor, built around a memorable villain of ambiguous villainy."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,More likely to be recalled as a moderately satisfying entertainment than remembered as a classic.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"Overall, the picture is accomplished, intelligent and, in places, a little dull. Mangold isn't an economical filmmaker, and parts of 3:10 to Yuma suffer from needless bloat. The new version doesn't use the same kind of blunt, visually arresting shorthand as Daves' original...And yet somehow, maybe just barely, Mangold -- succeeds on his own terms, largely because the actors he's working with here."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,70,"As Ben Wade, gang leader and murderer, he gives an ironic performance, but Crowe’s irony is more intense than other actors’ obsession. He turns the idea of having so few emotions--of being beyond caring--into a bloody joke. He upstages everyone with his laughing eyes."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,67,"The result bears so little resemblance to the original that you have to wonder what happened. It seems more a remake of ""How the West Was Won"" than 3:10 to Yuma."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,63,The acting is its chief strength. Russell Crowe brings a cocky charisma to Ben Wade.
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,50,"The strengths of the first ""3:10 To Yuma"" were enhanced by its proportionality -- an intimate story told in 92 minutes. The story is no bigger in the new version, which goes on for 117 minutes. And it's certainly not better."
3:10 to Yuma,7.7,53606916,50,The remake adds 24 minutes and subtracts most of the suspense.
The Crow,7.6,50693162,88,"The Crow imbues its comic brutalism with emotion and satire. Too raw and pulpy, it probably shouldn't be regarded as a memorial to Brandon Lee. But as an obsessive rock 'n' roll comic book movie shocker of loony intensity, it stands, or flies, by itself."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,88,"It is a stunning work of visual style - the best version of a comic book universe I've seen - and Brandon Lee clearly demonstrates in it that he might have become an action star, had he lived."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,88,"If he had to die so soon, this movie is the best and most appropriate sendoff Lee could have hoped for."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,80,"Style over content, sure, but what style."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,80,"A seamless, pulsating, dazzlingly visual revenge fantasy that stands as one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,75,"The Crow, the death-haunted, mega-violent, pulpy, vigorous final film of Brandon Lee, may not qualify as much of a monument to a lost life -- what film could? -- but it's a hell of a movie."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,75,"If the arrival of The Crow - a visually dazzling and hyperkinetic action movie - is an occasion to mourn the loss of Lee, it is also ample reason to celebrate the protean gifts of its director, Alex Proyas."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,75,The vision of director Alex Proyas lifts this film above its sad history.
The Crow,7.6,50693162,70,"It is a dark, lurid revenge fantasy and not the breakthrough, star-making movie some people have claimed. But it is a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,67,"Brandon Lee's swan song is a kinetic, pounding, adrenalized feast for the senses, if not the psyche. Bursting with startling images, eclectic staging, and gorgeous neo-gothic set design."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,60,"Lee has phenomenal presence, and his movements are so balletically powerful that his rampages seem like waking nightmares. Lee keeps you watching The Crow when you'd rather look away."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,60,The bottom line is that The Crow is a somewhat-better-than-average exploitation flick that has received an extra shot of hype from the untimely and dramatic demise of its star performer.
The Crow,7.6,50693162,58,"Lee's performance is by far the best thing about The Crow. Unfortunately, he's just good enough to make you wish that the movie had had a whisper of storytelling invention to go along with its showy visual design."
The Crow,7.6,50693162,50,"It succeeds in bringing O'Barr's comic-book vision to life, but there's little else going on behind the graphic razzle-dazzle and the moody, ominous soundtrack."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,Manages to capture the pure heart and spirit of this comic book Americana.
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Boasts a smart screenplay by Robert Benton and David and Leslie Newman, striking cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth (especially in the Smallville sequence), bright comic turns by Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman, and of course, that winning performance by Christopher Reeve in the title role. Believe a man can fly? You bet!"
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects, and -- you know what else? Wit."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Estimates of the movie's costs range between $35-and $70-million; whatever the price, it was not too much to pay. As gods go, Superman is one of the godliest; his movie is one of the best."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"Magnify James Bond's extraordinary physical powers while curbing his sex drive and you have the essence of Superman, a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy."
Superman,7.4,134218018,100,"A movie that is pure escape and good, clean, unadulterated fun."
Superman,7.4,134218018,88,"There's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made."
Superman,7.4,134218018,88,"Effective both as Superman and as the bumbling Clark Kent, Christopher Reeve still seems ideal for the part, if for no other reason than his ability to summon up a convincing sense of intensity when charged with saving the world."
Superman,7.4,134218018,83,"Despite a lull here and a lapse there, this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable, doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras -- Christopher Reeve."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"it's the simple, earth-bound quality of the film that makes this comic-book fantasy soar."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"Superman is a bastion of blockbuster innocence, a movie that’s a studio product, certainly, but also something that could have grown from one of Smallville’s sun-kissed cornfields."
Superman,7.4,134218018,80,"The film is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out into giggly camp--as it does, finally and fatally, when Lex Luthor enters the action; Gene Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit."
Superman,7.4,134218018,75,"Superman is good, clean, simple-minded fun, though it's a movie whose limited appeal is built in."
Superman,7.4,134218018,70,"A highly entertaining, though undemanding mixture, of sci-fi, romance and comedy, which could hardly have come off at all at any lower artistic level, nor without such a happy choice for the central part as Christopher Reeve."
Superman,7.4,134218018,70,The film allows naiveté and knowingness to coexist. Only when it goes all out for cold Batmanesque villainy in the second half does it narrow its focus and lose its way.
Superman,7.4,134218018,60,"The film burdens itself with too many story lines and an overlong (though beautifully photographed) prologue, but things really get moving when Reeve takes the screen."
Superman,7.4,134218018,60,"Superman doesn’t have enough conviction or courage to be solidly square and dumb; it keeps pushing smarmy big emotions at us—but half-heartedly. It has a sour, scared undertone."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,100,Enormous fun.
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,100,"Director Brian De Palma is having too much fun zipping around curves and hitting the accelerator to slow down. He's a supremely confident engineer, and if you're game enough to make a jump for it and hold on, he offers the giddy excitement of watching the ground rush by beneath your dangling feet."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,90,"Exciting, smart and enormously enjoyable."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,90,"A sleek, whooshingly entertaining update of the vintage television series."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,80,"The bottom line on a film like this is, Tom Cruise looks cool and holds our attention while doing neat things that we don't quite understand--doing them so quickly and with so much style that we put our questions on hold, and go with the flow."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"It's a movie of profoundly convoluted pop pleasures. Between dazzling suspense sequences, it invites the audience to work for a good time."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"Unlike most action films, Mission: Impossible's distinct appeal operates not so much on suspense but on improbability."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"All Mission Impossible had to do was not self-destruct. Mission accomplished. Does it ignite? Not really, but Tom Cruise's first adventure as a producer has just enough hightech firepower, old-fashioned star power and a director who knows how to harness it all."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,"This movie isn't a disaster, but, all things considered, there's little reason to make it a high priority for theatrical viewing."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,75,Holes in the script cause the narrative to burp at times.
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,70,"Mission: Impossible proves something of a letdown, not just because it's fairly easy to guess who the bad guy is but also because we've hardly gotten to know anyone in the movie well enough to become more than superficially involved with them."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"Whatever the reason for its disappointments, Mission: Impossible is a mission gone awry, prompting you to hope that reruns of its television incarnation will pop up on cable soon."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"Some of the suspense set-pieces are impressive, but the picture would pack a greater wallop if it were stitched together more tightly and consistently."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"The result is a gracefully plotted spy film in the classic mode, with just enough self-consciousness to keep things interesting."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,"The movie comes alive in bursts such as a train-top fight hampered by gale-force winds. Cruise's star wattage may hog the show, but it insures that Mission: Impossible won't self-destruct easily."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,63,Every effect is so calculated that only the conscious minds of filmmakers and viewers are engaged--and not by very much or for very long.
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,60,"Humorless, charmless and flat."
Mission: Impossible,7.1,180981856,60,"It's the worst kind of convoluted thriller -- it can never unravel satisfactorily because there's nothing simple at its center, just more confusion."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,80,"Like a good episode of ""Smallville"": You may feel a bit silly watching it if you're past high-school age, but you just might have a good time."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,70,"The appealing new kid-on-the-teen-angst block, reverberates with much of the same dark combustible mix of action and romance that's been fueling the ""Twilight"" vampire mega-franchise for a while now."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,63,Brit hunk Alex Pettyfer has grown into a solid and quite interesting lead to build this potential sci-fi movie series around.
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,60,If you can make it through the bland schmaltz of the first half you'll be rewarded with a spectacular blast of sustained action and the promise of even better to come. This could be the start of something great.
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,60,"While Caruso will fail to win over adult reviewers, I Am Number Four will connect with teen moviegoers anxious for a new young adult fantasy fix to hold them until the next ""Twilight Saga"" hits in November."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"Four is so cobbled with bits of other sci-fi and comic-book movies, there's little to distinguish it."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"There are entertaining moments along the way, and some likeable characters."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"Say this for I Am Number Four: It's blessedly free of any original sins. Instead, they're all copied. Here a little ""Superman,"" there a bit of ""Spider-Man,"" now it's ""Twilight"" with aliens, then it's a spaghetti western with trucks – this thing borrows more heavily than an investment bank in an unregulated market."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"Best reason to stay home and rent ""Disturbia"": I Am Number Four is a little better and makes loads more sense than ""Eagle Eye."" But neither has the sass and pluck of ""Disturbia."""
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,With clunky dialogue...I Am Number Four puts the burden on its special effects (passable) and the chemistry between Pettyfer and Agron.
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"A well-made, reasonably diverting night at the multiplex that will seem overly familiar to everyone except teenage girls."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"Producers Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg deploy an arsenal of noisy special effects to demonstrate the invaders' high-tech superiority, which makes Olyphant's inability to breach an Internet firewall look pretty silly."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,I found the mythology of I Am Number Four vague and sloppy.
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"Nothing but a million little pieces from prior superhero series and the ""Twilight"" saga."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"A flashy, lunkheaded sci-fi extravaganza sure to appeal to teenagers who like their interplanetary warfare bloodless, their high-school soaps squeaky-clean and their numbers countable on one hand."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,50,"The movie is a mixed bag, with many of the elements fun and intriguing, but since this is also a Michael Bay-produced movie, CG monsters and cartoon bad guys gum up a third act."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,45,"It's tailored more to a gamer's eyes and expectations than a moviegoer's. On the whole the scenes play like levels, with one connecting in only the most basic way to the next."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,42,"Frey didn't really need a ghostwriter for this story, he just needed an archivist with a Xerox machine and a mercenary streak."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,40,"Sluggish and derivative, I Am Number Four is another elaborate puberty metaphor with superpowers substituting for testosterone."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,38,"The recycling goes as deep as the dialogue, which is a mangled and blended refrain of clichés."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,38,"The cheap, indifferent, teen-alien thriller I Am Number Four delivers none of the spectacle of a competent sci-fi film, none of the emotion of an effective teen romance and none of the giggles of a kitsch fiasco."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,38,"What we have here is a witless attempt to merge the ""Twilight"" formula with the Michael Bay formula."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,30,"There are gaping holes in logic throughout this sloppy, cheap-looking mess from ""Disturbia"" director D.J. Caruso."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,25,"Unoriginal and woefully half-baked, Number Four plays out as such."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,25,"For all of its homicidal aliens and toothy beasts, I Am Number Four did contain one element that genuinely unsettled me: the line ""produced by Michael Bay."" Nooooooo!"
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,20,"I Am Number Four, with its gangly title, seems like a dimwitted cousin to those hipper properties - a Superman-come-lately tale of puppy love, extraordinary powers and puberty that's duller than a chalkboard and less powerful than an extraneous Jonas brother."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,20,"It was boring and silly but not atrociously bad. No, that's much too glowing; allow me to back up and rephrase. It is atrociously bad, basically."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,20,Check the credits: That move is ripped straight from producer Michael Bay's playbook.
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,16,"Witless, insultingly derivative, muddy-looking, and edited in the hammering epileptic style that marks so many films produced, as this one is, by Michael Bay."
I Am Number Four,6.1,55100437,10,"I Am Number Four's CGI sequences are murky and dark, its performances negligible, its script genuinely inept. There is, I should note, a puppy, which arguably keeps the film this side of completely unbearable, but just barely."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"This is the kind of pure entertainment that, in its fullness and generosity, feels almost classic."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"May show both director and star working at their professional peaks, but I don't think it's as good as that underappreciated masterwork ""A.I."" It's not as resonant and daring, not as full of magic and marvel. Spielberg stretches himself technically here but not emotionally."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,A heart-pounding experience that makes you think and contains a gallery of characters that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"It affirms that, even in the 2000s, movies do not have to be brain-dead to be exciting. When the season is over, Minority Report will more than likely stand out as the best picture to grace multiplex screens during the Summer of 2002."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"This film is such a virtuoso high-wire act, daring so much, achieving it with such grace and skill. Minority Report reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,100,"Stripped of all bravado, Cruise delivers a raw and probably detractor-proof performance. Spielberg does what he did right in creating a novel milieu for ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"" but this time the writing is fresher and anything but unwieldy."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,91,"A happy surprise: a timely antidote to the comic-book mindlessness of ""Spider-Man"" and repetitive space fantasy of ""Star Wars,"" and an encouraging bid from the top of the A-list to once again reach very high and spit in the face of the gutless formula filmmaking that rules Hollywood."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,Few directors are capable of marrying ideas and entertainmentone is often sacrificed for the otherbut Spielberg peppers one gripping action setpiece after another with trenchant details about a near-future robbed of the most basic freedoms and privacy.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,It's a dark and dazzling spectacle.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"Where Minority Report succeeds is by dishing up a little bit of everything  to see no one leaves the theater disgruntled. There are helpings of science fiction marvel, theres some interminable tension and a real human story underneath it all. The specials effects are damn impressive to boot."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"Terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi, incomparably better than ""A.I."" and as dark a movie as the director has made since ""Schindler's List."""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"This is a fiendishly complicated whodunit -- or, to be more precise, a who-done-what-to-whom-and-when -- told within the confines of thoughtful, speculative science-fiction."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,The film moves swiftly and unerringly to its conclusion. Spielberg remains under Stanley Kubrick's directorial spell.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,90,"The most compelling question dangling at its end is, ""Didn't Steven Spielberg used to know how to bring a movie to an end?"""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,88,"Spielberg takes assured control. In his hands, Minority Report is a classy, chilly quasi-Hitchcockian affair."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,88,"The first 20 minutes are masterful, as Cruise hunts down a killer-to-be; the last 20 are mediocre, as screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen untangle the mystery they've grafted onto Dick's story. In between lies a conventional but expertly realized cop-on-the-run drama."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,83,"Spielberg's dark side may not be where everyone wants to live, but it's somehow encouraging to know that he has one."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"May be a shade too serious and contemplative to completely enchant the thrill-seeking masses, while simultaneously seeming too mainstream-minded and genre-bound to be entirely embraced by highbrows."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"It's not the crowning achievement in Steven Spielberg's oeuvre, but Minority Report stands on its own sturdy sci-fi legs, and there's no sign of that little imp Haley Joel Osment, to boot, thankfully."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"Taut entertainment that juggles brainy ideas about perception, predetermination and free will - and drops things in a messy third act where the vintage noir gets bathed in a bit too much Spielbergian glow."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,80,"Cruise will never be a master thespian, but there's no one better at putting across the charisma of control, and the opening sequence of ''Report'' is an astonishingly fluid demonstration of his gifts."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,78,"Its most vivid scenes -- a visit with an insane ophthalmologist, a showdown at Anderton's supposed crime scene -- have the kind of anything-goes creativity that set ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" apart from the crowd last year."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"The mechanical beauty and android possibilities of the future excite the filmmaker, and that's where Minority Report becomes an alluring postcard from the edge. But it's an edge over which Spielberg never seems to want to step."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"Whose idea was it to turn Minority Report into a mushy declaration of humanism? It ends up as less of a warning about an Orwellian police state than a protest that Pre-Cogs are people, too. It's Dick-less."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,"Though he can still deliver an amazing scare, Mr. Spielberg's interest now leans more toward exposition rather than the anticipatory. He is explaining the fun away."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,75,One of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"It's not the kind of work that wins awards, but without Cruise's intensity almost willing our interest in Spielberg's unrelentingly dark world, Minority Report wouldn't have nearly as much life as it does."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,More humdrum than horrible. It isn't futuristic film noir; it's just everyday film beige.
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"We'll never know what might have been, as eye candy and food for thought replace real thrills in the cool but cold Minority Report."
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"Miscast, misguided, and often nonsensical, Minority Report is nevertheless the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since ""Jurassic Park."""
Minority Report,7.6,132072926,70,"Give Steven Spielberg some dinosaurs or a cute, funny alien and he'll spin populist sci-fi till the Arcturan cows come home. Give him a philosophical story about technology changing what it means to live in this world and he'll craft a hodgepodge of shallow and unexplored ideas."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,90,A first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,88,"Blisteringly fast, Bourne also has a strong or striking supporting actor around every corner: Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in roles that range from meaty to amazingly small."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,88,"One of those rare thrillers where the cops aren't fools, villains don't turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,83,"Somehow the movie works like a clock. Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The full-throttle approach of director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go) is impressive."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,There isn't a dull or dumb moment in this movie.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,The result is an escapist fantasy that is -- Damon's and Potente's persuasive performances aside -- as weightless and inconsequential as a musical. And at the moment every bit as welcome.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The movie is a generic paranoid espionage fantasy, but its proportions are refreshingly correct. It moves quickly, adroitly, and without fuss."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"This is an entertainment that really entertains because any number of interesting and unexpected choices were made, starting with the selection of Doug Liman as the director."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Entertaining, handsome and gripping, The Bourne Identity is something of an anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism. It is, by today's standards, a modest thriller, with a self-contained storyline and with very few big special effects."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"Liman packs enough firepower into The Bourne Identity to please the summer action fan, including a reshot climax that contains one of the niftier stunts I've seen recently. The centerpiece action sequence is a bravura car chase through Paris, yet the moments that bookend it are equally impressive."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,80,"The result is not only entertaining but also refreshing, a shameless crowd-pleaser with a healthy cynicism about itself."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,78,"A skillful action movie about a plot that exists only to support a skillful action movie. The entire story is a set-up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well-crafted and acted, we give it a pass. Too bad it's not about something."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts. The movie has credibility issues, but none are insurmountable in the name of entertainment."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Damon, starring in his first full-fledged action pic, brings a determined bearing and believability to the proceedings."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Though it's clearly meant to be character-driven, the movie is thrown out of whack by a total lack of chemistry between the leads, and some great acting (Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox) on the side."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"Director Doug Liman -- the hip skipper of ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" -- makes all the familiar dirty business seem fun and almost human. In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"A lean, deftly shot, well-acted, weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures. There are even moments when you hope it could turn into a modern ""Charade."""
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,"The problems with Damon's character are the problem with the movie: It's about plot mechanics, not heart and soul."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,75,This savvy adaptation of Robert Ludlum's action-clogged 1980 bestseller benefits from the fact that the filmmakers were smart enough to throw out most of the book's preposterous spills and thrills and concentrate instead on its intriguing central character.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,70,"May be a bloodless piece of thriller craftsmanship, but at a time when craft has become negligible, its efficiency and whipcrack timing are increasingly uncommon virtues."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,70,"As for Damon, this may not be a performance so much as an appearance. But he cares so utterly, it works."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,63,"Makes one interested in seeing the inevitable sequel, but one is also left to somewhat question the worth of sitting through this first installment."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,63,"It has a few whispers of intrigue, but at the heart of The Bourne Identity lies a dispiriting paradox: The more that Jason Bourne learns about himself, the less arresting he seems."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,"Films borrow tricks from pictures made years ago -- try to watch Bourne without thinking of ""The Manchurian Candidate."""
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,"Next time Damon will have to find a worthier vehicle. As the intended start of a franchise, The Bourne Identity is a bit of a bust."
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,All this is diverting but also borderline dull.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,60,Banal big-budget adaptation of Robert Ludlum's 1980 espionage thriller.
The Bourne Identity,7.9,121661683,58,"The best audiences can hope for is that they, too, get amnesia and forget they ever saw this movie."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,90,This bloody celebration finally gives the American Revolution the epic it deserves.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,90,Doesn't try too hard to be anything other than a vicarious experience that makes you crave the satisfaction you know you'll get when the hero gets his revenge.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"It has everything you want in an epic: sweep, scope, wild reversals of fortune and plenty of bold, basic emotions."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"Sentimental, overbearing, flag-waving--and a crowd-pleaser."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,80,"If Emmerich had any sense, he would have ceded the direction of the battle scenes to his star."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,Has a flag-waving dumbness at its core.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It is rousing and entertaining, and you get your money's worth."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It's big, exciting, ambitious, and it makes you cry in all the right places."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"What might have been a treat for history buffs and a refresher course for the rest of us turns into just another occasion to watch Gibson shoot guns, swing tomahawks, and wreak other kinds of havoc on enemies we've been primed to hate."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"Emmerich might have had a masterpiece, but he'll have to settle for what comes close to being a must-see movie today."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,"It's often corny, but it's never boring, and it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,The best movie I've seen about the Revolutionary War.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,75,It's depressing that this first movie in years to dramatize the American Revolution has so little to do with the politics of secession and so much to do with pop-culture themes of vigilantism.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"Mostly, the movie is riveting, well-done fare -- the stuff of Hollywood epic adventure."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,Has some emotional pull and isn't stuffy and dull.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"Only so much (pop)cornball tubthumping, a sweeping, occasionally stirring, always gorgeous bit of action-figure history."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"There's no denying that Emmerich's film, though a good half hour too long, keeps us watching."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,70,"""We, the people"" have never been big fans of movies about the American Revolutionary War. The Patriot, however, appears to be the movie that will break that historical jinx."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,67,It's a death-wish revenge thriller posing as a lavishly pastoral historical epic.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,67,"Far from the smart historical epic some might have expected, is just another feisty summer shoot-'em-up."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"As a whole, though, the movie is much less magnetic or believable than its star."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"While the film contains some terrific, realistically bloody battle scenes, it has a distinctly Germanic feel, both in its epic heaviness and in the peculiar way it revises the history of the American Revolution."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,63,"Gibson's performance is robbed of his customary humor, and he flounders around in search of the character's core."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Patriot reflects on nothing, except perhaps that the American Revolution was a golden opportunity for Mel Gibson to go postal."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Shamelessly stirring, brandishing Mr. Gibson's anguished masculinity like a musket. It may be effective, but you leave the theater feeling used."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,60,"Trots out more flag-waving wartime cliches than any movie since John Wayne's ""The Alamo."""
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,Does benefit from Gibson's charisma...Whether it is quite good enough is another question.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"A movie of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial Williamsburg sets."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"The film is long, empty and bogus."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Seems likely to stir rebuttal from historians, especially those on the other side of the pond."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,The Patriot makes the Revolutionary War look like super-produced studio footage of the L.A. riots.
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Undeniably handsome..., but no cliché is left unturned, right down to the spray of toy soldiers falling from the hand of a dead child. Everything old isn't new again."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,50,"Whatever extraordinary ingredients are necessary to fashion a 1776 home run, this movie doesn't have them."
The Patriot,7.2,113330342,44,Overblown sanctimony and sentimentalism as corny as the Fourth of July.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,80,"It’s not simply cashing in on the popularity of the TMNT cartoon, but is actually a thoughtful, emotional, and challenging movie about the loss and reconstruction of family. It’s got lots of hilarious one-liners and ninja action too, making it one of the most well-rounded comic book movies that’s not afraid to hold reverence to the source material while also having some fun with it."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,80,"A well-rounded, unpretentious, very funny, knockabout adventure - subtly blended so that it's fun for all the family."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"High-spirited martial arts and comedy, with heavy doses of Star Wars and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"Barron concentrates on keeping the action moving at a brisk clip, drawing on his music video experience to serve up an entertaining series of odd camera angles, gratuitous camera movements and complicated lighting schemes. The results are lively and funny enough to keep adults enthralled as well as kids."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,75,"The most interesting part of the film for a non-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fan is the production design - the sewers and the city streets above them. Roy Forge Smith is the designer, and seems inspired by a low-rent vision of Batman or maybe Metropolis."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"The script is peppered with clever lines even the transformation (and expansion) of cartoon violence into the live arena is achieved without resorting to realism. To balance the fighting, Splinter waxes philosophically on loyalty, perseverance and anger."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"while many reviewers were put off by Splinter's rheumy-eyed philosophizing and the Turtles' ninja antics, the movie's youthful target audience squealed with delight."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"This film debut of the carapaced comic-book heroes features solid animatronic effects and a straightforward approach to superhero adventurism that should appeal to young Ninja Turtle fans, who should be pleased to see the terrapins brought so faithfully to the screen. However, a long-winded plot, broad characterizations and barely adequate fight scenes will prevent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from generating any breakthrough business."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,63,"Jim Henson's Creature Shop has created splendid animatronic characters (including a four-foot talking rat), though extra distinguishing marks between the turtles would be appreciated. Between the dubbed dialogue and the dark visuals, the cumulative effect is curiously dislocating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"The only thing this film has going for it is its improbable title and title song about four fighting turtles changed into upright, man-size creatures by exposure to radioactive wastes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles never rises above its marketing-hook origins. It's a product, a commodity, a toy tie-in, a trailer for the comics, an advertisement for the cereal. It's a naked sell."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,60,"Parents can vaguely console themselves, however, that amid the kiddie pollution available on Saturday morning TV, the Turtles rank slightly better than the rest. At least they care about each other and fight crime for other than fortress-destroying, fascistically gratifying reasons. And maybe, just maybe, this will make them curious enough, one day, to check up on the real Michelangelo."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles was directed by Steve Barron, who has a number of music videos to his credit, and shows off the skills of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, without which there would have been no film at all."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"Children will undoubtedly enjoy the ninja flick a lot more than their parents will, and it probably won't even give most kids nightmares. But couldn't a steady diet of this sort of thing help to desensitize very young children to real violence? If so, that's awful - not awesome - dudes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,6.8,135265915,50,"When a kids’ flick has nothing to offer but cute special effects, it’s easy to think the filmmakers are patting themselves on the backs for their technical ingenuity. That’s not comic fantasy — that’s marketing."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,68,"Assassin’s Creed’s creators have the courage to always take themselves seriously, even when they’re working with material that sounds fundamentally silly. There’s no great leap of faith in Assassin’s Creed, but a surprising amount of the time, it at least finds steady footing."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,67,"Declaring Assassin’s Creed to be the best video game movie ever made is the kind of backhanded compliment that sounds like hyperbole, but the description fits the bill on both counts. Regardless of what you call this peculiar, arrestingly uninviting nonsense, the fact of the matter is that it’s the only blockbuster of 2016 that left me desperate for a sequel."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,63,"By showing signs of intelligent life in a universe of diseased, digital drivel, Assassin's Creed stands above the herd of movies based on video games by default."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,63,"It also has great momentum, good set pieces, and so much frothy nihilism it’s just plain fun."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Assassin's Creed will be polarizing, but it's fascinating as an entry in Kurzel's oeuvre. It is singularly his film — both in style and the obsession with hubris, power and violence."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"The frenetic action is Assassin’s Creed’s saving grace. Inventively choreographed and beautifully executed, its game-inspired brand of wushu-meets-parkour delivers some genuinely awe-inducing feats."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Assassin’s Creed makes you actively work for its pleasures, and it’s heartening to see a film of this scale that’s strange and ambitious and doesn’t spoon-feed viewers every little detail."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"The relentless gloom can feel oppressive, but there’s plenty of ambition here, especially in the layered storytelling and woozy sense of time and place, with plenty of soaring aerial shots that nod quietly to the all-seeing eye of a computer game."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,60,"Valiant, but flawed. Some of the set-pieces are superb, but there isn’t enough meat on the bones to turn this into a classic."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"Obtuse, narratively incoherent, and ultimately frustrating, it stands as another example of how hard it is to make a good mainstream movie out of a popular computer game."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"The effect is less video-game-turned-movie than zombie movie minus zombies: stilted, static, s-l-o-o-o-w. The ending couldn’t set up a sequel more clearly if “To be continued” appeared on a title card. Don’t count on it. Game on? Game over."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,The picture has an undeniable rough stylishness...but in terms of coherence of storytelling it leaves the audience choking on all that swirling dust.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"What saves this head-scratching, relentlessly portentous movie is what also saves the games: the action is on point."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,It’s incrementally more fun than it is silly.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,"Assassin’s Creed is nearly wall-to-wall violence, but Kurzel reveals an eye for widescreen composition that, paired with Christopher Tellefsen’s efficient, hyperactive editing, gives the film the tenor of a sophisticated graphic novel."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,50,Assassin’s Creed bears a jumbled narrative and self-serious approach that ends up feeling far too assaultive on the senses without any genuine pay-off.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,42,"The movie is at least interestingly confusing until about the halfway mark, when monotony sets in for good."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,42,It’s all window-dressing for an ending that reveals this alternately goofy and self-serious big-budget Hollywood product to be little more than a two-hour prelude to a potential future franchise.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,40,"Assassin’s Creed is leaps and bounds ahead of kitchen-sink-hurling flapdoodle like X-Men Apocalypse – it’s only the second-worst Fassbender star vehicle of 2016 – but it never allows him a sober moment, as that film did in a hushed Polish forest, where his talent, as opposed to his biceps, gets a stern workout."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,40,"In Assassin’s Creed, Michael Fassbender is like the ultimate special effect. Just by showing up, he confers respectability on two hours of semi-coherent overly art-directed video-game sludge."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,Never before have such acting heavyweights been so misused on screen.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,"Unlike the actual video game, Assassin's Creed isn't ridiculous and fun, but rather ridiculous and turgid."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,38,"Quest or no quest, cool locations or green screen soundstages, shirtless Fassbender or Fassbender in an assassin’s hoodie, “Assassin’s” never breaks the creed of Hollywood filmed video games — “Action packed, but dull.”"
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,Any fans hoping that Assassin's Creed would break the long streak of poor video game adaptations are bound to be disappointed by this nearly incomprehensible mess.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"Another entry in a long line of good video games adapted into terrible movies, Assassin’s Creed is ragingly stupid. That its incoherent plotline is treated with the utmost reverence by skilled thespians only brings its idiocy into sharper relief."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"For an ostensible action movie, the cast spends an awful lot of time standing around and looking lost. I can only guess that they were following their director’s lead."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"The acting offers little relief. Fassbender gives a super serious performance in a movie that needed his natural sense of humor. Playing his Abstergo doctor, Cotillard's accent is so bizarre and disconcerting, it's impossible to believe she’s the same actress who’s been so amazing in everything else she's done. As for Jeremy Irons, who plays her scientist father, it's hard to imagine this is anything more than a payday."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,"Assassin’s Creed is resolutely stone-faced, ditching the humdrum quips that are par for the course in today's blockbusters. But this is almost two hours of convoluted hokum that might have benefited from a few self-deflating jabs."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,The Assassin's Creed movie is about all the parts you might skip in the games.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,The plot is that most dreadful of mixes: both laughably silly and needlessly complicated.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,30,Assassin’s Creed the movie is fairly innocuous. It’s also cheerless and dumb.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"Here’s a film that turns Michael Fassbender into a puppet, and oh, those strings hold him down."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"It's just a mediocre action movie, poorly edited and larded with a terrible musical score, based on a video game. Nothing new there."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,25,"As might be obvious, I’m not a gamer, so perhaps all of this will be thrilling for fans who’ve played it. The rest of us, I imagine, may come out of this film invigorated with a creed of our own: Avoid movies based on video games."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,20,"Assassin’s Creed is a dour, lifeless film that leaves those familiar with the material perplexed, and those ignorant of it downright clueless."
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,20,It’s rare to see a film quite so lacking in animus. It exists only to gouge money out of gamers. They might well want to stick to the game.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,12,The film ends up with both blurry action that often looks digitally faked and a fractious plot that’s stuck over-explaining itself.
Assassin's Creed,5.8,54647948,10,"I suppose you could say the film made me slightly more likely to play one of the games, but only because I’d do just about anything before I saw this movie again."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,90,"Fabulous mental escape. It's fun and playful, rather than dark and foreboding. And there doesn't seem to be an original cyber-bone in the movie's body. But it's put together in a fabulous package."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,88,"The perfect sci-fi movie for a post-9/11 world, in that it tells us we're afraid of threats hiding in plain sight."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,88,"This is a movie to restore the faith of those who had given up on science fiction after ""The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions."" By adeptly combining action and ideas, it proves that Hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,80,"The effects, arguably the best of the year, only add to the thrill."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,80,"Once this movie gets going, it works, and it works well. It has a slow buildup, but its final third manages to generate some eye-popping thrills."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,80,"Smith makes it look easy, but underneath the physical high jinks and slick veneer of I, Robot lies a performance of real discipline and intelligence."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,It's a high-tech thriller that really works.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Less ambitious than ""Blade Runner"" but more coherent than ""Artificial Intelligence: A.I.,"" which it vaguely resembles, I, Robot is best during homely moments when Smith shows his human side."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,For its first two acts this flashy vehicle is an anodized titanium streamline baby. Then comes a robot rumble that brings the action to a crashing halt.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Although I, Robot provokes thought, it doesn't exactly deliver thought, despite the occasional Cartesian reference to ""ghosts in the machine."""
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Moves along with great speed and verve, and it's got just enough of a sci-fi sheen to make things interesting, if not provocative. Philosophers and true believers may be disappointed, but for movie fans, I, Robot mostly delivers the goods."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"Hollywood's umpteenth tale of robots run amok is surprisingly smart, cool-looking, nicely paced and well-acted."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,75,"A summer action movie that has a brain and doesn't let it atrophy? Fan me, I'm fainting!"
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,70,"It's much more of an action flick than either ""Metropolis"" or ""Blade Runner,"" but there's a provocative and visionary side to this free adaptation of Isaac Asimov's SF classic that puts it in the same thoughtful canon."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,67,"A routine Will Smith cop-on-the-hunt thriller at heart, I, Robot lacks imaginative excitement."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,67,"It dares to test the audience in several ways: It may not be Asimov but its plot is truly labyrinthine, it works a specific theme (the very real possibility that robots will evolve on their own) and it's happy to end itself in a shroud of enigma."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,67,"Proyas does a jaw-dropping job, particularly in the opening scenes, of depicting Chicago in the year 2035."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,63,"A movie of its kind and of its time -- functional, professional, slickly manufactured and slouching toward consciousness -- I, Robot is a perfect slave to mechanical convention."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,63,"A slick, shiny video game of a movie bursting with computer-generated chase scenes and cool gadgets."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"Lacks both the intellectual rigor and the soulful sublimity of ""A.I.,"" but it nonetheless allows some genuine ideas and emotions to pop up amid the noise and clutter."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"While not a classic by any means, is still a mostly entertaining experience."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"Although Sonny is computer generated, Tudyk supplied his voice and body language -- provides the story's emotional core, an irony Asimov would surely have appreciated."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"In the end, I, Robot is just an assembly-line product of a not very advanced model."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,60,"A cluttered, awkward blockbuster that's just smart enough to get itself into trouble."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,Proyas creates a futurescape that's snazzy in a Blade Runner lite sort of way and one or two of the film's effects are eye poppers.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,Proyas merely assembles a mess of spare parts from better movies.
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"Performances, plot and pacing are as mechanical as the hard-wired cast."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"A humans vs. robots saga that feels machine-made, I, Robot looks to have been assembled from the spare parts of dozens of previous sci-fi pictures."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"It walks and talks and moves very fast, but it never lives."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"The film works best as a kind of mindless, action-packed B-movie. But on the A-level at which recent science fiction/fantasy films operate -- meaning the ""Spider-Man,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""Terminator"" series -- this movie falls woefully short."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"A stylish, watchable, very familiar future-cop action thriller. What was once original is now almost completely derivative."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"The plot is simple-minded and disappointing, and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci-fi CGI genre. The robots never seem to have the heft and weight of actual metallic machines, and make boring villains."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"If you subtracted from the story and style components recycled from landmark sci-fi films of Hollywood past, youd be left with Will Smith wisecracking over a box of unformatted floppies.  I, Unimpressed."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"I, Robot strives to be so many things that it ultimately falls away to nothing, a heap of expensive metal parts."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,50,"More disturbing, yet another robot, or maybe two, seems to have written a Hollywood script and hijacked a major studio production. Given the film's assembly-line screenplay and mechanistic storytelling, no other explanation seems viable. Certainly no one with a heartbeat or taste would blow so much talent, time and resources on such rubbishy writing."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,40,"The films accumulation of unnecessary complications, bad visual choices, one completely superfluous character (LaBeouf), and tonally inappropriate quips makes us distractedly ponder the limits of human rather than artificial intelligence."
"I, Robot",7.1,144801023,40,"If you see it, the sequel will be your fault."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,95,"Dredd works because it's an action flick with wide appeal that takes risks it doesn't need to - in its delightfully off-putting violence and daring style - and those choices pay off in a singular and exhilarating movie experience. It's savage, beautiful and loads of fun."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,83,"Paul Leonard-Morgan's thumping techno soundtrack is thrilling. And Urban manages to give a credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-Eastwood voice - and his chin."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"This is a film that aims squarely at respecting its source’s established fan base, and cares little for casualties who can’t hang on through its grindhouse paces."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"What's exceptional is the orchestration of color, form, light and dark (lots of dark), 3-D technology and digital effects into a look that amounts to a vision."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,Dredd is proudly degenerate - and it never feels compelled to slow down and explain itself.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"The impressively lean script by Alex Garland (28 Days Later) is shorn of almost all superfluity beyond a few dud Schwarzeneggeresque kiss-offs, while Anthony Dod Mantle's sensational widescreen cinematography harkens back to the tension-inducing inventiveness of early John Carpenter."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"In a world of compromised adaptations, Dredd is something of a triumph."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,80,"Pitched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, Dredd 3D feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,78,"Absolutely, 100% kickass. Now would someone please get busy on the ""Tank Girl"" do-over, please?"
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"This, finally, is the Dredd movie comic book readers have been anticipating."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"The themes are also dated. There are times when Dredd 3D feels like an escapist companion piece to ""The Day After."" But there we go again, thinking too much. No sense in ruining such a fine piece of cheap entertainment."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"Fitfully uneven, Dredd is nevertheless an intriguing consolidation of action-movie excess -- and even makes a solid case for its aesthetic appreciation."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,The story places a premium on delivering its disreputable sex-and-violence goods with a minimum of fuss or pretension.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,75,"If there's a serious disappointment, it's the villain. Ma-Ma, despite being played with over-the-top zest by Lena Headey, isn't a very impressive foil for the mighty Judge Dredd, even when she calls for ""back-up."""
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"Dredd 3-D places you firmly in an unreal, dreamlike world and rouses you with its unexpected grace and its rhythms and its movement. The plot ceases to matter after a certain point: This is a great big beautiful music video, and there's nothing really wrong with that."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"This breathless science-fiction thriller isn't just gory. It practically revels in graphic violence, with several scenes shot in excruciating slow motion."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,70,"Grim, gritty and ultra-violent, Dredd reinstates the somber brutality missing from the U.K. comicbook icon's previous screen outing."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,67,"Dredd is a video game procedural tied to great visuals, but one without deeper substance to make its experience remotely meaningful."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,63,"For sci-fi action fans, it's an instant classic. For everyone else, it's a dark, bloody mess."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,The stylish sci-fi film makes some eye-popping and unexpected choices that add up to one heck of a fun film.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,"There was much to dread about this new iteration of Dredd, but it's a solid, occasionally excellent take on the character, with Urban's chin particularly impressive."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,60,"Grungy, compact and delightfully violent, Dredd wants to hit you as hard as it can. The sequel may be the movie you really want, but for now, justice has been done."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,50,"Dredd's cinematography is one of its strongest assets speaks to the film's larger problems - the parts and pieces just don't have the total impact they should, like a punch sailing helplessly through the air rather than forcefully smacking its target."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,50,"Pretty clearly determined to deliver the antidote to Stallone's movie, the filmmakers take their cues from Christopher Nolan's Batman filmscape, dropping Dredd into a fictional concrete sprawl (actually South Africa) that's relentlessly grounded, visually and dramatically. In a generic way, the environment works."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,42,"Olivia Thirlby adds some humanity as the empath. And as the scarred queen of a drug cartel, Lena Headey chews the scenery, and some of her costars, with relish."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,40,"Every so often there's a suggestion that a police state may actually be a lousy idea, but this thought dies even faster than the disposable characters."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,38,"Calling Dredd 3D a movie is sort of a lie. It's a premise, and there are levels to reach, and always there's another grimy hallway to stalk, and then you turn right or left, and then kill some more."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,33,"Dredd, a second attempt at making Judge Dredd a movie star, overcorrects, veering in the opposite direction with a dark - literally and otherwise - nearly humorless bit of ultraviolence distinguished largely by a fondness for spurting CGI blood."
Dredd,7.1,13414714,25,All I wanted to do was escape from this aggressively ugly world and its equally unattractive characters. It's not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyperviolence adds up to nothing: This thing is dedd.
Dredd,7.1,13414714,20,"The drug that Ma-Ma trafficks in, Slo-Mo, slows its user's brain to 1% of its normal speed. Dredd unfortunately makes you feel as if you, too, have partaken."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,The best Hollywood movies always knew how to sneak a beguiling subtext into a crowd-pleasing story. Superman Returns is in that grand tradition. That's why it's beyond Super. It's superb.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,"America's favorite superhero reappears in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, and all we can say is, ""Man, oh Man of Steel, it's good to have you back."""
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,"Superman Returns is a lush and enthralling piece of adventure storytelling that's both revisionist AND reverential, putting a timely spin on a timeless character without violating his primal appeal."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,100,It’s all about heart - not that the spectacle falters; this is the finest popular entertainment since the Rings trilogy closed. Superman doesn’t fly - he soars.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,91,"The film is magnificently mounted, it moves like a speeding bullet and it's so respectful of Superman traditions that even the pickiest of die-hard fans should love it. After a lapse of two decades, it revitalizes the franchise and makes it seem fresh and alive."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,90,Grandly conceived and sensitively drawn.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,90,"This Superman, which infuses its action with poetry, soars as a love story filled with epic yearnings, thwarted desires and breathtaking imagery."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,90,"Superman, born in 1938, is still very much alive in 2006. The Man of Steel has so skillfully bent the bars of our imagination that he seems real to us. And in a sense, he is."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,88,Superman Returns is not only a credit to the first two Superman movies; it may be the best of the series. Its combination of romance and fantasy adventure is unparalleled in superhero comic book-to-movie sagas.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,88,A spectacularly satisfying reworking of the legend of Kal-El.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,88,"Bryan Singer's super, soulful and very expensive new resurrection of the venerable big-screen franchise, ups the ante with must-see results."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,80,"Director Bryan Singer positions this new film as a sequel to Donner's film, and his Superman -- played with winning fortitude by newcomer Brandon Routh -- is less a Man of Steel than a Man of Heart."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,80,"The movie may not be a single-bound building-leaper but Bryan Singer reconfigures the daddy of all comic-book sagas into something knowing, witty, and even sensitive."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,80,"The surprise of Superman Returns is that it isn't a funky, ambitious conceptual reimagining, like last summer's ""Batman Begins."" This really IS your father's Superman; it re-creates - and updates, though just barely - the universe Donner invented."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"Superman returns with a bang. Singer tarnishes his hero's halo with just enough sexual longing and self-doubt to make him riveting and relatable. That ""S"" on his suit has a whole new meaning: He's a Soul man."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"The film has such an expansive, likeable spirit."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,A generally thrilling entertainment that's not quite the grand slam you want it to be.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"This Superman is like nothing you've ever seen before, but it tickles something primitive and comforting at the back of the mind. Gorgeously detailed and meticulously realized, it's a homecoming of a movie. Just wait for the theme; you'll understand."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,A rousing spectacle.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"The new Superman has its visionary charms, but there's only so far you can go without great characters."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"Singer's reverence for the 1978 version edges perilously close to mimicry, as if he has no new ideas to bring to the table, but he succeeds in drawing out the Superman myth with simple power and a refreshing absence of irony."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"By giving the hero's inner plight so many dimensions, Superman Returns brings a richer, grander perspective to a seminal character without changing his essence. It's a profoundly personal take on a universal icon, made by a filmmaker who continues to improve with each movie."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"Superman returns, and he's far from inconsequential yet considerably less than super - just a demi-god content to forfeit our love for our like."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,75,"The much ballyhooed movie, far from great and far from short (2 1/2 hours!), is still great fun."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,70,"The fanboy in me loves it, being wrapped in the warm projected glow of nostalgia for a movie I've memorized since age 9."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,70,"Yes, this Superman soars, but he doesn't always take us with him."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,67,Superman Returns has everything going for it except surprise.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,63,"Don't hate him because he's beautiful, decent, awesomely powerful, modest and just plain good. That's the big blue Boy Scout package - take it or leave it."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,63,"Star Routh's presence and the joys of flight keep Superman Returns alive, but all those missteps dog its heels, holding it back like little touches of Kryptonite in the night."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,60,"The film's most striking repeated effect, in which the caped hero dangles dejectedly in space as the Earth turns below him, emphasizes the passivity and loneliness of the character: This Superman's version of flight seems almost indistinguishable from a helpless freefall. Fair enough, but what's he got to be so existentially glum about?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,60,"Singer draws heavily on the 1978 hit that launched the Warner Brothers franchise, with Brandon Routh dully impersonating Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel, Kevin Spacey getting all the good lines as the villainous Lex Luthor, and stock footage of Marlon Brando proving that death isn't always a good career move."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,60,"Contains a dozen winning moments of humor, uplift or exhilaration. But are they enough to justify a 154-minute running time?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,58,"A dull, uninspiring film that combines pedestrian acting, lackluster special effects and deadly pace with a pseudo-religious theme."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,58,"Picture my disappointment as I realized that, for all the pizzazz of Superman Returns, its global weapon of choice would not be terrorism, or nuclear piracy, or dirty bombs. It would be real estate. What does Warner Bros. have in mind for the next installment? Superman overhauls corporate pension plans? Luthor screws Medicare?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"When the hero, his alter ego, his girlfriend and the villain all seem to lack any joy in being themselves, why should we feel joy at watching them?"
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"The movie consistently delivers in lots of little ways, but in a big way only once, in a spectacular sequence that begins with a series of earthquakes and culminates in an airline catastrophe."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,It's hard to see what the point is beyond the usual grandiosity that comes whenever B-movie material is pumped up with ambition and money.
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"I wanted to like Superman Returns, but Singer and company are so concerned about doing justice to Superman’s past, they fail to generate much interest in what, if any, future the franchise might have."
Superman Returns,6.1,200081192,50,"The bigger problem is that Singer’s weighty rhythms are disastrous for Superman, and the movie actually gets heavier in its last half-hour."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,75,"Like every other action movie, it's designed for a 14-year-old boy's mentality, but it's enjoyable enough to turn most people into 14-year-old boys."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,"The Scorpion King, so far from perfect it isn't funny, is nevertheless one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself, namely, an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,Rouses excitement mostly from stuntwork and thesp agility rather than CGI excess.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,"Director Chuck Russell (""The Mask"") keeps the computer effects to a minimum, emphasizing instead the essential ingredients of a Saturday-afternoon serial, namely, venom-tipped arrows, pissed-off cobras and a buxom babe."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,70,"Chuck Russell doesn't make masterpieces -- he makes good B movies (""The Mask,""  ""The Blob""), and The Scorpion King more than ably meets those standards."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,63,Here is a movie that embraces its goofiness like a Get Out of Jail Free card.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,63,"Within the limitations of the genre, the film succeeds fairly well, with enough giddy sophomoric humor, stunning fights, titillating sex, and exotic sets and costumes to keep an audience entertained."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,60,"The film is dumb, formulaic, the other actors are scarcely worth mentioning, and the plot is merely an excuse to set up the action scenes. But it didnt bore me; The Rock is ceaselessly entertaining."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,60,"The movie itself is a live-action cartoon, a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,60,"The Rock manages to play both with a crude candor more genuine than the entertaining if contrived spectacle around him, and a surprising big-screen charisma and ease that makes him a natural-born screen hero."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,58,"Isn't incompetent; it's just plodding and obvious. If anything holds it together, it's The Rock's ironic ability to tread lightly, which the movie is neither fast nor inventive enough to recognize as different from the spirit of Arnold."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,58,"The good news about The Scorpion King is that The Rock turns out to be a charismatic, ingratiating screen presence."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"For a movie with such a misplaced sense of history, The Scorpion King seems afraid to have more fun with its own stupidity."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,The style here is much more in the spirit of the smash and slash of the Conan movies than the banter and computer-generated monsters of the Mummy movies.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"It is possible to make an engaging action/adventure picture of this sort, but The Scorpion King isn't it. The movie isn't godawful, but it's far from inspired, and, as I sat through its 90 minute running length, I found my mind wandering."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"Prototypical summer-movie fare, designed to be consumed, enjoyed, and forgotten all at once."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"It's impossible to overstate how deeply dumb all of this is, but it skims along at a brisk clip and manages not to overdo the nudge-nudge, wink-wink humor."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"Of course, The Rock looks the part, though with a headband and buckskin, he'd also look like Tonto on steroids."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"A dumb movie, but it's also a knowing one: a cheap castle of lewd trivia and corny excitement built on The Rock."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,"The Rock isn't always comfortable delivering dialogue. He's handsome, physically sculpted and farther along dramatically than Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but he's still learning the simple acting skills an action hero needs."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,50,Plays like Abbott and Costello Meet Conan the Barbarian.
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,40,"Bang-bang, kiss-kiss, yawn-yawn. While dull death metal churns on the soundtrack, Johnson engages in one big brawl after another."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,38,"Director Chuck Russell lacks the visual panache, the comic touch, and perhaps the budget of Sommers's title-bout features, which refined a historically grounded B-movie sensibility into pure, gasp-inducing entertainment."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,33,"The movie doesn't stink exactly, but it comes dispiritingly close."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,30,"Ultimately undone by its sheer busyness. The screenwriters never get the story to settle down, and it becomes a case of one damn thing after another."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,30,"Unfortunately, Scorpion King has none of the qualities -- epic sweep, relative originality and heartfelt bloodthirstiness -- that made ""Conan"" so trashily entertaining."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,30,"For all the swords 'n' sandals hoodoo that makes up the wilting backbone of Jonathan Hale's script, the Rock is, nevertheless, fun to keep an eye on."
The Scorpion King,5.5,91047077,25,"As this chaotic barrage of muscle flexing, swordplay, fireballs, crude digital effects and comic-book quips hurls itself off the screen, it's like having several garbage cans clogged with stale pizza, lukewarm cola, soggy French fries and greasy, ketchup-stained napkins emptied over your head."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,70,"If there's one thing going for Last Action Hero, it's the construction of it all. Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"For all of its sensational stunts and flashes of wit, however, Last Action Hero plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through. It doesn't evoke the mystery of the barrier between audience and screen the way Woody Allen did, and a lot of the time it simply seems to be standing around commenting on itself."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"Last Action Hero is something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one. It tries to be too many things to too many different kinds of audiences, the result being that it will probably confuse, and perhaps even alienate, the hard-core action fans."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,63,"The movie isn't mindless; it just has a mind that's a bit junky and muddled. And to their credit, Arnold and his collaborators haven't played it safe. Last Action Hero is a stretch. Unfortunately, it's a stretch that proves the star wasn't that elastic to begin with."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"The performances of both Schwarzenegger and O'Brien are labored, the pacing uneven, and maybe only half the gags work, but there's a certain amount of creative energy and audacity mixed in with all the confusion."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"This is an attempt to be both a high-octane actionfest and a satire on such films, the result of which is the weirdest concoction: the metaphysical blockbuster. No wonder it tanked."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"The film tries so very hard to be The Movie of Summer '93 that it almost makes you sick for what could have been, what should have been, and, in the end, what it is: soulless sound and fury -- action in a vacuum."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,60,"Last Action Hero is sporadically entertaining, but it could have been a whole lot more. Trimmed down and better edited, this film might have been a top-notch satire. As it is, however, it gets caught someplace in between action and comedy, and never really comes across as a solid example of either."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,50,"Hero claims to be a gentle, playful parody of the action/adventure genre, but comes off as a mercenary attempt to cash in on summer movie-going habits."
Last Action Hero,6.3,50016394,50,"Last Action Hero makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience (and itself) that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness. In a sense, the movie's incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,90,"Robocop is as tightly worked as a film can be, not a moment or line wasted."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,88,A first-rate production full of nonstop action and inventive special effects but what truly makes Robocop spellbinding is a superior script.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,It was this love of mayhem combined with a biting comic attack on neo-fascist corporatism - most notably seen in the TV ads for products like the apocalyptic board game Nuke 'Em - which helped raise Robocop above the common sci-fi herd.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,"With its droll underpinnings, Robocop does for cyborgs and Detroit what ""Blade Runner"" did for androids and L.A."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,Robocop is one weird and entertaining hybrid of camp and sci-fi shoot-'em-up.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,80,Robocop is a thriller with a difference.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,75,"Paul Verhoeven, a Dutch director (""Soldier of Orange""), doesn't let the furiously futuristic plot get in the way of the flaming explosions, shattering glass and hurtling bodies."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,75,Great effects and a nasty undercurrent drive this vehicle.
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,75,"The action is skillfully directed by Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven, and there are many bursts of razor-sharp social satire. But the story amounts to a celebration of brute force in a crudely etched law-and-order context."
RoboCop,7.6,53424681,70,"There's a brooding, agonized quality to the violence that almost seems subversive, as if Verhoeven were both appalled and fascinated by his complicity in the toxic action rot."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,88,"Man on Fire, with a best-ever Denzel Washington, is the first (nonreligious) sure thing to hit the multiplex this year."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,80,By no means perfect - a twist in the tale overextends its already lengthy running time - but it is terrific fun.
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"For what Man on Fire delivers, it's worth enduring Scott's hyperkinetic visual techniques."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"It's resolutely grim and rather predictable but very compelling, and it offers a commanding star vehicle for Denzel Washington."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,75,"The dead-serious Man on Fire awakens a genuine sense of bloodlust in the viewer. This is a slick, big-budget, A-list production designed to stoke our basest impulses -- to make us long for, and cheer at, bloody, merciless vengeance."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,70,"No one rises above the material, though, except for Walken, who looks pleased with the paycheck and the top-shelf tequila. As a shady lawyer, Mickey Rourke is smooth and funny, but recognizable only by his familiar purr."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,70,"Washington's stoic persona here conceals a volcanic rage, and the cast of pros--including Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and Rachel Ticotin--support him with relish."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,67,"Ultimately more bleak and furious than most Hollywood tales of this sort. Man on Fire plays it out to the bloody end, like theres no fire extinguisher in Mexico but for the oceans that hold its borders."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Man on Fire, which starts off as a good example of super-glitz moviemaking, gradually turns into a movie on fire -- another helter-skelter, big-studio spending spree. Too bad. It could use a lot more of Walken, Fanning and some more honest drama."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Not too many R-rated revenge pics depend on ""Uptown Girls'"" Dakota Fanning for the stronger scenes. Yet once the 10-year-old star exits the picture, Man on Fire starts blowing a lot of smoke."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,63,"Employs superb craftsmanship and a powerful Denzel Washington performance in an attempt to elevate genre material above its natural level, but it fails. The underlying story isn't worth the effort."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"The film is always watchable, and the confrontations contain undeniable edgy excitement. But even if this weren't a remake, it would be a remake. Hollywood filmmakers have fished these waters so thoroughly that it's virtually impossible to land a big catch."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"One of the more absorbing and palatable entries in the rather disreputable ""Death Wish""-style self-appointed vigilante sub-genre."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"The film as a whole, while possessing a kind of vicious beauty, feels as cold and as embalmed as a corpse."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"Intentional or not, Man on Fire's over-the-top evocation of Christian retribution goes a long way to making this otherwise standard revenge fantasy watchable."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,60,"That there's moral ambiguity to his actions represents some sort of step up from the cinematic norm. Alas, Christopher Walken has very little to do as Creasy's best buddy."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Where Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" radiates freshness and vigor, Man on Fire feels vaguely like something left over from the 1980s, when action heroes were one-note tough guys methodically picking off baddies."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Scott swaddles this fundamentally straightforward revenge story in a jumble of bleary freeze frames, random changes of color saturation and film stock, jump cuts and stuttering montages, splashing text from some menacing word soup onto the resulting collage of chicly disturbing images."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Despite its high craft level and Washington's participation in it, this movie's showy violence is finally as deadening as the over-emphatic violence in these kinds of films generally is."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"A schizophrenic outing from habitually hysterical director Tony Scott (True Romance, The Fan), Man on Fire is a movie of two unreconcilable halves."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"The first hour is sharply directed, character-driven drama that ranks with Scott's best work. Then he lapses into his usual mode - more a bombardier than an entertainer, filling the screen with sadistic violence and arbitrary plot twists. In all, a wasted opportunity."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"It is a good hour too long, although it does boast Christopher Walken."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Seriously, someone needs to stage an intervention, sit Scott down, and tell him that repeated jump cuts, slow-motion shots, and fiddling around with the exposure dont enhance the viewing experience."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Scott apparently decided it was a good idea for his subtitles -- much of the film is in Spanish -- to shimmy across the screen, to fade in and out dramatically, and in general do even more to distract us."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"If your idea of a bargain is two bad movies for the price of one, then shell out for Man on Fire. And don't fret about that incendiary title because this thing is all fuse."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"Whenever the movie's point of view turns omniscient, and we're seeing events from the director's vantage point, Man on Fire becomes a blurry, shaky mess."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,50,"On the plus side, the casting is superb - and the acting, too. Although the context is overwrought and the moviemaking over-the-top, Washington acts from the ticker out."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,40,"Scott's latest exercise in assaultive excess nevertheless lingers for two and a half hours, like a drunken houseguest who won't leave."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,38,"Man on Fire is as ludicrous as ""John Q,"" ""Virtuosity"" and ""Out of Time,"" yet substantially more violent, artificial, self-conscious and dull."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"This is a time-tested movie con, but rarely has it been deployed so contemptibly."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"This movie is a predictable, gruesome piece of business."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,30,"The movie's mortal failing is echoed in the religious medal Pita gives Creasy in a gift of innocent, uplifting love: Finding heft or coherence within all the lugubrious agitation is a lost cause worthy of St. Jude."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,25,"Not even within earshot of a masterpiece, Man on Fire, based on its ratio of production costs to quality alone, may prove to be the worst movie of 2004."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,25,"Man on Fire is ponderous and bloated, dragging the Bible and Giannini into its swirling cesspool. Scott can't give the movie any real emotional weight. And Washington gives his first lifeless performance."
Man on Fire,7.7,77911774,12,"It's dispiriting to see good actors doing smart, solid work with so much unadulterated garbage swirling around them. Scott's art is also death, and we, the audience, are the ones he's jabbing at with his ruthless paintbrush. It's about time someone told him where to stick it."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,70,"I was at least able to follow the plot (which is not to say it wasn't as ludicrous as any Bond film -- just that I could follow it). But most of all this movie has camp value -- it's fun to sit there and make fun of every last detail, and that redeems it quite a bit."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,70,"Hard as it is to justify Bond films on intellectual grounds, there's something invigorating -- and strangely reassuring -- about this sort of picture. It is comforting to feel that should a psychopath threaten the stability of the world, our hero will be ready to wipe the grin off his face and shove him into San Francisco Bay."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,67,"Beyond Walken and Jones’ considerable contributions, A View to a Kill also contains a robust assortment of action sequences."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,63,"Even though Moore sleepwalks his way through the part, making it apparent that he should have departed two films ago, and Tanya Roberts can't act to save her life (although she certainly can scream), we're back to a more conventional, straightforward Bond than the convoluted mess of the previous movie."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,60,"Christopher Walken sleepwalks his way through playing smarmy Nazi geneticist Zorin, where you would think he would have a ball hamming it up as a Bond villain. Indeed, it is a rare moment when Grace Jones makes the biggest impression as an Amazonian (naturally) henchman called May Day."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"This jokey tone couldn’t be more different from the relative self-seriousness of helmer John Glen’s first 007 directing effort, For Your Eyes Only, and frankly, I yearn for more of that class."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"With Sean Connery as Agent 007, James Bond was a human-scale figure, an exceedingly cool guy to be sure, but a guy nonetheless. With Roger Moore as Bond, we are simply watching a lightweight actor stroll through a role."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"A View to a Kill plods along dutifully, observing the rules of the series with dull consistency."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,50,"As lavishly escapist as they are, the latest James Bond films have become strenuous to watch, now that the business of maintaining Bond's casual savoir-faire looks like such a monumental chore."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"As for Bond’s glib wit, which has been running down lately, the screenwriters haven’t solved that problem. Some of his double entendres are older than Moore and one of them had to be used twice."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"Directed by John Glen (For Your Eyes Only), this movie has all the standard Bond components--beautiful women, picturesque locales, thrilling chases--but the time-tested formula is more than a little threadbare here. Moreover, Walken doesn't have the lines, the strength, the presence, or the dastardliness required to be a top-notch Bond adversary."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"Just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next. Even the tony cast of villains—Christopher Walken, Patrick Bauchau, and Grace Jones—can't add any flavor to the grindingly predictable proceedings."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"What's good? A mesmeric, bottle-blond Christopher Walken as Max Zorin, hellbent on global domination as a product of Nazi experiments, Grace Jones' zowie star at his henchman, and Duran Duran's title song. Otherwise, I'm out."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,40,"If there is such a thing as a pulse in movies, there are sections of this one where a defibrillator would come in handy. This is not due to a lack of action scenes but those included are strung together with long, slow stretches."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,38,"There is some magnificent stunt work, which only underscores how inadequate Moore has become. Moore isn't just long in the tooth -- he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes."
A View to a Kill,6.3,50327960,38,"Bond struck camp long ago, so it would seem pointless to complain about the dilution of Fleming's cruel stud into a smirking dinner-jacket with a crude line in double entendres. But the problem here is that the elements which act as consolation in late Bondage are missing."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,91,It's a comedy of manhood for the age of emasculation.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,88,The funniest movie of the year.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,83,"The Other Guys finds McKay back to trying something wildly ambitious with his comedy, and largely succeeding."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,83,"Great casting takes The Other Guys most of the way: Ferrell draws a wealth of good material from his character's oddball ineffectuality, and he partners perfectly with Wahlberg, who's always best at his most incredulous."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,83,This summer's funniest movie.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,80,The Other Guys isn't easy to peg. It's not a comedy that loosens you up and mellows you out; it works by needling you progressively into a state of anxiety.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,80,Nimbly blending comedy and action -- with an affectionate slo-mo nod to John Woo -- McKay does his best work to date here.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,"The film's first 15 minutes are by far the most fun (and could be the best quarter-hour of any movie released this year), with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock letting it all hang out."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,So hilarious that even longtime Ferrell haters (me) can't resist it.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,"At its core, a perceptive satire of the interpersonal boiling points in buddy-cop pictures."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,75,"Ferrell is effortlessly uproarious. And watching hardass Wahlberg, in his first starring shot at farce, shake his sillies out is not to be missed."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"Here the filmmakers are in fine fettle, which goes a long way to make much of the low-brow silliness and slapstick infectious."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"A surprising, laugh-out-loud take on the old buddy-cop genre. It's sneaky and smartly funny, offering an almost perfect balance of action and comedy.  That's the good news. Then there's the matter of the movie's disheartening final 25 minutes."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"It's loud, raunchy, semicoherent and stuffed to the bursting point with heavy weaponry and car chases, most of which involve a red, cocaine-covered Prius that's been pressed into service as a police car. But Adam McKay's comedy of chaos, which he wrote with Chris Henchy, can also be very funny."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,Michael Keaton is a stitch as an emasculated police captain moonlighting as a retail store manager.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"It's a mixed bag with plenty of gags that fall flat, not a comic masterpiece. But it's got tremendous zing, a sense of mischief and a big heart, more than enough to mark it as a delicious shot of caffeinated ice cream, and the summer season's funniest comedy."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,70,"Like some silly summer song that can't be shaken from the mind, this is a catchy enterprise, no better than it tries to be and no less funny."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"Like a padded ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. What would have been very funny for 15 minutes, and pretty funny for 45, doesn't maintain the standard over the course of a feature-length film."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"For a good hour, this is the picture Kevin Smith was trying to make with ""Cop Out."""
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"It's amusingly off-the-wall, but entirely too cluttered to come together."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"As with most Ferrell projects, there's nothing profound going on in The Other Guys. It's just a bit of good, stupid fun, had at the expense of an uber-formulaic genre that has long been ripe for the spoofing. But it also works."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,63,"For the most part, The Other Guys is seriously silly stuff, in the best sense."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,"Skewers the action genre while also finding room for sheer madness. We've still yet to see the equal of Ron Burgundy, but this latest offering is a wonky yet worthy addition to the McKay/Ferrell pantheon."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,"The film, meanwhile, gives Wahlberg and Ferrell beautiful opportunities to turn their anger-mismanagement-meets-milquetoast act into an absurdist version of Abbott and Costello."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,It's dumb and consistently funny.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,60,Wahlberg is surprisingly committed to the ridiculousness.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Opens strongly and front-loads its best gags into the first third of the film. After that, the jokes begin to repeat themselves, and the plot becomes mired in unintelligible details of the white-collar crime."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,A typical vehicle for Ferrell's atypical humor.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,Have you ever seen a movie you half-liked a lot?
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,The Other Guys actually suffers by comparison to its own madcap opening sequence.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Raises expectations that it has no real inclination to fulfill. The movie's best bits would stand alone nicely on YouTube, or on Funnyordie.com, the comic video boutique of which Mr. McKay is an owner and where he sometimes dabbles in short-form hilarity."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Starts out as a hilarious take on cop-movie cliches, then turns into Will Ferrell's own ""Capitalism: A Love Story."""
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,The laughs ultimately take a backseat to a convoluted white-collar crime story.
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"There's a fine line between stupid comedy that's actually pretty smart and stupid comedy that's just dumb, and The Other Guys crosses the line - into realms of unredeeming dunderheadedness - more often than it should."
The Other Guys,6.7,119219978,50,"Following the clues, The Other Guys turns more hectic than antic, and somebody didn't pack enough comedy for this long trip."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,88,"Even with the uniformly good performances — and the standout work from Ms. Green — 300: Rise of an Empire is foremost a triumph of production design, costumes, brilliantly choreographed battle sequences and stunning CGI."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,78,"While very much a “hard R” movie, Rise of an Empire is, nevertheless, the perfect sort of film for rainy weekend afternoons. It’s a spectacle right down to its shattered ships and duplicitous warcraft, and this time out the story’s been leavened and enlivened with plenty of old-school girl power."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,75,"300: Rise Of An Empire is a worthy sequel to ""300,"" stylistically consistent and equally loony, featuring what may well be the first truly can't-miss performance in a film this year."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,75,"The film belongs to Green — maybe the only actress ever to ""graduate"" from being a Bertolucci muse to a bloodthirsty action-flick dominatrix."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,70,"Rise of an Empire might have been essentially more of the same, but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor: Mere mortals of Athens, Sparta, and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis, behold the magnificent Eva Green, and tremble!"
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,70,"Anchored by Eva Green’s fearsome performance as a Persian naval commander whose vengeful bloodlust makes glowering King Xerxes seem a mere poseur, this highly entertaining time-filler lacks the mythic resonances that made “300” feel like an instant classic, but works surprisingly well on its own terms."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,Israeli director Noam Murro does an excellent job of managing and expanding the franchise established so vividly by Zach Snyder.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"Entirely more engaging by dint of being absolutely impossible to take even a little bit seriously. The ruthlessness of Green's character is taken to extremes that meld Medea to the cheesiest serial you can name, and is hence delicious."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,The lack of a creative driver behind the film leads to a level of fundamental dissatisfaction. The movie delivers all the necessary elements but their impact is dull.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,This is digital fake-ism all the way. Audiences bought it the first time; they're likely to buy it a second time.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"Green rules the picture with her nutty stare and her willingness to get nasty in a hot sex scene, but the movie’s main weak point is the Greek general Themistokles."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,63,"The design... is stunning, an improvement over 2006′s “300.” And the action never disappoints. It’s a pity this colorless cast doesn’t hold a candle to the Butler/Headey/Michael Fassbender/David Wenham crew of the original, that the writers couldn’t conjure up thrilling speeches to match the original."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"For all the energetic milling, Rise of an Empire proves superior to its predecessor by making war a game both sexes can play, on nearly equal terms. In comparison, the R-rated ""300"" seems as innocent as Adam in the Garden before the delicious complication of Eve — or Eva."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"The spectacularly brutal fighting is the film's main calling card, and in that ""Rise of an Empire"" doesn't disappoint. Still, in the battle for best guilty pleasure, I'd give it to the Spartans of ""300,"" by a head."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"If 300’s human touch largely came down to Butler’s roaring and screaming, it’s left entirely to Green to goose the sequel into life. Happily she obliges."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"Just as bloody yet much more conventional, 300 #2 offers splashy thrills aplenty but fails to make a watertight case for its own existence. Green, however, ensures it stays afloat."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,60,"It’s all extravagantly daft, moves at a fair clip and is over before you expect it to be."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,The best thing about the new 300: Rise of an Empire is that Zack Snyder didn’t direct it. And the worst thing about it is that Zack Snyder didn’t direct it.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,Stunningly shot and stupidly written.
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,The naval collisions and melees play out in panel-like renderings that are bold and satisfying for the first half-hour but lack the momentum and bombastic je ne sais quoi of “300.”
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,"Basically, if the first “300” was a pep-talk from Coach on how to lose with dignity, Rise of an Empire is an inspirational speech on the value of teamwork."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,50,"Other than for the pleasure of watching Green try to conquer ancient Greece dressed as a distant forebearer of Catwoman, more is less and a little late in this long-aborning sequel."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"It really is pretty dull, though, with the same moments of campy silliness: the same frowning gym bunnies with the same digitally enhanced abs."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"The best thing about the movie, by far, is Green. Her Artemisia is a real nut case with a taste for blood, and Green is the only one in the cast who seems to be having any fun at all."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,40,"The film feels epic in scope, visually at least, but the depth of its deep-focus composition is bitterly at odds with the flimsiness of its characterization and plotting."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,38,"By throwing herself headfirst into scenes that a more cautious actress might beg off, Green earns herself a citation for valour – a Purple Heart in a movie that’s otherwise way too grim and grey for its own good."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,33,"Forgettable and only mildly entertaining, 300: Rise of An Empire seals its own fate at the initial story level by being so deeply invested in its own mythmaking and playing super safe."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Both a prequel and a sequel to the original tale, only with more bloodspilling and slow-motion, and even less wit or truth."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"When the film isn’t sloppily directed, it’s a series of lazy filmmaking tics, including fetishistic slow-motion shots of blood, water and sweat, as well as sundry dismemberments, impalings and decapitations."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"""300"" was an innovative and imaginative action film, but the follow-up, 300: Rise of an Empire, is nothing but a disappointment."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Noam Murro gives the film nothing so much as a hit-refresh on the same glistening, impossibly golden and gray flecks of pixel-barf that have invaded the frames of every tent-pole studio release since the Bush administration."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,25,"Murro doesn’t so much direct as frame and stage, placing the characters against digital desktop-wallpaper skies and constructing each battle scene as a showcase for the characters’ prowess and toughness."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,20,"The only saving grace is Green, the reigning witch-queen of cinema. The smoky-eyed French actress, best known for “Casino Royale,” “The Golden Compass” and “Dark Shadows,” throws her all into the performance, going bare-chested at times, bared-teeth at others. She’s like Elizabeth Taylor’s ""Cleopatra"" possessed by a succubus — which is a good thing. Without her, 300: Rise of an Empire would be bloodless and brainless."
300: Rise of an Empire,6.2,106580051,0,The empty violence and pointless style are only the biggest problems.
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,88,"Harrison Ford - that most decent of decent men - helps to carry the new film on his broad shoulders. With his blunt, Everyman features and sympathetically furrowed brow, he comes off as such a solid, good guy that it's impossible not to care about his upstanding character."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,88,"Apart from the odd titter, this is a sound formula suspense movie with spiffy set piece thrills, directed with assurance by Dead Calm's Philip Noyce and attractively played by the plausibly anxious principals."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"The fierce-looking Sean Bean is outstandingly good as Ryan's main antagonist, and Patrick Bergin brings the right air of calculation to the terrorist mastermind he plays. Several of the film's main sequences, like an encounter between Mr. Bean's Sean Miller and David Threlfall as the police inspector who has been his captor, derive their horror from the looks of pure loathing that these terrorists bestow upon their prey."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"Given the creative recession in the movies, you could do worse than sit through Patriot Games. If this would-be blockbuster slavishly follows summer movie guidelines, it does so well -- or adequately. Neither poisonous nor great, it never loses sight of its mall-movie mandate, to defend American hearth and home against invincible boy-toy bogymen."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"The most interesting aspect of Patriot Games, however, is the casting of Ford as Ryan, given that Alec Baldwin originated the character in the preceding film. In contrast to Baldwin's rather colorless CIA analyst ill-suited for work as an agent, Ford informs his character with believable world-weariness which subsequently transforms into rage at the prospect of harm to his family. In many ways, Ford grounds Patriot Games in a degree of emotion that distinguishes it from most run-of-the-mill action thrillers."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,80,"The high-tech stuff is absorbing. Harrison Ford once again demonstrates what a solid, convincing actor he is, and there's good supporting work from Archer, Thora Birch as the Ryans' precocious daughter, and the irreplaceable James Fox as a British cabinet minister. But at the end, when a character is leaping into a burning speedboat in choppy seas, I wondered if this was exactly what Tom Clancy had in mind."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,"For Patriot Games to have been more than a generic international thriller, it would have needed to take us deep inside the clandestine organizations — the IRA and the CIA — on which Clancy is fixated. That doesn’t happen."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,"Our favorite parts, though, were the moments of unintentional humor, mostly courtesy of Ms. Archer. Her insufferably goody-goody performance makes you wish Glenn Close would show up brandishing a kitchen knife."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,So duff that you wonder why they didn't ask Roger Moore to star.
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,75,"The main problem with Patriot Games, though, is that the inevitable confrontation between Ryan and Miller takes forever to materialize. In the interim, Noyce gets bogged down in the mass of technical detail -- the inside-CIA baseball -- that is such an integral aspect of Clancy's books. On the page, Clancy's research is impressively exhaustive, and if by chance you become bored, you can always skip ahead. But a movie doesn't afford us this luxury. Some of what we're shown about the inner working of the intelligence network is fascinating, but sometimes it can become an irritating distraction. You just want to cut to the chase."
Patriot Games,6.9,83287363,70,"Tom Clancy was right the first time. Paramount's Patriot Games is an expensive stiff. Mindless, morally repugnant and ineptly directed to boot, it's a shoddy followup to Par's 1990 hit ""The Hunt for Red October."""
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"A kicky, twisted thrill ride, with enough laughs to leaven what can be read, at heart, as a metaphor for the modern marriage."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"Expertly tossing off the type of well-sharpened banter that was the domain of Gable and Lombard and Tracy and Hepburn, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie -- no matter what their off-camera status -- make one swell combative couple."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,80,"A full-on action flick, subversive rom-com and weapons-grade star vehicle that’s drenched in Tinseltown glitz, from a director who knows how to put the money on the screen while his tongue’s firmly in his cheek."

Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"Jolie and Pitt project more than just body heat. They convey a multi-faceted attraction, toss off clever repartee and dazzle audiences with their seemingly natural connection. And that's worth watching."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,The screen smokes with sexual heat. But what's really erotic is how much fun the actors seem to be having.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"What makes the movie work is that Pitt and Jolie have fun together on the screen, and they're able to find a rhythm that allows them to be understated and amused even during the most alarming developments."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,"Alas, around about the third act, the idea grows tired and the whole thing gets derailed. Too bad, because it's a good ride until it isn't."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,75,Features some of the best fight and chase footage you'll see all summer.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"In the end, star charisma and Liman's style win us over and we relax into a sophisticated summertime diversion that is noticeably intended for adults."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"There's a car chase that's more fluid and inventive than the much-touted freeway sequence in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" and the stars are nimble enough to make their acrobatics credible--no matter how many stunt doubles the picture employed."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"As he proved with ""The Bourne Identity,"" director Doug Liman can devise an enjoyable little action movie."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Some people will see Mr. and Mrs. Smith as cynical, but I think its heart is deeply romantic, admittedly in an anvil-on-the-head kind of way. It's a love story not for the faint of heart. In other words, it's a lot like marriage."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"The fact that Pitt and Jolie have not been associated with this type of action is something of a help, but what was needed was the off-balance tickle that--to fantasize--Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell would have given it."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Imagine ""The War of the Roses"" remade as a James Bond fantasy, with appropriately high-tech weaponry, and you have some idea of what Doug Liman's heavily armed comedy has in store."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"A tongue-in-cheek allegory on the hazards of harboring secrets in a relationship, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is most entertaining when the Smiths are hell-bent on mutual annihilation."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,70,"Here is ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" inflated to lethal proportion, or ""The War of the Roses"" reimagined as World War III."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,67,"For all the nimbleness of its first half and the chemical zing of Pitt and Jolie, the film devolves into a fractious and explosive mess, hitting the same note of ''ironic'' violence over and over."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,63,Mr. & Mrs. Smith kicks off with panache and star power - and quickly wears out its welcome.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,63,"The problem with Mr. and Mrs. Smith is that it's really two movies in one. The first is a sly comedy/thriller worthy of Hitchcock, and the other is a big, noisy summer action flick."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,60,An exhaustingly elaborate romantic fantasy actioner.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,60,"If the two most gorgeous people in the world alternately bantering and making out isn't enough to compel the attention of the average American moviegoer, then we are truly doomed."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,58,"Pitt coasts through the movie in second gear. I have no idea what he's trying to accomplish with his tight-lipped, low-key performance; maybe he's angling to replace Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible IV."""
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"It's a perfect role for Jolie, whose seductive looks always seem to be concealing something dangerous, even predatory, and she brings out a looseness in Pitt, who fares much better in comedic roles than when playing things straight and stoic (i.e. Troy)."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,Only Vince Vaughn registers hilariously as John's boss.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"An action comedy for suburban women that's as toothless as a newborn, and nearly as stupid. It tries so hard to be cute that it practically drools on your shoulder."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"Maybe my priorities are wrong, but this inquiring mind wants to know when these two will find a movie entirely worthy of his understatement and her naughtiness. This one has its moments, but it's also littered with action-flick junk."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"By the time the film winds itself up, the sophisticated fizz of its first 45 minutes has been smothered by explosive bombast."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"Uneven, ineffective mash-up of sex comedy and artillery-heavy action."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,Jolie has a gangly inelegance that suggests a giraffe trying to hang wallpaper -- but the entire movie is predicated on a spark between its prettier-than-thou stars that seems to have bypassed the screen and ignited in the tabloids instead.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,This romantic-comedy action movie is a fizzle.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,50,"What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing and occasionally incoherent action. Sometimes Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,"To watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which continually sacrifices its potential for sophisticated fun on the altar of style and physical stunts, is to realize how far we've come from the great movies of, say, George Cukor or Howard Hawks."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,"The movie is a technological and publicity triumph, and a calamity in every other way."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,40,It's hard to know what these stars are ready for after this fiasco. Maybe a fitness video.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,38,A deeply stupid and offensive action comedy-romance.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,30,"The movie is a mish-mash of action-adventure clichés, book-ended with lame attempts at psychological interest. Written, directed, and acted with ham-fisted heaviness."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,25,"It may be emblematic of new-millennium Hollywood that this movie has turned out to be one more emotionless, brainless, overproduced action film."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,6.5,186336279,25,"The film is glossy, but awful. Frenetic, but awful. Expensive, but awful. ... And awful."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,100,"Director Duncan Jones achieves a strange and winning amalgam, a gripping action film that also works as poetry."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,91,"This is hair-raising, clever and winning entertainment.  Even if his protagonists aren't entirely what they seem to be or think they are, Mr. Jones is, it's increasingly clear, the real thing."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,91,Showcases Jones' ability to provide ample entertainment value with sharply drawn characters in a minimalist setting.
Source Code,7.5,54712227,88,"An ingenious thriller that comes billed as science fiction, although its science is preposterous."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,83,"Among all the chess-piece players on the board, the star is the only one who really builds a solid emotional foundation for his character."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,The first film in a while to have a decent heart while quickening your pulse.
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"Everything we learn about Stevens and Christina and Goodwin by the end of the film comes from their actions, not their words. That lends Source Code an elusive, almost arty shimmer beneath its glossy, action-movie surface."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"None of this makes any sense if you think about it, but the idea is so much fun that thinking about it may be your last impulse."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"What's really cool about the film - in addition to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Stevens - is how Jones makes sure that we don't know any more than Stevens does, right up till the end."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"A propulsive ride worth your popcorn dollar, not for its preposterous genre tinkering but for its refreshingly humanist take on a high-concept gimmick."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"It's a crackerjack ride, shot and edited for maximum discombobulation."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"An exciting, intellectually stimulating science-fiction thriller which also connects emotionally. Everyone involved earns a promotion to the premiership."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,80,"It's not nearly as complex and eerily existential as the director's debut, ""Moon,"" but in its own way it's an even more satisfying time slice of identity-scrambled sci-fi."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,78,The psychological payoffs outweigh any implausibilities. And what's the harm in logging off your network for a few hours to indulge in some good old-fashioned science fiction?
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"In Source Code, the new thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Groundhog Day"" goes metaphysical. Some people, I know, will argue that ""Groundhog Day"" was already metaphysical. Perhaps, but compared with ""Source Code,"" it's ""Caddyshack."""
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"As popcorn entertainment, it's right on schedule."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,A fun ride of a sci-fi thriller with terrific romantic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan.
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,Michelle Monaghan's clowning response to her boyfriend's sudden histrionics lends the drama a giddy fizz.
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"A taut, mostly well-crafted race against the clock that combines the time-loop conceit of ""Groundhog Day"" and the postwar paranoia of ""The Manchurian Candidate."""
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"A high-octane mind game best enjoyed by following a key character's advice: ""The Source Code is a gift. Don't squander it by thinking."""
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"Working from a tight script by Ben Ripley, Jones creates scary, hairy, high-octane tension. Disbelief? Suspended, until the logic lapses kick in later. It's a small price to pay for a ride that starts at wild and accelerates from there."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"For a while it's the rare film that-in the mold of the first ""Matrix"" movie and ""Inception,"" although on a more modest scale than either-mixes heady puzzles with gripping suspense."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"I'm still not sure what ""source code"" means here. I suspect the actors, the director, and the screenwriter haven't a clue either. But the thing keeps you watching."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"Sitting through Source Code is like watching a chef coax a beautiful soufflé into perfect shape for 80 minutes, then drop a bowling ball on it."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"Source Code is a contraption, no doubt. But it works."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,Well paced and energetic; it's unlikely to bore anyone.
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,White-knuckle fun.
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"Duncan Jones, director of the very fine and very paranoid ""Moon,"" makes this seemingly silly situation work, building tension over 93 minutes."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,75,"Source Code has a resonance that too many contemporary thrillers lack. Gyllenhaal invests Stevens with the simmering anger and grinning charm familiar to the genre, but also with a real sense of vulnerability."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,70,"In crucial ways, Source Code, written by Ben Ripley, recalls ""Moon,"" Mr. Jones's accomplished feature debut about a solitary astronaut played by Sam Rockwell. Source Code is bigger, shinier, pricier."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,70,"With a twisty, mind-bending plot that frequently changes direction and occasionally overreaches, Source Code wouldn't work at all without a cast with the determination and ability to really sell its story."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,70,"A Hitchcockian thriller with a bit of ""Unstoppable"" and a little ""Unknown,""  Source Code is a pulse-pounding flick."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,70,"The script by Ben Ripley doesn't come up with enough obstacles to throw in the hero's path, and his budding romance with the doomed Christina feels more like a studio mandate than an organic development."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,63,"Based on its thrillingly fractured first half - not to mention ""Moon"" in its entirety - Jones seems much smarter than he allows the film to be in the end. It wriggles out of its own intriguing puzzle."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,60,"What begins as a tense, inventive suspense film becomes, to paraphrase Doctor Who, a wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey, mushy-wushy mess. That's decidedly NOT fantastic."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,60,"The movie boils down to one character, acting under enormous pressures of space and time, racing to solve a mystery. In this case, that may be good enough."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,60,"It is a tremendous downer when the second half of the movie shirks logic, defies its own established principles and raises more questions than it answers."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,50,"Gyllenhaal is particularly unsuited to this role, his saucer eyes flashing from calm to crazed."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,50,"Solid execution and some provocative ideas can't save Source Code from a fatal hubris, as it thinks itself far more clever than it actually is and assumes it's earned emotions at which it's only hinted."
Source Code,7.5,54712227,50,Somewhere under all that bloat is the greatest short subject of all time.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,100,"That tale gets a first-class Hallmark Hall of Fame treatment in Kevin Reynolds's swaggering The Count of Monte Cristo, which is old-form moviemaking at its best."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,90,"It's a heady mix of the earnest, the grave, and the frivolous. Wizardly director Kevin Reynolds even manages to condense into a single shot, with a wisp of humor, several of the hero’s long years in a dungeon without making them any less grueling."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,80,"Reynolds, working in close harmony with cinematographer Andrew Dunn (Gosford Park), brings an infectious brio and an occasional sweeping grace to the classic trappings of Dumas."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,80,A lavishly mounted and appealingly old-fashioned swashbuckler with nary a trace of wink-wink irony or revisionist embellishment.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,80,This is the kind of adventure picture the studios churned out in the Golden Age -- so traditional it almost feels new.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,It pays homage to the genre's most glorious days.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The stuff of high romance, brought off with considerable wit, too. People are going to love it."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"Sail to the box office, swashbucklers. Dumas is back in style."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The week's guilty pleasure is The Count of Monte Cristo, a gorgeously photographed, sumptuously designed adaptation of the Dumas swashbuckler boasting the most ludicrous dialogue since director Kevin Reynolds's ""Waterworld."""
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The new Count moves with the smooth, plastic efficiency of a TV miniseries. Inspiration and originality may be in short supply, but the movie gets the job done."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"The film tells an engaging swashbuckler on its own terms, and that's what director Kevin Reynolds has done with this old-fashioned romp of revenge."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,75,"While fleeting moments from Pearce and Luis Guzmán (as Caviezel's loyal servant) suggest the film might have been even more fun had they been allowed to loosen up a bit, the finished product still offers little cause for complaint."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"As a revenge thriller, the movie is serviceable, but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"The best thing in The Count of Monte Cristo is Guy Pearce's snot-nosed hauteur. He gives this scoundrel some wounded edges, and frills as well."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"For younger audiences drawn by the attractive actors, this might be their introduction to the Dumas epic. At least it's an effective and rousing version."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,70,"The story stands up pretty well for a movie that's about 20 minutes longer than it ought to be, and has few of the action-beats that action-film audiences have grown accustomed to."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,67,"Wolpert and Reynolds seem to be aiming for the ''Titantic'' audience at the expense of sophistication and historical relevance. It's too bad. The able cast, not to mention Alexandre Dumas, deserves better."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,67,A mediocre production that nevertheless will strike a deep and resonant chord with viewers.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,63,"This is solid entertainment, and the time Caviezel and Pearce spent training for their sword fights pays off handsomely."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,63,"The film's resolute indifference to fashion makes it, perhaps paradoxically, a refreshing piece of old-style entertainment, accompanied by a whooshing, trembling score by Edward Shearmur."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,63,"This latest version, made with the MTV generation in mind, is arguably the least impressive of the filmed Counts."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,60,This seems to be a movie made by people who love the old classic movie swashbucklers but don't have a clue how to make or modernize them.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,60,"In the end, it's a film so short on style and verve it feels lifeless; audiences might feel imprisoned in the Château d'If, praying for escape or quick death. Thankfully, one need not tunnel out of a movie theater."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,60,"Revenge may be sweet, but this is one ""Monte Cristo"" that leaves a sour taste."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,50,"More fun than Peter Hyams' ""The Musketeer,"" and somewhat less so than ""The Man in the Iron Mask,"" this is middling Dumas all the way."
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,50,To say the film doesn't quite recapture the thrill of the novel is like saying that soda pop doesn't really have the same kick as heroin.
The Count of Monte Cristo,7.8,54234062,50,"This is the time of the year movie studios traditionally dump their mistakes into theaters -- and boy, did Disney make a whopper with The Count of Monte Cristo."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,"Yes, it's fundamentally business as usual, but it's the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form. Abrams imports and enlarges ""Alias'"" smooth, stylish, yet remarkably visceral approach to action, and the actors pack a satisfying amount of drama into the moments between action scenes."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,"A gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,83,It's an expertly engineered popcorn movie - hold the butter substitute - but it also tries (and fails) to be a love story for the ages.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,80,"It's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot. Summer has arrived."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,78,"Bury the nostalgia. Like the rap twist Kayne West puts into the film's classic theme, this movie is best when it stirs it up."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,Against sizable odds -- a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed -- Mission: Impossible III delivers.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"The supporting cast, including Ving Rhames, Laurence Fishburne and gorgeous Maggie Q, is underused, but the movie delivers the goods."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"In Mission: Impossible III, we find out whether it's still possible to look at Tom Cruise and not see a weirdo. The answer is yes, but a complicated yes, because it takes time."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"The end result is the very definition of a summer movie: breezy, undemanding and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"It's overwrought and overplotted, but it's plenty of fun."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Big and fast and silly, but it's never dumb, and it's certainly never boring, either. The summer movie onslaught has begun on a high note."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Unlike the previous two films in this series, Abrams is more concerned with his hero's heart than with his hardware. The result is a pulse-racing thriller that restores the human factor to the franchise, and to its producer-star."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"Though Abrams doesn't possess a fraction of the visual pizzazz of the two previous MI directors, Brian De Palma or John Woo, his incarnation is, from a narrative perspective, better made."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"In his feature debut, ""Lost"" creator J.J. Abrams, who got the job on the basis of ""Alias,"" takes the driver's seat with both feet on the accelerator."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,75,"For all its far-fetched formulations, this new entry maintains more of a dramatic throughline and has the bonus of a villain played with unsparing meanness by Philip Seymour Hoffman."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Cruise is probably the most graceful physical performer to occupy the screen since Burt Lancaster, and in this sort of action role, he's just about peerless...He may not be a great actor, but to find a greater movie star would be a nigh impossible mission."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,Hoffman is so proficient in this role that he just about overmatches Cruise and makes the wait until he speaks again in the second half of the film hard to endure with any patience.
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Abrams keeps the action clicking along in 5/8 time, and Cruise is at his scowling/smiling best as he jumps, shoots and leaves. (See Tom run! Run, Tom, run!) Best is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the baddie; the film's best sequence features him playing Cruise playing him at a swank party in Vatican City."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"In the world of bloated movie-star vehicles, it's not unusual to see an ego trip of these dimensions. What’s rare is when one hits its marks so smoothly."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"M:i:III accomplishes its mission: to run smart variations on dumb tropes. After all, summer movies are not for students but for thrill consumers. Devour and enjoy."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"A film that climaxes in Shanghai shouldn't go down like a meal in Shanghai. But an hour after you see M:i:III, you may be hungry for a real movie."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Shallow to its core and as propulsive as a runaway locomotive, it's the most blatantly summer movie-ish of the Mission Impossibles. And also, surprisingly, the most viscerally entertaining."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,70,"Mission: Impossible III hasn't the kinks or the oddball Continental chic of the first ""Mission: Impossible,"" but it's less pretentious and obsessively pretty than the second movie."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,67,"Though dated and unsophisticated compared to the much cooler Bourne spy thrillers, M:i:III will probably hit the sweet spot at the box-office - and give Cruise a whole new reason to start jumping on couches."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"One of Cruise's most deeply cherished ambitions is to be a great actor, and this movie goes to great lengths to let him do that--sort of. You'll understand what I mean during the sequence in which there is more than one Philip Seymour Hoffman on the screen."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Maybe it's foolish to be disappointed by a pure popcorn movie, but as I walked out of this film, I felt it had failed in its mission of pure entertainment."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"The real objective of all the ""M:I"" movies is to provide a clothesline for sensational action scenes. Nothing else matters, and explanatory dialogue would only slow things down. This formula worked satisfactorily in ""M:I,"" directed by Brian De Palma, and ""M:I II,"" directed by John Woo, and I suppose it works up to a point in M:I III, directed by J.J. Abrams, if what you want is endless, nonstop high-tech action."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Only theoretically, though, is this exciting. Mostly, it all feels like a lateral move that keeps alive a franchise without breaking new ground."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"An inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action gives you an idea how good the franchise could be, but we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"The movie raises your pulse, it has visual wow. But I suspect that audiences will emerge into the light feeling more battered than entertained."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,63,"Producer-star Tom Cruise handed this one to alumni from the TV spy drama ""Alias,""  and the result is nearly as good as the series' best, Woo's Mission: Impossible 2."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"M:i:III, like many blockbusters, would be nothing without its star."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"While all the ""Mission"" plots are convoluted and slightly preposterous -- the keyword in the title is ""Impossible"" -- the latest is just this side of insultingly stupid. The longer you think about it, the less sense it all makes."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Absent the real sense of creepiness and highly honed film craft of De Palma, or the strong visual and emotional sensibility of Woo, M: I III feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films -- saddled, moreover, with a star who's sliding into self-parody."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Clearly designed to be an action thriller with emotional underpinnings. But you can't get blood from a stone, no matter how hard you squeeze. And so Cruise, a huge box-office star, is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of Mission: Impossible III."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,60,"Mr. Hoffman enlivens Mission: Impossible III, which otherwise droops, done in both by the maudlin romance and by Mr. Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent -- evident in his capacity as the television auteur behind ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" -- to a larger canvas."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,58,"Watching this movie is like sitting on your couch for two hours to catch a little network prime time: you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you’ll remember any of it five minutes later. On the plus side, you probably won’t care."
Mission: Impossible III,6.9,134029801,58,"Aside from a single jazzy image of Hunt taking a nosedive off a Shanghai skyscraper, Abrams' movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for Woo's cartoon absurdities."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,Quite literally the blockbuster of the year.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"The CGI effects in this film, directed by Brad Peyton, are quite remarkable and help take one’s mind off the cornball disaster-brings-families-together underpinnings."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"By turns frightening, exciting and ridiculous, San Andreas is, in the end, more impressive than anything else."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"Starting with a mountainside rescue setting up Ray's bravery, through cities ruined and a tsunami leveling San Francisco, San Andreas is gnaw-your-knuckle fun. Which is the roller coaster conflict that comes with the disaster movie genre, the closeness to horrific reality that attracts millions yet repels a sensitive few."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,75,"There are really no surprises here. But the action is bracing, Johnson’s performance is solid and, within its extremely narrow parameters, entirely convincing, and Gugino and Daddario are both gritty and attractive. The result is a pretty exemplary popcorn movie."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,68,"There are big, loud entertainments like “Mad Max: Fury Road” that I find myself enjoying even with my critical-thinking cap on, and then there are movies like San Andreas that somehow go straight to my lizard brain; this movie’s dumb, and its portrayal of urban devastation borders on the pornographic, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t entertained."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,67,"San Andreas shows that sometimes the fake stuff can get the job done beautifully. I don’t want to make any claims that San Andreas is a great film. It’s not. But as mindless sensory barrages go, its fakery taps into something real: It shows us just how impotent we all are to control our planet. Unless, of course, you happen to be The Rock."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,67,"The reason you go see San Andreas is to see what the state of the art looks like when you destroy an entire state, set piece after set piece, and Brad Peyton delivers on that."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,67,"It’s obvious from the start what’s going to happen, and although San Andreas occasionally makes some interesting moves (the swift offing of a character who pops up simply to be annoying is one of them), it’s mostly a paint-by-numbers affair bolstered by jaw-dropping CGI and a desire to completely flatten as much cityscape as possible."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,63,The special effects and especially the 3-D are top-notch.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,63,"I enjoyed large chunks of San Andreas, largely because the actors give it a full load of sincerity, and there's some bizarrely effective comic relief thanks to Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson as Brits who picked the wrong week to visit the Bay Area."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,63,What sells this formulaic corker of Apocalypse Porn is the cast.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,60,"The allure of San Andreas rests entirely on the calibre of its pandemonium, savored, ideally, with a brawling audience on a Friday night. Indeed, it is the kind of movie that makes me want to campaign for the serving of alcohol in leading cinema chains — mandatory beer, I propose, with shots of Jim Beam to toast the dialogue."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,60,"You see San Francisco and Los Angeles falling apart very loudly and dangerously, and in great computer-generated detail. But there’s nothing memorable or beautiful about the carnage; no specific moments to replay in your head once the film is over."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"There are things in San Andreas that no one would have dreamed of seeing 40 years ago, when ""Earthquake"" (with its tacky, plaster-cracking “Sensurround”) represented the state of the art. But nothing means anything. The spectacle feels less earned than Dwayne Johnson’s biceps, which are ludicrous but not hollow."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"Between its steroidic CGI and emotionally vacant plot line, the movie is all flex, no muscle."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,It's an orgy for disaster porn devotees.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"Considered as pure spectacle, San Andreas is gripping and effective."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,The cringeworthy dialogue and unmoving earnestness are the biggest disasters in this mostly forgettable action flick.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"The dialogue in San Andreas is lame, its plot both predictable and implausible, and the character development beside the point. Even Dwayne Johnson, that force of cinematic nature and rock-ribbed charisma, doesn’t have enough charm to dig this mess of a movie out of the rubble of cliche it’s buried in."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"San Andreas doesn’t have much interest in the lives lost during its sequence of catastrophes, but it does dole out plenty of the large-scale spectacle that matters in disaster films of this type."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,"Handsomely shot by Steve Yedlin, Rian Johnson’s regular cinematographer, and boasting a typically likable Dwayne Johnson as its star, San Andreas nonetheless struggles to drum up tension or interest, even as skyscrapers topple like Jenga towers and massive tidal waves sweep through San Francisco Bay."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,50,The movie is at its strongest when it integrates family dynamics into the plot rather than indulging in extreme couples therapy.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"Even by the non-Olympian standards of the disaster genre, San Andreas is chock-full of cliché characters, staggering coincidences and wild improbabilities."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"Campy but never campy enough and far too numbingly artificial to ever drum up any real suspense or sense of awe, the film has a scale that's squandered on visual witlessness."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"San Andreas' whirlwind of action and devotion to the disaster movie playbook will satisfy those looking for a loud, effects-filled ride. Those inspecting it any closer will find a cookie cutter studio blockbuster which stretches disbelief to its limits."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,The very earnest human drama fits awkwardly into the action and isn’t helped by some unconvincing performances and weak dialogue.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"After providing some blissfully stupid B-movie thrills for its first hour, the film suffers from spectacle overkill."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,The cast’s likeable work falls right through the script holes.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,40,"If you crave Emmerich-esque disaster-porn with a mega body count, there’s plenty here to OMG at. But when it comes to character depth or plotting, San Andreas is a sadly familiar wasteland."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,38,"There's nothing to keep the pulse alive after the first quake. Peyton throws in a second quake and a tsunami, but after a while buildings tumbling into the ocean are just a bunch of pixels turning everything into visual mush and leaving audiences in a digital stupor."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,38,"In Brad Peyton's San Andreas, the biggest earthquake in recorded history is less natural disaster than divorce negotiation process."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,38,"Oblivious to both narrative logic and the laws of physics, the cliché-filled San Andreas doesn’t nearly have the star power of earlier, better disaster movies it borrows from like “The Poseidon Adventure,” “Earthquake” and “The Towering Inferno.”"
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,33,It’s hard to stay connected to a disaster film where the biggest disaster is the script.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,San Andreas changes all too quickly from satisfyingly foolish to dismayingly dumb to genuinely stupid.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,"The purpose of San Andreas is not to make us think, but to make us gape, to pummel us with effect and effect until we finally give in. Fair enough. Uncle. I need a Tylenol anyway."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,The most disturbing thing about this may be how dull and routine it seems. Computer-generated imagery can produce remarkably detailed vistas of disaster — bridges and buildings collapsing; giant ships flung onto urban streets; beloved landmarks pulverized — but the technology also has a way of stripping such spectacles of impact and interest.
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,30,"San Andreas can't wait for the carnage. The problem is, it's too chicken to ask us to comprehend it. It's all big, distant, unfathomable wreckage -- all shattering skyscrapers and rippling cityscapes -- with no sense of the human cost."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,25,Run! Run for your lives! Get out of this theater now! Two hours is a terrible thing to waste!
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,25,"This is pure Disaster 101 formula, although distilled to the minimum amount of dialogue and characters possible."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,20,"San Andreas is a disaster — literally. That’s not to take a piece out of Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson. His charm and family-man-style fearlessness as the movie’s star is the only saving grace in this thuddingly repetitive, badly written crash-a-thon."
San Andreas,6.1,155190832,20,"San Andreas, by its very nature, begs, borrows, and outright steals from other, occasionally better, disaster epics."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,70,"As effective and fat-free as its sinewy star, Luke Evans, Dracula Untold proves an absorbing, swiftly comprehensive origin tale."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,70,"Dracula Untold is a dumb, lowest-common-denominator kind of movie, but it’s a surprisingly entertaining one. It’s brisk, which counts for a lot in this overbaked genre. The action is directed with verve and imagination — and it’s all gorgeously bleak, with black clouds of bats whipping around remote, craggy castles beneath portentous Carpathian skies."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,63,"Dracula Untold is a movie that gives good trailer. That's not surprising because it's a visually arresting saga. Unfortunately, the story in the final, full version is thicker than blood."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,63,"The good news barely outweighs the bad in Dracula Untold, a lightweight war-adventure that is ultimately stranger and more enticing when it remembers it's also a horror film."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,63,"Vlad’s numerous speeches about love, honor and family grow tedious, along with the film’s wooden dialogue in general. And it quickly becomes obvious that Dracula Untold is more interested in being cool than making sense."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,60,"If they had to give Drac an “origin story” this literal-minded, at least they had the sense to keep it keen and lively, whittled to a point."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,58,"He's a romantic and a psychopath and creature of the night. Sadly, Dracula Untold, with its humorless aura and been-there-done-that feel, doesn't allow Evans to inhabit many of these aspects. Instead, Dracula Untold feels largely uninspired."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,At times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stoker's legacy.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"Instead of being respectful of Bram Stoker's creation, it attempts to remake him as a tragic figure with superhero powers."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"No campy vampire movie, and the early part of the film is well-made enough that the sadness of Vlad’s dilemma is truly felt."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"More sad dad and noble martyr than creature of the night, Evans’ dashing Prince Of Darkness inspires less fear than just about any incarnation of the famous character, save perhaps the one played by Leslie Nielsen."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,It works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,50,"Charles Dance is the Nosferatu-garbed monster in the cave, a balding, toothy villain in the great tradition of British vampires — Christopher Lee, Gary Oldman, Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale among them. The moment he shows up, all shadowy menace and prophecy, “Dracula” gets interesting."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"For about the first hour of its running time, Dracula Untold is far too restrained and tasteful, and it certainly suffers from its tediously noble hero; it's well made but fatally lacking in thrills or excitement."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"Aside from Dance and some hazy views of impaled bodies, the film is low on shock and gore. It's aiming more for sweeping historical epic, but it doesn't work on either level."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,Looking for plausibility in a movie called Dracula Untold is as pointless as looking for humor or personality in Mr. Evans’s dour performance.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"The CGI — mostly Evans transforming into fightin’ bats — look muddy and cheap, but the weapons, Turkish helmets and Romanian interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this “Lord of the Rings” wanna-be were at the same level."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"Too much of the last hour is a muddle of unconvincing, hard-to-read nighttime action scenes."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"It’s no-frills, B-movie modesty might have been winning, if it weren’t so dashed-off."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,40,"Armour-clanging, cloak-swishing tosh with okay battles, terrible dialogue and sadly little horror or heroism. Nowhere near as bad as I, Frankenstein – but what is?"
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,38,This toothless attempt is just dead on arrival.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,38,"The origins story Dracula Untold is Dracula unbold — unoriginal, unimaginative and utterly non-unprecedented. This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,37,The film isn’t awful. There are moments of handsome cinematography and occasional effects that both frighten and impress.
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Dracula Untold boldly attempts to retell the Dracula origin story by sinking its teeth into Bram Stoker’s novel and draining it of all the passion, sensuality, and ambience that have seduced readers and moviegoers since the turn of the 20th century."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Another addition to Universal’s Pictures Classic Monsters arsenal of crap (remember Van Helsing?), director Shore, in his feature debut, displays a fine sense of pacing but little else."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Much like the recent, widely reviled I, Frankenstein, this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,30,"Dracula Untold opts for the stately, staid approach, and even at a mere 85 minutes (sans credits) it’s something of a bore — neither scary nor romantic nor exciting in any of the ways it seems to intend."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,25,"If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself — and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes — then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?"
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,25,"It's a story arc that wouldn't be out of place on Game of Thrones, except it lacks for the HBO program's dense and surprising dramatic reflexes."
Dracula Untold,6.3,56280355,20,"Drab, silly and mind-numbing, this Dracula is strictly for the suckers."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,70,"An action figure with a sweet core, Johnson can pump up the humanity of any franchise, whether he’s playing a stepdad who becomes a hero in Journey 2 or, as here, a stud soldier who treats Flint and Jaye like his grown children and shepherds them through peril. Following those younger Joes, the Retaliation audience is encouraged to clamber up on Johnson’s huge soldiers and go along for a pretty cool ride."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,70,It's not enough to call this the rare franchise action movie to bring the goods; it's the even rarer one whose creators seem to understand what the goods even are.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,70,"So fetishistic about high-powered weapons that it qualifies as an NRA wet dream, G.I. Joe: Retaliation pretty accurately reflects the franchise's comic book and cartoon origins, which is both a good and a bad thing: good if you're a 12- to 15-year-old boy, bad if you're just about anyone else."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,67,It's well-executed technocratic action fluff. But it did leave me buzzed rather than drained.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,67,"Retaliation is no masterpiece, but it’s a movie whose fun doesn’t feel like a four-letter word -- popcorn entertainment that not only rivals what you see during summer, but surpasses what you see from Sommers."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,63,"A more sure-footed shoot-'em-up that finds some heart, wit and perhaps enough momentum to spawn a formidable action franchise."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,63,Willis is at his relaxed best this time.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"As long as Hollywood keeps hitting us over the head with empty spectacles like G.I. Joe: Retaliation, regular Joes will be too numb to fight back."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"The directive behind this sequel, clearly, was non-stop action. Let's think about that phrase a second. Do we really want our action movies to deliver action that does not stop? Ever? I get a little tired of action sequences that won't stop."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"Dumb fun can be, well, fun. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is way too much of the former and not nearly enough of the latter."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"At times, G.I. Joe: Retaliation has a sense of its own ridiculousness — Pryce seems to be having a good time, anyway — but not enough to soften the mass death, hardware fetishism, and militaristic zeal that gets in the way of its escapist fun."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"Offering a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor, G.I. Joe: Retaliation might well have been titled “G.I. Joe: Regurgitation,” advertising big guns, visual effects and that other line of Hasbro toys with the same joyless, chew-everything-up-and-spit-it-out efficiency."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"Instead of long takes, which are lovingly utilized in Step Up 3D, Jon M. Chu opts for increasing volatility in the editing room."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,50,"It’s a live-action version of on an ’80s cartoon that was designed to sell toys. This is “Transformers” without the Bumblebee Camaro, a lot of action, a few one-liners, and a lot of gunplay."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"If you currently own a G.I. Joe toy or if you've dressed like a ninja at least twice since Halloween, you're going to find a lot to ""hooah"" about in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation."""
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,Plays like a tiresomely extended evening of channel surfing.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"That G.I. Joe silliness the first film embraced has been steamrolled into tentpole flatness this time around. It’s not stoopid anymore, but just plain stupid."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"The G.I. Joe team is back, and most of their sophomore movie adventure, G.I. Joe Retaliation, is as bland as their name and as subtle as an exploding tank."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"It's massive, all the retaliation and the world saving stuff. And it's convoluted. Frankly no one should have to think that hard to keep up with the Joes."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"Fast Five was a good example of how applying The Rock to a tired series could bring it back to life. G.I. Joe, by opting for self-seriousness instead of knowing daftness, has squandered its secret weapon."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,40,"“Rock solid,” is Bruce Willis’ nod-wink appraisal of an attack strategy in G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The film’s nowhere near as sturdy, trundling out middling action and nonsensical plotting."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,"Feels like a five-year-old with a megaphone, excitedly yelling about his latest bulldozer-soldier-dinosaur smash-kill-squash-everything game."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,"How funny that Pryce, a tweedy Brit playing a bad guy, should be the one person doing anything remotely heroic for this dud."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,"The dialogue and exposition scenes in G.I. Joe are like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon from the 1980s, but the PG-13 violence is a little intense for the 7-year-old boys (and girls) who might love this stuff."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,38,Everything in G.I. Joe: Retaliation is perfunctory - technically proficient but soulless. It's not exciting. It's boring.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,37,"Although “G.I. Joe” is merely a movie based on Hasbro toys, the action -- the real point of all this -- feels just as lifeless."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,30,"There actually is some clever dialogue in the film, especially early on between Roadblock and Duke (Tatum). But this fades over the course of the film, and too much of what the characters say sounds as though it’s been lifted verbatim from 1930s and 1940s serials."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,30,"The film’s director, Jon M. Chu, executes a pretty good high-altitude fight scene. Still, there should be a “Fans Only” sign at the door of every theater."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,30,I won't pretend that I had a great time watching G.I. Joe: Retaliation.
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,25,"This movie never realizes how ridiculous anything it does truly is, right up to the last-second promise of another sequel."
G.I. Joe: Retaliation,5.8,122523060,25,"What's the difference between an action figure and an action star? Very little in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which features no performances of note, even from such combat-tested thespians as Bruce Willis, Jonathan Pryce and Dwayne Johnson."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,80,"Shooter is a generically titled studio action picture that turns out to be a surprisingly deft satire about Americans' loss of faith in their government following the 2000 election, the 9/11 attacks, and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Shooter does what any good thriller should accomplish - it thrills. It's fast-paced, energetic, and doesn't follow a path that seems pre-ordained from the beginning."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Wahlberg acquits himself well, and the supporting cast -- which includes pioneering rocker Levon Helm in a scene-stealing cameo as an aging gun buff who knows a thing or two about cover-ups, Ned Beatty as a corrupt politician, and a Strangelovian Rade Serbedzija -- is so strong you almost wish the film were longer so they could have more screen time."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"The movie's politics may miss their mark, but its thrills are dead-on."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,75,"Unravels a bit heading toward its finale, as buildings explode and characters are forced to explain themselves and their nefarious motives. But the payoff at the end - at once kind of radical and gratuitous - delivers a wallop."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"It's a story that can be transplanted from genre to genre, because we never grow tired of it, which is to say that it fits snugly into the paranoid drift of American movies, and the value we place on one honest man with a gun."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"If the movie only lavished as much thought and care on its characters as it does on each intricate set piece, Shooter might have been a classic."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"Carrying Shooter through its difficulties is, finally, not its crisp action sequences and definitely not the torture. It's Wahlberg's performance, which is the film's most old-fashioned element, and its best."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"This maximalist approach can tax the nerves, though it has the benefit of keeping you on alert. It’s also pretty enjoyable. Mr. Fuqua, who happens to be surprisingly good with actors, does have a knack for chaos."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,70,"Wahlberg could be the actor that action movies have been looking for since Sly, Arnold, Harrison, Bruce, Jackie and Jean-Claude -- all in their 50s or 60s -- got too old to execute the leg lifts necessary to kick bad guys in the butt."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,67,"The timing couldn't be better for a thriller that focuses on assassination, international war scandals and U.S. agencies of enormous influence and wildly varying competence."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"Suspended over a deep gully of disbelief, where logic takes more bullets than the bad guys, Shooter still makes the grade as hard-ass action escapism."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"It does move along at a nice clip, and delivers exactly what belligerent action fans on both sides of the political aisle want -- a wholly admirable figure blowing up a lot of bad s---."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"The paranoia is as thick and luscious as that Reddi-wip, and it's served from both left and right."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,A stylish but essentially businesslike smash-and-crasher.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,63,"Like most modern action films, Shooter is too explicit, more interested in mayhem than motive."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,60,"An immediately involving yarn of an ace Marine sharpshooter set up to take the fall for an attempted presidential assassination, picture saddles itself with stereotypical villains, hokey contrivances and too-expedient crisis solutions."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,60,The picture might be entertaining if it didn't take itself so seriously.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,58,"The film has about five endings, each sillier than the next. Before it's over, the business end of that sniper rifle looks kind of inviting."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"A screwy assassination thriller for these murky times, it takes half its pages from Soldier of Fortune and the other half from links provided by conspiracytheories-zapoppin.org."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Despite gripping chase sequences and a few awe-inspiring fiery explosions, gaping holes in the convoluted plot make Shooter heavier on style than substance."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"The story is often ridiculous, but director Antoine Fuqua provides plenty of fun distractions."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Starts out OK, but then almost seems to be intentionally going for humor."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"If this were a more serious film, its cynicism about the U.S. government would put it in a league with ""The Manchurian Candidate."" But it is simply an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick with bantamweight Wahlberg doing the heavy lifting for the preoccupied Governator."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"An intermittently preposterous, drawn-out but sometimes entertaining story about an unstoppable ex-Marine."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"Though much of the action in Shooter is beautifully photographed, the movie's force is as a blunt instrument of metaphor. Shooter is a video-game-fantasy version of the 2006 midterm elections, a howl of rage at the hypocrisy of the Bush presidency and the Iraq war."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,"This is the first big-studio action picture with some of the disgusted, bloody nihilism of the post-Vietnam era."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,50,A virtual textbook of action clichés.
Double Target,7.2,47003582,42,"The ultimate crime of this paranoid enemy-of-the-state pulp, directed with more style than brains by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), is how dull it is."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,42,"Fuqua keeps the action moving efficiently, but he doesn't know when to stop piling it on, and eventually, Wahlberg's army of one becomes more a comic-book vigilante than a righteously disgruntled patriot."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,40,"Sylvester Stallone is filming a new episode of his ""Rambo"" action series, but Mark Wahlberg has beaten him to the punch with Shooter, a preposterous gut buster that follows the formula so closely it would probably lose a plagiarism suit."
Double Target,7.2,47003582,25,"Less subversive and infinitely less intelligent than 1999’s Wahlberg-starrer ""Three Kings,"" this movie does blow lots of s--- up real good and punish contemptible public figures otherwise left unaccountable for massacring African villagers."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,75,So chalk Escape Plan up as a pretty good action movie given an extra edge by the intelligent use of its two main actors.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,75,"Though this movie can’t match the formal qualities that made the pair’s most iconic films work, it goes a long way toward recapturing their sense of cheesy fun."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,70,"With its fun script and cheap visuals, Escape Plan evokes the halfwit cheesiness of 1980s-era Cannon films, but it also recalls the deft pacing and legibility of their action sequences."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,70,"Here are two action stars having fun; watching them work together as a team is a lot more entertaining than you might have expected. Try not to think too hard about it, and Escape Plan is stupid, stupid fun."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,68,A Stallone / Schwarzenegger film that isn't completely beneath them.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,67,"Escape Plan is so dumb it's adorable, as any movie pitting Sylvester Stallone's grunt against Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent should be."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,A display of old-school muscle-buddy connivance that’s as flatly preposterous as it is shamelessly entertaining.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,The heist-inspired elements aren't well thought through and it becomes a question of which is harder to swallow: the mechanics of the story or the idea that a couple of sixtysomethings can kick this much ass.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,Stupid but fun.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,63,Any prison-break yarn that includes Arnold Schwarzenegger delivering the line “You hit like a vegetarian” is OK by me.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"The script never gives them the kind of memorable exchange that makes fans howl with delight. But all in all, Escape Plan does what it sets out to do."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Escape Plan is mostly a gray, thudding metal machine of throwback exploitation, but the goateed, goofy Ah-nold is so happy to be in the thick of an old-school bruiser again that he makes it feel like the dumb-fun flashback party it is."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"No new ground is broken, and viewers will, not unpleasantly, get everything they expect. It’s apparently morning in America again."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"As the unpredictable, mischievous inmate with the unlikely name of Emil Rottmayer, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s sidekick role in Escape Plan may make audiences weep for the films we missed out on while he made speeches in Sacramento."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Stallone and Schwarzenegger have all the gravity here, and keep pulling Escape Plan in the direction of an old-fashioned tough-guy action film, one filled with nods to their onscreen pasts and offscreen exploits."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"Mercifully free of tongue-in-cheek meta-humor, Escape Plan is a likably lunkheaded meat-and-potatoes brawler that never pretends to be more sophisticated than it is."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,60,"A highly enjoyable slice of in-one-eye, out-the-other nonsense. It may coast on the charisma of its leads at times, and it’s hardly deep, but there’s a Friday night to be had."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Schwarzenegger, for one, seems to be having a hoot."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"The plot itself is predictably divorced from reality, containing more holes — and smelling staler — than month-old Swiss cheese.  All of which means that Stallone and Schwarzenegger end up having to do all the heavy lifting."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Sure, it’s fun to see the Governator and the Italian Stallion he-manning it up together feature-length for the first time — the screen is barely big enough to contain the two of them — but the prison-break movie Escape Plan is unworthy of the momentous occasion."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"Action fans -- particularly devotees of brainless '80s shoot-em-ups -- may find enough to like here, particularly the preposterous mayhem of the third act."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"In one amusing bit of dialogue, Stallone and Schwarze-negger kid each other about being smarter than they look. For a little while at least, we thought we might be able to say the same about Escape Plan."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,50,"The tempered violence, the nature of the villains, the easy bonhomie of our leads and a cast peppered with great supporting players make Escape Plan go down easier than the other “Rambo/Last Man Standing/Expendables” pictures that brought these two aged action stars back from the dead."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"It won't stick to your ribs in the way, say, a shank will -- but it probably won't leave you looking for a way to escape the theater, either."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,It’s not fair to either of these actors to want to see Rocky and the Terminator over and over again. But it is fair to want to see them in something better than this.
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"With a tighter plot and slightly more knowing craftsmanship, this might have worked, but Swedish director Mikael Hafström (1408, The Rite) isn’t really the man to poke fun with any sophistication at his stars’ well-established personas."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"Escape Pla’ would have made a perfect vehicle for, say, a Chuck Norris or even a Jean-Claude Van Damme. But these two redoubtable, enormously watchable old-school heroes deserve better."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,40,"For a long stretch of the second act the film feels like doing a long stretch, but Schwarzenegger’s having a ball as Stallone goes through the motions."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,38,"Yeah, it's a mishmash of good, strange ideas and generic nonsense, barely held together by Sly and Arnie."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,33,"Escape Plan deserves some credit for gradually rising from abysmal to almost-mediocre, though it’s needlessly complicated in every step of the way."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,30,"The film is eventful and full of suspense, but also obvious and completely contrived."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,30,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a good thing, too."
Escape Plan,6.7,25132228,25,"A dim anti-privatization parable that preaches a familiar strain of cynical, unchallenged self-righteousness in the face of widespread abuse of civil liberties."
Alien,6.4,55473600,91,"Alien3 is a grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller, with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on."
Alien,6.4,55473600,88,"If Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) had more surprises and James Cameron's Aliens (1986) more thrills, David Fincher's austere, low-tech, darkly funny Alien 3 has more sharply observed characters."
Alien,6.4,55473600,88,"Alien 3 belongs to that branch of fantasy comics, best exemplified by the ""Road Warrior"" movies, in which the iron and space ages meet for dizzy results."
Alien,6.4,55473600,80,"Ironically, Alien is not a bad movie. In fact -- here's the rub -- it's too interesting to make an exciting summer flick."
Alien,6.4,55473600,75,"Fincher's camerawork gives the movie a jittery feel, and his video-trained eye lends the prison sets the look of a dilapidated cathedral, but again, there's really nothing here that we haven't seen before, and better, at that. Nice title, though."
Alien,6.4,55473600,75,A muddled effort that offers little more than visual splendor to recommend it.
Alien,6.4,55473600,75,"Although Alien 3 is stylish--and ambitious--the movie doesn't have the soul or guts to sustain that ambition. It gets swallowed up in its own technology and genre expectations. And Fincher gets stalled in the drama, trapped in too many scenes of talking heads looming out of the gloom."
Alien,6.4,55473600,67,"Alien 3 is, simply put, a mess. The writers have no idea how to tell a coherent, entertaining story. With the exception of a surprise or two, there isn't much worthwhile here."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,100,"The film's immense cast and crew, headed by director Michael Bay, writer Randall Wallace and stars Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, blend artistry and technology to create a blockbuster entertainment that has passion, valor and tremendous action."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,It expertly capitalizes on the emotional associations Americans have with Pearl Harbor and renders the battle scenes with an excellence that goes beyond proficiency and into the realm of art.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,"The cast is engaging, the overall visual effects are tremendous and I found myself fairly swept away for most of the fast-moving, three-hour running time."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,75,"Until a disappointing tailspin in the last hour, Pearl Harbor is the best piece of popular entertainment to come along in years."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,"Ninety minutes into this massive movie the attack commences, and the spectacular images come hurtling like fireballs. This is, let's be honest, what we're here for, and what most Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movies serve up best: the poetry of destruction."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,Parts of this three-hour World War II epic are brilliant -- especially the 40-minute sequence in which the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is stunningly re-created.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,70,"The picture is nearly painstaking in its traditionalism, a tale of love, war, and valor in which nostalgia for ''simpler times'' gets mashed together, almost fetishistically, with nostalgia for old movies and for the spirit of knightly self sacrifice during World War II."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,67,A movie meant to explode off the screen -- and it's at its best when those explosions are going full blast.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,63,"It's war porn, a movie that revels in the carnage."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,60,"Works best as a bang-and- boom action picture, a loud symphony of bombardment and explosion juiced up with frantic editing and shiny computer-generated imagery."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,60,"It's a Ritalin-deprived sensibility, but it keeps you skating over the dull spots, in which the film unfortunately is rich."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"A crowd-pleasing blockbuster if ever there was one, features as its centerpiece a jaw-droppingly vivid re-creation of the Japanese attack on the U.S.'s fabled (and extremely vulnerable, as it turned out) Pacific fleet."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"""Pearl Harbor"" is exactly the kind of prestige project you'd expect from a director like Bay, hitting all its targets with plodding precision and never once achieving surprise."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"Clearly, neither screenwriter Randall Wallace nor director Michael Bay ever met a cliche he didn't embrace."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"For all its agonizing true-life trappings, has the staying power of a grand-scale video game. Manhattan's sushi bars are in no danger of going dark."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,The filmmakers would have been better advised to stick with the Zeroes and spend less time making up heroes.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"The 2,400 Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor deserve a nobler memorial than this sentimental hogwash that reduces heroism to ""Top Gun"" antics and pretty cinematography."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"Unfortunately, the bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,It's an extravaganza worth seeing once -- and maybe later on DVD.
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"If you decide to hit the concessions stand (where you're bound to have lots of company), I'd suggest going out for popcorn during either the first hour or the third, because the second features some pretty good big-screen effects involving planes, ships, and explosions."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"The chaos is convincing, but, less ruthless than Steven Spielberg, Bay eschews D-day panic and mutilation."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,50,"A Michael Bay movie: bang bang, paper-thin characters, wooden screenplay."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"I found ""Pearl Harbor"" annoying but not excruciating—even at three hours, it's less assaultive than either ""The Mummy Returns"" or ""Moulin Rouge."""
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"The film has no soul. An epic about this day of infamy should shake you to the core. But the real infamy about Pearl Harbor is that when you exit, you don't feel a thing."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Perhaps they should have called this ""Bore-a, Bore-a, Bore-a."""
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,"Just compare their superficiality to the complex characters in ""From Here to Eternity"" and what's missing here becomes terribly clear."
Pearl Harbor,6.1,198542554,40,Fiction and fantasy to evade reflection on the world we actually live in.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,90,"As is common in a Frankenheimer picture, the plot lines get a bit tangled in Ronin, but the atmosphere is tense, the style impeccable."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,90,Ronin can be watched as appreciatively for its hard-boiled performances as for its visceral excitement.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,90,It's a welcome throwback to the days when the world didn't have to end or tanker trucks explode to get an action audience's attention.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,88,"Ronin manages to remain focused on the plot and the characters, even while staging increasingly complicated pyrotechnic set pieces and offering its share of white-knuckle moments."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,88,Ronin represents an exhilarating return to form for Frankenheimer.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,88,"What an impeccably crafted film this is -- slightly impoverished in theme, perhaps, but so rich everywhere else that it seems rude to notice."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,80,"A pleasurable throwback to the sort of gritty, low-tech international thriller that was a staple of the 1960s."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,75,I enjoyed the film on two levels: for its skill and its silliness.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,75,"Frankenheimer doesn't recapture the magic he once created in movies like ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" but he does cook up an effective thriller in the ""French Connection"" vein."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,70,"A film in which the mechanics of the plot are far less interesting, and vital, then the interior landscape of men who exist outside the law."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,70,Here's a strangely flawed and strangely satisfying movie.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,70,"After a while, you stop counting the chases -- they just get longer and louder, and it's like watching the revival of a forgotten art form; the fact that it's done with a minimum of special effects makes it all the more stirring."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,67,"It remains head and shoulders above what little competition there is by virtue of its stellar casting, editing, and above all, Frankenheimer's fluid, explosive direction."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,67,It's not just the crack stunt driving that makes Ronin such a welcome throwback; it's also the existential hardness of this thriller's motley band of mercenaries.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,60,"Frankenheimer pretty much ignores everything that's happened in the action and thriller genres since 1975, and mostly that's a good thing."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,60,"Ronin is well-made, but it's an act of connoisseurship for people who have given up on movies as an art form."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,60,"Unlike the ronin, the heroes of a Japanese legend, these guys are still searching for a story."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,"Although laced with adrenaline and flavored with noirish seasoning, John Frankenheimer's Ronin is a disappointingly conventional thriller."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,"Ronin eventually becomes tiresome, but the pairing of De Niro and Reno never gets old."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,The concept is intriguing and the car chases are pure adrenaline.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,"It has a gritty feel and a tight, methodical, one-thing-after-another tempo."
Ronin,7.3,41616262,50,Ronin shows the mark of a veteran hand and is entertaining in fits and starts.
Ronin,7.3,41616262,40,Not even supercool Robert De Niro can enliven this boring tale about a team of mercenary operatives.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,75,An impossibly enjoyable live-action cartoon that plays on our real-life anxieties about vengeful cadres of foreign radicals blowing up people - and places.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,67,"Brash, brutal, and simplistic in equal measure, it’s a retrograde work that, for better and worse, delivers its old-school mayhem with punishing precision and unrepentant glee."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,63,"The film is a popcorn-crowd pleaser, but a “yippee ki-yay” or two away from something more memorable."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,63,"As action-thrillers go, this one provides what the previews tease. Maybe that’s enough for an evening’s mindless, throw-away entertainment, but I can’t help but be disappointed that the filmmakers couldn’t have brought something more inventive to a genre that too often relies on worn-out tropes."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,60,"While not nearly as elaborate, nor as visually sophisticated as the last Mission: Impossible outing or the most recent Bonds, London Has Fallen is actually more plausible at its core, if not in its details, which is partly why it succeeds in laying claim to an audience's attention for the entirety of its swift running time."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,60,It’s all so overly macho that it plays like a camp pleasure-cruise.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,50,The action is pumped up. The destruction is extreme. The whole thing is absurd.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,50,"Like its predecessor, the film is content to dumbly relish in the inanity of Mike's rampage."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,42,"The new sequel, London Has Fallen, implausibly ups its predecessor’s stakes to ""Die Hard in the City of London."" Unfortunately, widening the scope this dramatically causes the entire fragile action-movie axis to spin wildly out of control."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"Najafi's R-rated London Has Fallen doesn't target the genteel viewer. Rather, it aims squarely for moviegoers who like their action bloody, their fights brutal, their body count sky-high."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,Remember “Olympus Has Fallen”? This one is worse.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"It's all silly and meant to be fun, except when Najafi tries to throw in some serious bits, which wind up being sillier still."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"Bloodthirsty, derivative and xenophobic nonsense."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,It’s a film that doesn’t so much invite you to switch off your brain as take it out and dump it in the nearest popcorn box.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,"Creepy “send them back to Fuckheadistan” sentiment overwhelms London Has Fallen’s guilty pleasures, its meaty violence and xenophobic nastiness giving the cheddar an unpleasant aftertaste."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,40,There is some surreal fun at the beginning as everything collapses.... But then it’s the same thing over again.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,38,It’s difficult to imagine anyone appearing in this film thought of it as more than a payday.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,38,"There’s little drama, but the fights and chases (Butler hanging out of a moving SUV) are exciting, if not very original."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,38,"The film, with its wearying gamer-style rounds of death, is routine at best."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,35,"Iranian-born director Babak Najafi (“Sebbe”) and the four credited screenwriters... make things move fast enough to keep you awake, but not fast enough to finesse its plot absurdities past an alert viewer’s mind."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,30,"As long as there are enemies in Islamic lands, we'll probably have to endure risible time-wasters like London Has Fallen, designed to justify blinkered foreign policy attitudes and stoke jokey hatred."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,30,"The action never stops once the first car bomb is triggered, but the second half of London Has Fallen takes place mostly in the dark, where nobody can see the budget."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,30,"For all the slicing and dicing of the editing, narrative momentum grinds to a trudge after the synthetic spectacle of the capital’s undoing."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,No characterization. A plot you could write on a single sheet of toilet paper. Sadistic violence we’re meant to cheer. A surprise that wouldn’t fool anyone who left the theater after the opening credits and came back for the last 10 minutes.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"For the sequel, London Has Fallen, Butler and director Babak Najafi (HBO’s “Banshee”) strike a tone that’s more consistent — consistently dumb."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"London Has Fallen is terrorism porn, an alarmist, jingoistic piece of CGI-soaked garbage that implores its audience to fear nothing after sensationalizing the slaughter of innocents and the destruction of a major city."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"When viewing the action thriller London Has Fallen, there’s no escaping the reality that you’ve seen everything on the screen before — many, many times. For every bullet, and you will lose count, there is a cliche."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,25,"The special effects are worse than I thought modern studio filmmaking allowed for. Actors such as Robert Forster and Melissa Leo reprise their roles from the first film with maybe half-a-dozen lines apiece. Were it not for the presence of said actors, this could easily pass for a DTV spin-off."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,20,"Will this hard-luck president again defy death while his stoic sidekick vanquishes the nasty, uncivilized terrorists? It’s hard to care when a movie is this formulaic and moronic."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,12,London Has Fallen is remarkable only because of how much worse it is than its inane predecessor.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,12,A horrible and wildly unnecessary follow-up that might actually be worse than its predecessor.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,11,"Perhaps these are dark times, both onscreen and off, but even if they are not, London Has Fallen is an hour-and-a-half of viciously Us vs. Them, Trump-style bad filmmaking on all known levels."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,0,Make American movies great again. You can start by boycotting this one.
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,0,"Racist, stupid and boasting cheesy effects."
London Has Fallen,5.9,62678608,0,Perhaps the movie’s politics—which range from tone deaf to irredeemable—would be more of an issue if it weren’t so inept.
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"The film looks and feels good, and Washington's performance is the more uncanny the more we think back over it. The ending is ""flawed,"" as we critics like to say, but it's so magnificently, shamelessly, implausibly flawed that (a) it breaks apart from the movie and has a life of its own, or (b) at least it avoids being predictable."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"The Book of Eli works, even if the preservation of Christianity isn’t high on your personal post-apocalypse bucket list. Establishing its storytelling rules clearly and well, the film simply is better, and better-acted, than the average end-of-the-world fairy tale."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"Washington is surprisingly persuasive as a world-weary blade-wielder, and Oldman makes the most of a not particularly interesting villain. But the film's breakout star may be Kunis, who brings to Solara a blend of sassiness and sexiness that's reminiscent of Michelle Pfeiffer."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"Though not as lyrical as ""The Road,"" which benefits from both its visual artistry and its humanist perspective, The Book of Eli employs the genre conventions of the western to make mythic its principal character."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,75,"Its hero may be on a mission from above, but in a refreshing twist, the fate of mankind rests with the literate."

The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,70,"Its over-the-top violence is cartoonish at times, menacing at others - which is a good thing. And truly, if one must wander a barren, post-apocalyptic landscape with somebody, who better to wander with than Denzel Washington?"
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,70,"The sepia-toned palette gets a little wearying, but the dialogue is hilarious, the violence is crunchy, and cameos by Tom Waits and topflight Brit character actor Michael Gambon are worth the ticket price alone."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,70,"The Book of Eli takes the violent, gritty feel of a spaghetti western, marries it with elements of ""The Road,"" places it in the future and gives it a spiritual twist."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,67,"Washington doesn’t look as if he’s having much fun, and who can blame him? Perhaps he agrees with me: Apocalypse movies, like apocalypse heroes, need some laughs, too."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,67,"Much has been made of the film's ending, vis-à-vis whether or not it's a pro- or anti-organized religion commentary of some sort. The Hughes Brothers, for two, say they just wanted to make a kickass piece of contemporary entertainment, and I, for one, believe them."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,The problem with The Book of Eli is that the narrative isn't a match for its sentiments. The script feels like it's an iteration or two short of a final draft.
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,"The Book of Eli isn't as exciting or funny or inspiring as it wants and needs to be, and its preachy ending is an ordeal. But Washington, a movie star who can act, is one cool dude who is worth following anywhere."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,"A hyper-violent, post-apocalyptic Western in the mold of ""Mad Max"" that can't make up its mind whether it wants to be corny or misanthropic."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,63,"The film’s cool-looking desaturated look (not unlike “The Road”), plentiful action and Washington’s charismatic gravitas as the taciturn hero make it relatively easy to overlook the pretensions and implausibilities in the script."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,60,"The Hughes Brothers' measured, well-paced direction complements the comic-book simplicity of this narrative."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,60,The movie keeps you watching and generally engaged.
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,60,"Somewhat entertaining, in its own little mud-brown way."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,58,"This makes ""Eli"" sort of wonderfully silly toward the end, as if the Hughes brothers set out to make the first-ever faith-based ""Mad Max"" movie."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"Some mordant comic touches would have been welcome throughout the picture, which has a somber tone that suffers a bit from lack of modulation and nuance."

The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"The Book of Eli is “The Road’’ with twice the plot, four times the ammunition, and half the brains; it’ll probably make 10 times the money."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"Yet it all comes down to one simplistic idea, and the result feels like a one-film evangelical movement."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"The story requires a greater leap of faith than I was willing or able to muster, since Eli is also a saintly pilgrim on a God-given mission to save a ruined world."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"So we're back on ""The Road ,"" but this time Eli's coming – better hide your heart and, while you're at it, put your brain on hold, the easier to enjoy the action-filled sermon to come."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,50,"Starts out strong and boasts a convincing picture of the post-war world as an anarchic desert. But it comes to ditch its fun stylization for vague themes of religiosity and morality, leaving you with a disappointingly muddled movie."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,40,"For a few brief moments, the film becomes something close to Greek mythology, as opposed to graphic-novel imitator. What a feeling!"
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,40,"Mad Max 2 with Thought for the Day thrown in. There’s some ace post-holocaust action, but you can’t help feel you were invited to a party with fizzy pop and cream cake and got suckered into a sermon instead."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,38,"A didactic and humorless Western, Eli is too laborious for an action film and too brutal to be an inspirational tale."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,25,"A ponderous dystopian bummer that might be described as ""The Road Warrior"" without car chases, or ""The Road"" without humanity."
The Book of Eli,6.9,94835059,25,"There is also a last-minute ""Sixth Sense"" twist, although it definitely won't make you sit through the movie again to see if the filmmakers cheated."

The Expendables,6.5,103068524,75,Expendables is the closest thing to movie Viagra yet invented. It's reprehensible. It's stoopid violent. It's a lot of unholy fun.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,75,"The way that Stallone directs, though, every machete thrust and relentless round of bullet spray is staged with a certain undeniable...conviction."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,75,"Delivers pretty much exactly what its audience wants and expects: big, dumb, campy fun so deliriously, comically macho, it's remarkable that no one in the cast died of testosterone poisoning."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,70,"An effective mix of lean and over-the-top, The Expendables is often preposterous, but it achieves the immediacy of a graphic novel without the overdone mythology."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,70,"The three icons ham it up, do some verbal towel-snapping and have fun, which also describes most of this self-conscious adventure movie."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,63,A super-stoked action thriller
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"A who's who of classic action stars light up the screen for pure combustible entertainment in Sly Stallone's The Expendables, a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Inglourious Basterds""--and then some."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"If you want to see old-fashioned nonstop mayhem with stars so venerable that ""The Leathernecks"" (and I don't mean Marines) might be an alternative title, reviews are going to be superfluous. If you don't want to go, no review can change your mind."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"This is action as timeless as the reptilian brain-and if The Expendables is no classic, for about 20 minutes, it blowed up real good."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,60,"More The Wild Geese than The Wild Bunch, The Expendables is not a wasted opportunity, but more one not fully exploited."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"If anyone gets a career boost from The Expendables it will be Dolph Lundgren, playing a drug-addicted loose Howitzer booted from the team and flipping to the bad side."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"The trailers already have given away the ""surprise"" cameos in The Expendables, so try not to blink when Stallone goes into a church (shades of John Woo) to meet his mystery boss, played by a bald-pated, trademark smirking Bruce Willis."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"What you will find is both familiar in its contours and unique in its casting: the definitive alterkocker action picture. Call it ""The Old Dogs of War,"" or ""Incontinent Basterds."""
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"Next to the hopelessly inexpressive Stallone and the English-impaired Li, Statham emerges as the movie's principal wit. But the script furnishes him with only a few deadpan quips. Besides, it's no great accomplishment to be the funniest guy in a Sylvester Stallone flick."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"Still, what makes Sly's new film fascinating is that, 35 years after he created and starred in the ultimate little-boy fantasy, ""Rocky,"" Stallone remains such a guileless, big-dreaming innocent."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"The Expendables feels, well -- disposable, a movie whose nostalgia  isn't enough to make this 50. caliber trip down Memory Lane worth the fake napalm."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"And give credit to Stallone: He just leaves the camera on Rourke, in the tightest of close-ups, cutting only once, to himself, for a one-second reaction shot, but keeping the focus on his actor. A great actor."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"I love a good, brainless action flick as much as the next alpha male, but this time I had a whole lot of trouble laughing along."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"In the final analysis, The Expendables is little more than an ordinary, uninspired action feature."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"At one point Rourke delivers a monologue about his time in Bosnia, and the conviction the actor brings to the occasion throws the movie completely out of whack. What's actual acting doing in a movie like this?"
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,50,"Stallone directs a bloodbath that borrows liberally from such male-bonding classics as Robert Aldrich's ""The Dirty Dozen"" and Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch,"" but offers not a whiff of the tragic fatalism and astute critique of machismo that inform those superior dramas."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,42,"The opening action sequence, unrelated to the main story, is nicely done, but after that it's all downhill."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,42,"Brainless, witless, inept, ugly and crude,"
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"A nearly incoherent all-stars-on-deck actioner that plays like ""Grown Ups"" on nitro or a brutish, blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven."""
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"Might more aptly be described as Bad Kurosawa, Bad Peckinpah or Bad Leone. Which might be a way of saying that it's better-than-average Stallone. I can't quite say that it's not bad: it is bad! But not entirely in a bad way."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,The thought behind this body-splattering nostalgia trip is unformed and stagnant.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"You see this cast, you expect to see a lot of violent action. And in that regard, The Expendables delivers, and then some. In this case, then, the old saying applies: Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,40,"It's big, it's loud, it's dumb, and all things considered, it's not completely un-fun."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,"So why oh why is The Expendables such a limp-dick bust? Because Stallone forgets to include non-spazzy direction, a coherent plot, dialogue that actors can speak without cringing, stunts that don't fizzle, blood that isn't digital and an animating spirit that might convince us to give a damn."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,Sadistic mess of a movie.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,"Incoherent, inept, testosterone-drenched mess, which is very much the brain-dead male equivalent of ""Sex and the City 2."""
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,38,Jason Statham gives the best performance. Dolph Lundgren gets the best character arc. Terry Crews gets the best gun. Jet Li gets the best kill (you'll know it when you see it).Arnold Schwarzenegger gets the best cameo. And Sylvester Stallone? He gets the blame.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,30,The whole exercise has the trying-too-hard vibe of a bad toupee.
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,12,"There's never any real danger in the movie, which makes The Expendables feel like one of those chummy Rat Pack flicks that were just excuses for a bunch of pals to get together and goof off."
The Expendables,6.5,103068524,10,"The Expendables is savage yet inert, and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,88,"The best thing about this movie is that you believe in the relationship. Hart and Johnson are a classic comedy duo in the tradition of Abbott & Costello, Bob Hope & Bing Crosby and Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,75,"Central Intelligence is genuinely funny, intriguingly plotted, and quite frankly one of the biggest surprises of the year."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,75,What makes Central Intelligence appealing in appalling times is volcanic chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,70,"Central Intelligence won’t blow you out of the theater, but you might be surprised at how well it works — how genuinely funny it is — given the familiarity of this concept."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,70,"Central Intelligence is dumb in all the right ways, and also a bit smarter than you might expect."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,67,"Central Intelligence manages to be a far more coherent comedy than I would have expected, and it’s a worthy representation of the genre."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,Central Intelligence is actually funny.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,There’s such a genuine sweetness to Johnson you can’t help digging the shtick.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,"Central Intelligence won’t win any points for originality, but that doesn’t make it any less funny."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,63,"It dawdles between action beats and big laughs, and in the third act, that lets much of the wind out of it."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"There may not have been such an awkwardly homoerotic bromance-seduction on film since Jim Carrey molested Matthew Broderick in The Cable Guy, but it’s one of Central Intelligence’s redeeming features that it’s generously forgiving, rather than nastily phobic, of Bob’s quirks."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,This is a much better comedy than it is an action movie.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"You come to this movie hoping that Johnson and Hart make you laugh. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don’t. The hit-to-miss ratio is higher than you might expect, and both actors could accurately be described as pleasant, if not especially creative."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"Thank the movie gods for Dwayne Johnson, who delivers a performance of such charm, such unexpected goofiness that the screen practically glows every time he appears."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"The result, while instantly forgettable, is a fundamentally pleasurable experience."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,60,"Central Intelligence demonstrates an above-average interest in story and character, and tries, if not always successfully, to craft real comic situations and action sequences. It's been made with a certain level of polish and professionalism. And it capitalizes on the chemistry between Hart and Johnson."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"Nearly (but not quite) redeemed by its good nature and the megaton charisma of its two stars, Central Intelligence is a dopey blockbuster diversion that will surely keep United Airlines passengers entertained during the dog days of summer."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"While not necessarily a diamond-in-the-rough itself, Central Intelligence proves that Johnson has always been at the center of his own ring, in more ways than one. It just took the rest of us (and Hollywood) a little longer to notice."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,58,"Central Intelligence doesn’t feel like the birth of a great comic duo — more like a blind date that goes a little better than expected. The chemistry’s not there yet, but let’s give it another shot."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"By the time the film reaches its obvious conclusion – by the time Hart expends more energy than Bugs Bunny, by the time the espionage plot twists itself into corners too convoluted for even ""Homeland"" fans, by the time Thurber exhausts the audience by unleashing cameo after cameo – it’s only Johnson who remains standing tall."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"The film itself is painless, strained, occasionally amusing, and utterly disposable — just another studio buddy comedy/action movie that forgot where it put the script."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"It’s straightforward, it’s pretty funny and it stars two good actors who seem to be trying really hard to leave audiences satisfied."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,Central Intelligence always takes the lazy way out. You go along for the ride because Hart and Johnson promise something they can't deliver: a movie as funny as they are.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"While it fails to deliver convincing action and its comedy feels watered down, Central Intelligence does get the “buddy” aspect correct. Doing their best with a script (also by Ike Barinholtz and David Stasser) that feels all-too-safe, Johnson and Hart manage to prove that a movie can glide by just enough on sheer charisma alone."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"The blend of Johnson’s laid-back hero-dudeness and Hart’s whippet-fast comic timing should have been good fun. But somebody, alas, had an idea, though not a good one: Make Johnson the comedian and Hart the straight man."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,"It delivers — on some basic, giddy, turn-off-your-frontal-lobes level. It’s an action-comedy utensil, like “Rush Hour” crossed with an old Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot-’em-up, with a few goofy added sprinkles of “Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion.”"
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,50,It's a pity that no one else involved in the making of the film had Dwayne Johnson's sly intuition.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,42,"Any time the duo build up a significant amount of energy, the messy mechanics of the story come barreling in, shifting the narrative attention to the tedious developments involving encryption keys, which is nothing more than a Macguffin to begin with."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,42,"That it manages to score a good laugh every couple of minutes is mostly a credit to stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, who make for a better mismatched-buddy comic duo than the movie probably deserves."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,An action comedy without any action or comedy – not even The Rock’s charisma and enthusiasm can save this dud.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,Even the obligatory blooper reel after the film isn’t as funny as it should be.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,An odd-couple caper of staggering dopeyness that makes you long for the snap and sizzle of the buddy movies of the 1980s.
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,40,"A throwaway film that in all the worst ways give summer movies a bad name: told by idiots, full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing but first-weekend grosses."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,38,"Central Intelligence is one of those slick, gunplay-riddled, stupidly plotted, aggressively loud buddy movies — so formulaic and dumb, even if you see it you’ll probably forget you’ve seen it by the end of the year...And if that’s the case, consider yourself fortunate."
Central Intelligence,6.3,127440871,25,"With its canned, predictable action sequences and mirthless attempts at humor, it displays an ineptitude that is frankly shocking considering the talent involved."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,88,"This movie is more sophisticated and complicated than the Westerns of my childhood, and it is certainly better looking and better acted."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,80,"Silverado is sufficiently modern to make its landscapes bigger, its people smaller and its moral polarities less powerfully distinct than those of simpler, more starkly beautiful westerns gone by."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,80,"Rather than relying on legendary heroes of Westerns past, writer-director Lawrence Kasdan with his brother Mark have used their special talent to create a slew of human scale characters against a dramatic backdrop borrowing from all the conventions of the genre."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,80,Engrossing western which inspired a huge genre revivial.
Silverado,7.2,33200000,70,"It's best when the carefully chosen cast throws itself into developing characters and building their relationships. When pure storytelling takes over after an hour or so, the picture becomes less original and engaging."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,63,"Between the gratuitous climaxes that seem to occur every 10 minutes, Kasdan parades a myriad of stereotypes before us and never develops them.  In fact, he never really explores any of his characters but only provides them with enough motivation to justify the slaughter of dozens of people."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,63,"Agreeable but never compelling, Silverado proves it takes more than love of the western to make a good one. Maybe the dudes at K-Tell were a mite too slick for the job."
Silverado,7.2,33200000,63,"This 1985 western does a decent job of developing some dry 80s humor without completely undermining the genre, yet Kasdan's considerable skills as a plot carpenter seem to desert him as soon as the story moves to the town of the title--the action turns choppy, confused, and arbitrary."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,90,"The other is a scene, improvised on the set, when Bond does a double take on seeing Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington (recently stolen from London's National Gallery) in Dr No's palatial living room. It's the funniest moment in any Bond picture and one of cinema's great art jokes."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"The beginning of the super-successful franchise, this remains one of the most satisfying Bond films."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"First screen adventure of Ian Fleming's hardhitting, fearless, imperturbable, girl-loving Secret Service Agent 007, James Bond, is an entertaining piece of tongue-in-cheek action hokum. Sean Connery excellently puts over a cool, fearless, on-the-ball, fictional Secret Service guy. Terence Young directs with a pace which only occasionally lags."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"As memorable as anything in the series (the arteries hadn't hardened yet) are modest highlights like Bond's encounter with a tarantula, Honeychile's first appearance as a nymph from the sea, the perils of Dr No's assault course of pain."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,80,"All of the elements of the formula are there, but in pleasing moderation."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,75,"There are no gadgets, forcing Bond to rely on his ingenuity (in one scene, when he needs to breathe while submerged, he uses hollowed-out reeds as air tubes). The single car chase is reasonably straightforward. And, for the only time in the series, 007 is unmistakably brutalized, appearing bloody, beaten, and disheveled as a result."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,75,"A solid, surprisingly modest spy thriller, enlivened by Sean Connery's screen charisma and occasional hints of the extravagance to come."
Dr. No,7.3,16067035,70,"This lively, amusing picture is not to be taken seriously as realistic fiction or even art, any more than the works of Mr. Fleming are to be taken as long-hair literature. It is strictly a tinseled action-thriller, spiked with a mystery of a sort. And, if you are clever, you will see it as a spoof of science-fiction and sex."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,100,"Never Say Never Again illustrates how much sheer entertainment value can accrue when seasoned, disciplined filmmakers are encouraged to use their accumulated experience and design a classy piece of escapism to the best of their abilities."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,88,"What makes Never Say Never Again more fun than most of the Bonds is more complex than that. For one thing, there's more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo. Brandauer is a wonderful actor, and he chooses not to play the villain as a cliché. Instead, he brings a certain poignancy and charm to Largo, and since Connery always has been a particularly human James Bond, the emotional stakes are more convincing this time."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,80,What clicks best in the film is the casting. Klaus Maria Brandauer makes one of the best Bond opponents since very early in the series.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,80,"As directed by Irvin Kershner, Never Say Never Again has noticeably more humor and character than the Bond films usually provide. It has a marvelous villain in Largo."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,80,"The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff. Civilisation is safe in the hands of he who has never tasted quiche, and who, on the evidence here, at least, can perform a very passable tango."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,75,"Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007,"
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,70,It is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,70,Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,63,"A persistent disappointment... a flabby, cutesy Bond picture, which derives most of its enduring entertainment value from its cast—starting with the man at the top."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,60,"Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again is a poor excuse for the veteran actor's return. The humor is over-the-top, the direction is pedestrian, and the storyline drags. Were it not for the simple pleasure of seeing Connery playing 007 one more time, this film would have been nearly unwatchable. All things considered, it's not a very good movie, but at least Connery's charisma salvages parts of it. Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again is a poor excuse for the veteran actor's return.

All things considered, it's not a very good movie, but at least Connery's charisma salvages parts of it."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,58,"Connery delivers his usual charming performance, and Brandauer (MEPHISTO, OUT OF AFRICA) makes a great Bond villain. Gone is the excessive gadgetry that mars Bond films, and, as a result, the characters are more prominent and colorful."
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,50,Never Say Never Again never reaches the escapist thrills of vintage Connery and Moore; it cares too much about getting sued than it does about giving the actor a vehicle worth coming back to.
Never Say Never Again,6.2,55500000,50,"It's his sense that he is superior to the series (which he certainly is) that introduces a fatal strain of campiness and condescension. And without absolute conviction, no action film can survive: if there's no belief, there's no danger."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,58,"Maybe that call will be answered next time with enough incremental improvements to finally notch a good Divergent movie, a possibility Allegiant raises repeatedly and frustratingly. Ultimately, though, this movie isn’t just adhering to a formula; it’s carefully following a recipe designed to offset any good ingredients that get mixed in there by mistake."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,56,"“Allegiant” ends up feeling like a mid-season climax to serialized TV drama. The pieces are in play, the wheels in motion. Stay tuned, loyal viewers, and you’ll get your answers next year."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"The special effects are among the more positive aspects of “Allegiant,” but those alone cannot rescue this highly flawed sequel."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,Allegiant tries to cram too little story into too much time. This results in dead spots and uneven pacing.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Director Robert Schwentke and his writing team do their best to move things along.
Actually, who knows if it's their best? Maybe they're suffering from Divergent fatigue along with the rest of us."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Allegiant aches to be a thought-provoking, moving allegory of the current world. Instead, it’s an unwieldy two hours too unintentionally silly to validate how seriously it takes itself."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Because the series' plot reveal turns out to be more confusing than compelling, and because turning a novel into two films invariably leads to inflated productions, only the most devoted fans of the book will pledge allegiance to what's on the screen."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"Combines the usual dumb ideas with one good one. And not just good, but impressive, in that it makes sense of much of what went before."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"This doesn’t even feel much like Tris’s story anymore, just generically overdigitized combat. The main thing she’s diverging from at this point is the tone that hooked us in the first place."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,50,"The film moves jerkily, in fits and starts, squandering its promising setup and bogging down in explanation."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Let's just call ""Allegiant"" what it is: A way for the studio to make money and bring you back next year for the real finale. See you then. Maybe."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,The only thing that's revolting is how dull the series has gotten.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"This over-extended teen dystopia is treading water, coming up short on its trademark punchy plotting, teen self-discovery and the wonderful Woodley."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Big but boring, expansive but cheap-looking, Allegiant spins in place, waiting for next year’s Ascendent to come along and offer resolution. In all candour: you can do without it."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Like the earlier Divergent films, Allegiant is studded with enticing science-fiction ideas, but it keeps such a poker-straight face while presenting them, you often can’t help but crack up."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Instead of bringing much-needed clarity, Allegiant piles on yet more bamboozling mythology to flummox and confound."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Long, shiny, and treading a lot of water."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"It all leads to a climax so staggeringly lazy and glib that you honestly expect Woodley just to turn to the camera in the final scene, shrug her shoulders and walk off."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"For a film that takes great pride in its heroine's nonconformism, pretty much everything in Allegiant feels conventional."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,40,"Although “Allegiant” does recapture the original film’s sense of constantly discovering and adapting to fresh information, audiences no longer identify with anyone in particular."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"As tedious as much of this sounds, an odd thing happened around “Allegiant’s” midway point. The fairly packed audience started vocally reacting “Rocky Horror”-style to some of the more overtly melodramatic turns with “oohs,"" “ahhs” and even laughter."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"All of it feels warmed over, reprocessed … and, yes, confused."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,38,"It's a pretty dull picture, I must say, because it's my duty to say it. And it's a pretty dull picture, I must say, because something about its particular grade of dullness may cause memory loss."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,37,Everything is needlessly tangled and bewildering.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,33,"Above all of the tiresome, poorly constructed mythology, nonexistent stakes, and presentation of subtext as text, Allegiant’s greatest sin is its total contempt for its viewers."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,"Three films into the ongoing Divergent series, one would hope we’d moved beyond laying plates and folding napkins to get to something more substantial. Yet Allegiant barely makes it to the appetizer course."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,"The actors still give it their all in Allegiant, but there's only so much they can do with such a clunky, verbose script. And on the rare occasion that the film actually quiets its characters down and delivers something resembling action, it's woefully inert."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,30,A story that kicked off two years ago at a reasonable gallop has now slowed to barely a limp.
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"If only their stuff had a spark of life it might be forgivable, but Allegiant plods along like a franchise on its last legs. Who remembers where we left off last time in Insurgent? My point exactly — no one."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"Try as I might, I cannnot activate your interest in this bloated excuse for a movie."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"The pleasures of Allegiant are unintended, those little bits of business taken so seriously that serious viewers must laugh."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,25,"This sort of movie really should be about more than meekly obvious names for human traits separated into tribes, the future tech, the dystopian landscape, the fashions, the hair styles...But there isn’t a line that lands, a scene that sticks with you, an emotion you feel or a moment this movie drags you to the edge of your seat."
Allegiant,5.7,66184051,0,"By the time David gets someone to unleash the gas, I was wishing he could simply erase all memories of the sorry “Divergent’’ franchise."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,90,"For Your Eyes Only bears not the slightest resemblance to the Ian Fleming novel of the same title, but emerges as one of the most thoroughly enjoyable of the 12 Bond pix [to date] despite fact that many of the usual ingredients in the successful 007 formula are missing."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,75,"For Your Eyes Only is a solid adventure, although it could have been better. There's enough action to hold those with even a short attention span, and Roger Moore's deft charm hasn't yet begun to wear thin."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,75,"The success of this picture (perhaps Moore's best in the Bond series) can be attributed to the marvelous direction of Glen, who had previously worked as a second-unit director on earlier Bond movies. Not surprisingly, the stunts are some of the best in the series."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,"Most of the time, though, For Your Eyes Only is a slick entertainment...not the spaced-out fun that ""Moonraker"" was, but its tone is consistently comic even when the material is not."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,Glen's style...goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,70,"For Your Eyes Only is a competent James Bond thriller, well-crafted, a respectable product from the 007 production line. But it's no more than that."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,50,"To evaluate For Your Eyes Only and the other Bond movies, it helps to think of them not as, say, different vintages of a fine Bordeaux but as successive models off the Pontiac assembly line. In one vehicle there may be an annoying ping in the engine of narrative; in another the dialogue may be as sleek as Genuine Corinthian Leather. But all meet the same standards of speed, styling and emotion control. If there is no Rolls-Royce in the Bond series, there is also no Pinto."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,50,"Moore just looks confused. He obviously wants to do his thing then hit the bar for cocktails, but John Glen is nagging him to add a roughness to the slick exterior. Equally, it just doesn’t fit. The news is clear, there’s only so far you can push a Bond before it breaks."
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,40,Eyes is somehow too relaxing to be satisfying.
For Your Eyes Only,6.8,62300000,40,"Worth a try, but without his Art Dept clothes on, Bond is like the naked Emperor. Look, Ma, no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,70,"To the fan of 80s slashers, this return to glorious excess is a beautiful thing."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,67,"So can Freddy beat up Jason, or what? Let's just say that neither one would have stood a chance against Abbott and Costello."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,63,A surprisingly ambitious entry into a genre that felt bankrupt and over more than a decade ago.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,63,"Succeeds as a guilty pleasure, a monster mash that clobbers the recent lackluster sequels plaguing both legacies. If only that were a higher compliment."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,60,Visually imaginative and energetic.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Considering what the filmmakers had to work with, and the fact that it has all been done before, Freddy Vs. Jason isn't bad. And sometimes not bad is almost good."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Attempts none of the witty, provocative visual and metaphysical set pieces from any of the ''Nightmare'' movies. And it offers none of the real fright of the early ''Friday the 13th'' films. In fact, the movie is deeply, proudly unimaginative."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"The setup is bad even by slasher-film standards: poorly acted, atrociously written and unimaginatively directed. But once Freddy and Jason have at it, the movie takes on a recklessly kinetic energy that finally delivers on its title's promise."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Truth be told, the movie isn't among the worst sequels of this summer."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"The best way to sum up Freddy Vs. Jason is: good concept, mediocre execution."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Are these iconic, antihero relics smartly satirized in a post-slasher, or is FVJ just more dated, third-wave trash? Disappointingly, it's the latter."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Though a stickler might ask what's at stake in a fight to the death between two guys who are already dead, the hard-core fans aren't likely to be disappointed."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,The basic formula of iconic supernatural beings slaughtering plucky teenagers continues with even more graphic violence.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,50,"Tremendous energy, outrageous humor, dazzling technical finesse -- and a numbing amount of violence, brutality, bloodshed and all-out savagery. It is downright depressing to think about all that vigorous cinematic artistry and expertise aimed so low."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,42,"Doesn't have any of the creepy suspense that graced the first ""Friday"" movies, and very little of the Daliesque dream imagery of the early ""Nightmares."" It's just a slam-bang succession of gross-out mutilations, played for giggles."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,40,The sentimental novelty of watching two childhood antiheroes have at it dissipates once you realize the lugubrious lengths to which the screenplay must go in order to make that happen.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,40,"This long-awaited monster mash should satisfy fans of the ""Friday the 13th/A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchises."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,38,"Since there can be no suspense, the point is to enjoy the hewing of limbs and the severing of necks, to delight in chopped-off fingers and gouged-out eyes. The title characters are embodiments of utter evil, right?"
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,38,"Too much chatting, not enough chills."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,38,"Despite oblique references to ""Psycho"" and ""Children of the Corn,"" Freddy vs. Jason lacks the knowing wit needed to keep it afloat in an age when even the horror spoofs have been spoofed."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"The Hong Kong vet director, Ronny Yu, did a bang-up job in 1998 with ""Bride of Chucky,"" but he can't do much for this one except keep it moving, light it scarily, and pump that plasma."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"This dumb, only intermittently (though sometimes even intentionally) funny sequel presumes that since almost everything else from the 1980's has come back, why not the cynosures of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" movies?"
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"The first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was wickedly surreal, but the wacky dream sequences were offset by the sitcomlike, almost satirical flatness of ordinary suburban life; that was the really scary part. Freddy Vs. Jason is innocent of such nuances."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"A kind of cinematic analogue of the Iran-Iraq war: It's overlong, it's hard to tell which one's the bad guy, and it's filled with lots of senseless carnage on both sides."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,30,"Aside from a promising scene involving a cornfield rave and the pyrotechnic potential for grain alcohol, it drags along, taking a small eternity to set up a final showdown that plays more like a bloody pro-wrestling event than the stuff of nightmares."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,25,"Connoisseurs of giant, gnarled chunks of charred flesh, rejoice! There's plenty of it -- or stuff resembling it -- in the slasher-fest convergence of two killer franchises."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,20,Formulaic hodge-podge that trades on a certain demographic's affection for the bogeymen of their formative years.
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,20,"About as threadbare as a favorite childhood plushy. What's more, trying to keep the story line of strained meta-sequel Freddy Vs. Jason straight requires too much of a cogitative investment."
Freddy dae Jason,5.8,82622655,20,"Witless, excessive and ultimately boring gore-a-thon."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,90,"George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson are responsible for the story and screenplay, which was directed by John Glen, who does much better than he did with ""For Your Eyes Only."" However, the material is markedly better, and the budget seems noticeably larger. Peter Lamont's production design is both extravagant and funny."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,90,"One of the snazziest, wittiest productions in the history of the serial."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,80,"This finds Bond on better form than he's been for some time. The action sequences are tighter, the visual gags more inventive, and if the plot is no great shakes, the whole thing is served up with a decent approximation to the old panache."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,80,Film’s high points are the spectaccular aerial stuntwork marking both the pre-credits teaser and extremely dangerous-looking climax.
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,80,"One for the die hards. The saving grace here is a knowing sense of humour so lacking in its predecessor, For Your Eyes Only."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,63,"There's a fine line between wit and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,63,"Glen's willingness to give the action sequences a certain weight and seriousness produces some genuinely exciting moments, yet his work is everywhere undermined by the flatness of the characterizations and the uncertain architecture of the plot. Still, Maud Adams makes a nice impression and Roger Moore has shed some of his smarminess."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,60,"Directed by John Glen, who keeps the excitement level high for an hour or so, then lets the show slip into the doldrums."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,60,"OCTOPUSSY features the usual array of fine stunt work and special effects, and Adams' appearance marks the first time that a Bond woman was allowed an encore performance, but little is added that departs from the Bond formula."
Octopussy,6.6,67900000,50,"When he had started playing this game of Save the Planet—when he was roguish Sean Connery and the world was so much younger—Bond had been a kind of role model for people of a certain class and ambition. Savoir-faire meant the aristocracy of style: which wine to decant, which brand of cigarette to smoke, which automatic weapon to carry under the armpit. Now that he was Roger Moore, 20 years later, Bond had degenerated into a male model, and something of a genial anachronism."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,91,It sheds the series' famous and influential pastel look and plunges its cast of villains and warriors into the 21st century.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,90,"Mann has done something transformative with Farrell: The Irish actor has never had this much charisma and natural authority in a role, and as he navigates that gray area between Crockett's real identity and his fabricated one, revealing subtle fissures in the character's cocksure facade, he's fascinating to watch."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,88,"If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,88,"Miami Vice isn't an action flick but a neo-noir: tough, quiet, moody and hard."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,88,"Sensual and scary, the movie is so visually textured you feel as though you're brushing against the screen."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,83,"While it never approaches the richness and gravity of a great Mann film like ""Heat,"" Miami Vice blurs the thin blue line to similar effect, and he features a couple of bravura setpieces, including a tense raid on an enemy hideout and a shootout with chaotic, you-are-there immediacy. If only all summer movies were this majestically slight."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,83,Right away in Miami Vice you know you're waist-deep in movieland.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"It's a sensational trip -- gorgeous, gaga."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"Mixing pop savvy with startling formal ambition, Mr. Mann transforms what is essentially a long, fairly predictable cop-show episode into a dazzling (and sometimes daft) Wagnerian spectacle."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"The world according to Mann is loud, dangerous, morally ambiguous, and more than a little greasy, but during the hours you spend there, there's nowhere you'd rather be."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"Bearing all the Mann hallmarks, this is visually enthralling, relentlessly stylish crime drama. A little too languorous for its own good at times, but still vastly superior entertainment."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,80,"The two best words to describe the 2006 motion picture Miami Vice are ""stylish"" and ""intense."""
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,"As entertaining as some of it is, is so cool that it's almost too cool. It takes the sin, and much of the juice, out of vice."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,"This is more of a thinking man's action flick -- a small, intense film made on a giant canvas that finds Mann experimenting with and pushing at the boundaries of mainstream filmmaking."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,75,"Unlike most TV-to-movie transitions, Mann returns to his roots and delivers what amounts to a slightly overblown episode, brimming with style and characteristically short on substance."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,70,"Without the ability to move off the mythic, without the emotional texture that ""Heat"" created, it is a film easier to admire than to get passionately involved with."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,70,"Mann turns Miami Vice into an exploration of tone and mood, and he makes that enough."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,70,"As it turns out, the movie is still very much about two well-dressed undercover cops who strike sexy poses, express plenty of attitude and drive expensive cars and fast boats as pop music plays on the soundtrack and palm trees sway gently in the tropical night."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,67,It's got some great action sequences and is peppered with genuinely dazzling images. It's also subtly infused with Mann's favored themes of men-at-work and the high price of loyalty to duty. But it hasn't got sufficient meat to warrant its draggy length.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,67,It's refreshing to hear some old-fashioned percussive tension in service of a director who knows what he's doing. Even when the screenwriter is losing his way.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"Just when the plot should start coming together, the pacing goes slack and the narrative gets bogged down in routine cop-movie clichés."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"Miami Vice is the last of the predicted summer blockbusters, and it delivers a
reasonable amount of popcorn excitement. But if nostalgia for the TV show is the
source of your interest, expect some disappointment."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"A combination of muddy sound mix and players with heavy accents (particularly Chinese superstar Gong, who seems to have learned her lines phonetically) renders large swaths of dialogue incomprehensible, but the details of what's being said and done don't really matter."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,63,"It's about guns and sex and fast boats, and, baffling as it is at times, it's still the kind of brutal fantasy that many of us relish a great deal more than yet another aerated digital dream."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,60,"Dark, detailed and only really gets going when the gunplay starts."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,60,"A darker, grittier creature that, while benefiting considerably from Dion Beebe's HD cinematography, is a frustratingly inert affair -- a long and talky excursion that fails to engage the viewer from the outset."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"It's filled with Mann's signature macho verisimilitude, but essentially it's the stuff of what, in saner fiscal times, would have been a B movie. Miami Vice delivers the thrills, atmosphere and romance it promises, but it doesn't resonate like major Mann."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Miami Vice, the movie, is an atmospheric muddle, as gorgeous and unintelligible as raven-haired stunner Gong Li."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Farrell appears to be a rarity in undercover culture, a vice cop who goes on the lowdown as an Irish beatnik. Oh, that's a good disguise for South Beach. As for Foxx, he's still channeling Ray Charles through squinty eyes and a kind of shaky head. They have zero chemistry."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Apart from a few sleek shots involving boats or helicopters, the action eventually devolves into a standard war-movie shootout."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,It's the supporting players who stand out.
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"Far from a disaster, but doesn't rank with Mann's best work."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,50,"If you really must see Miami Vice (and you mustn't), buy a ticket to something better, then slip into ""Vice"" at the 95-minute mark and watch the last third of the movie. No one involved will profit by your curiosity, and you won't miss a thing of importance."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,38,"All this movie has in common with its ancestor are speedboats, shotguns and drug-dealing Colombians."
Miami Vice,6.0,63450470,38,"Perhaps vice isn't what it used to be, or maybe Crockett and Tubbs just aren't all that interesting when removed from their appropriate time slot, but this may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,80,"In a summer of high-octane action and testosterone-boosted thrills, this movie is out of its league."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,63,"The concept is high but everything else is merely fair to middling, one more or less watchable B-movie in megabucks clothing."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,63,"Robinson's script is alive to the material's literary roots, although there is a sense that the brakes have been applied so as not to push into territory perceived as too esoteric for American teenagers."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,60,"The filmmakers tried to give everyone a main storyline and ended up diluting everything. With so many characters, the film lost some focus."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,60,"It depicts the world of a century ago in a way that comments on the anxieties facing the world today, and it does so, at least for a while, with cleverness and a sense of fun."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,50,"Here, finally, is a superhero movie your AP English teacher can enjoy."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,50,"The movie is based on a 1999 series of comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, but the original tone of deadpan historical audacity has been replaced by a kind of wax-museum literalness."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,42,"The film wears out its welcome by the halfway mark, becoming a silly spectacle."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,42,"One more bloated effects-o-rama lumbering through a formula plot (super-villain out to rule the world) without much zest, imagination or awareness of its own absurdity."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,42,"Simply put, its too much of a good thing, this unreined tumult of chaos."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,"Moore invested his characters with flaws, with a tangible humanity; God knows they never felt the need to explain themselves, as the film does, rendering it something akin to one long footnote."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,The irony of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is that it has the most literate pedigree of any action movie you're likely to see this year or next -- and it's been made by people who seem to have no sense of how to tell a story.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,40,These guys have dumbed down a comic book.

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,30,"Nothing anchors the lighter-than-air story as it drifts away under the direction of Stephen Norrington (""Blade"") into an FX stratosphere where wit, character and vigorous storytelling cease to matter."

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,25,"Just when it seems about to become a real corker of an adventure movie, plunges into incomprehensible action, idiotic dialogue, inexplicable motivations, causes without effects, effects without causes, and general lunacy. What a mess."
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,25,"Opium- addicted Allan Quatermain becomes none other than Sean Connery. At least he gives a real movie-star performance, which is more than the other gentlemen manage. Extraordinary? Balderdash!"
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,25,Bloated and incoherent.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,Extraordinary is the very last adjective that comes to mind.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,"A stiff. I don't know the comic book series, but it could hardly be as lifeless as this leaden adaptation, in which the weapons have more personality than the characters and the nonstop action often feels like no action at all."

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,20,Six guys and a gal who flatline on arrival. Easily the lamest action-adventure fantasy since Wild Wild West.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,12,Unfathomable balderdash.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,5.8,66465204,12,"It's not brazenly bad or heroically bad or stridently bad. It's bad in all the old, dull ways of being bad: poor performances, absurd story, dreary special effects, witless dialogue and the excessive length of someone taking himself far too seriously."
Species,5.8,60074103,80,"Species is an Alien ripoff, but that doesn't make it a bad movie--not when it contains a plausible premise, a great-looking female villain, a wonderful supporting cast of good guys, and genuine tension. Only a routine chase sequence in sewer tunnels limits the excitement at the end. In other words, we're talking about a solid, surprisingly intelligent action picture here."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,"A propulsive sci-fi actioner genetically engineered from spores of the Alien and Terminator series, Roger Donaldson's Species provides a gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,"Director Roger Donaldson has a lot of fun with his premise. The top-notch special effects, which use a lot of seamless computer animation, make the climax look very nice. The rest of the film is essentially one long chase sequence with a couple of nude scenes and maulings added to liven up the proceedings. No matter what genre you identify Species as, it's not top of the line, but there's also quite a bit of room beneath it."
Species,5.8,60074103,75,Despite the ridiculous premise and casting this is still a pacey little sci-thriller.
Species,5.8,60074103,70,"I can imagine a film in which a creature like Sil struggles with her dual nature, and tries to find self-knowledge. Like Frankenstein's monster, she would be an object of pity. But that would be way too subtle for Species, which just adds a slick front end to the basic horror vocabulary of things jumping out from behind stuff."
Species,5.8,60074103,63,"If Species sounds ridiculous, it is -- though as ridiculous science fiction films go, this one has its moments. As usual, these moments come early."
Species,5.8,60074103,63,"The direction by Roger Donaldson is facile and understated, as is, for the most part, the script by Dennis Feldman. Even the actors pitch in to play down the silliness of it all."
Species,5.8,60074103,60,"A shameless Alien rip-off (it even uses a similar typeface in its ads), it makes no sense whatsoever. But don't hold the movie's utter unoriginality and brainlessness against it. A few laughs, a few popcorn-jolting scares—what more do you want on a hot summer night?"
Species,5.8,60074103,60,"Alien meets Basic Instinct in this textbook illustration of what happens when millions of dollars' worth of technical expertise is brought to bear on a cheap, exploitative script."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"It doesn’t help that the special effects are second-rate; the squishy primal horror of Alien has been replaced by a kind of mechanized yuckiness. The team of B-movie scientists tracking the monster includes Ben Kingsley doing his over-deliberate American accent, Alfred Molina sporting a haircut that’s scarier than the creature, and Forest Whitaker as an empath so sensitive he can’t let anyone sneeze without making a dewy-eyed psychic pronouncement."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,Species carries the whole idea of the erotic thriller--that '80s yuppie genre that mixed sex and slaughter--past cliche into howling absurdity.
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"The director, Roger Donaldson, best known for the Kevin Costner thriller No Way Out, keeps the film moving. But there is only so much suspense he can generate from this stock story and familiar-looking special effects. Species may work best for viewers who don't like to be too scared by horror movies; it's reassuringly familiar."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"Director Roger Donaldson may have started out aiming for intentional thrills, but ends up with unintentional comedy as his characters do and say the darndest things."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"Like some state-of-the-art remake of Lifeforce, this is every bit as bad as Tobe Hooper's film, but nothing like as enjoyable. Worst is the transition in the final scenes from snatched glimpses of a woman in a rubber suit to some oddly alienating motion-control effects. Floating like the ghosting on a poorly tuned TV, these are far too clean and artificial to be believable or remotely scary. Deserves extinction."
Species,5.8,60074103,50,"What else can I say about a movie in which even a brilliant artist like H.R. Giger repeats himself… except that besides a few random moments, Species just doesn't make the grade and also manages to waste a fine cast along the way."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,100,"In the end this is Hoffman's movie, and it's refreshing, finally, to see him not as an oddball or eccentric but as a decent, capable guy who is ultimately a lot more intense than most people."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,88,"The thriller occupies the same territory as countless science fiction movies about deadly invasions and high-tech conspiracies, but has been made with intelligence and an appealing human dimension."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,83,"Petersen pulls off the thrills at a stomach lurching pace, and with its requisite Hollywood ham - husband and wife reuniting over piles of haemorrhaging bodies - loud performances, crashing stunts and a fearsome, hypochondria-inducing conceit, there's barely room to catch your breath, let alone cry foul."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,80,"Outbreak is sharp, sometimes-exploitative entertainment that does its job with great efficiency."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,80,Outbreak is an absolute hoot thanks primarily to director Wolfgang Petersen's rabid pacing and the great care he brings to setting up the story and its probability.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,75,It's a B-movie with A-accouterments.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,75,"Whether scarily charting the spread of the virus or choreographing a cat-and-mouse chase of choppers above a winding riverbed, Petersen demonstrates a smooth stylistic savvy that keeps the film highly absorbing from beginning to end."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,70,"For today’s filmmakers, the addiction to kinetic overkill has become a disease in itself."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,70,This movie is an entertaining and sometimes wildly-exhilarating ride.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,67,Outbreak is fast on its feet and simple in its head.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,63,Outbreak has the feel of a movie written by a committee of writers -- it's totally lacking in personality.
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,63,"The effort to turn Outbreak into an action picture insures that little of it will be believable, regardless of how much scientific data has been woven into the story. The film's shallowness also contributes to the impression that no problem is too thorny to be solved by movie heroics."
Outbreak,6.6,67823573,63,"There's too much hardware, too little sense. Too much blood, too little flesh. Too much program, too little mind. That's the virus of the contemporary movie techno-thriller."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,80,"Like its hero, Ender’s Game relies on brains more than brute force. An absorbing portrait of Lord Of The Flies-style morality housed in imaginative sci-fi casing."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"Ultimately, the movie is not, to paraphrase the U.S. Army slogan, all that it could be. The climax is uninvolving generic eye candy, and the sequel-friendly coda is unconvincing."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"Ender's Game is uneven - at times almost maddeningly so - with the first half offering more enjoyment than the second. Perhaps that's because, in military-style movies, I often prefer the training segments to the battle sequences."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"A big, dark film that should satisfy the many fans of the Orson Scott Card novel and engage newcomers, too."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"Ender’s Game is more than a parable about bullying, or a disquisition on the concept of the “just war.” It’s also a rousing action film, especially in Imax."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,75,"At times Ender’s Game throws so many metaphors and moral dilemmas our way, we almost forget to appreciate the stunning and gorgeous visuals covering every inch of the screen. Almost."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,70,"Straightforward, a bit literal-minded, very faithful to the book and largely compelling."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,70,"Its strong special effects make its simulated battles effective and, echoing the book, its story line touches on a number of intriguing issues."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,70,"An impressive, thought-provoking astro-adventure that benefits from the biggest screen available."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,67,"Plenty of ideas float through Ender's Game but the notion of honing a child into a war machine is one that sticks. Writer-director Gavin Hood's adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel doesn't offer much else, bottled up with battle jargon and special effects debris as it is."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,67,"Though it can’t overcome the source material’s problematic themes — namely, Card’s intentionalist morality, which prizes a character’s ideals over their actions — or its all-too-convenient characterizations, the film manages a sustained sense of momentum and tone that is rare for a contemporary, big-budget movie."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,65,"Since it took 28 years to get it to the big screen, the fact that the end result feels rushed and hasty probably qualifies as irony."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,63,There's lots of zero-g action in Ender's Game - even old Han Solo takes a whirl.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,63,"A bit of a tweener, neither triumph nor disaster, a war-games fantasy with a use-by date of Nov. 22, when the new ""Hunger Games"" movie comes out."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"In the final analysis, that's the real endgame here: to get people into theaters and build a film franchise. For all of their film's flaws, Hood and company do that well, as Ender's Game shapes up as a decent franchise starter -- and a film that makes it hard not to be intrigued by what will come next."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"Character development, dramatic tension and emotional resonance all get short shrift in the checklist exposition by writer-director Gavin Hood."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"If only adapter-director Gavin Hood's movie had been tempered with craft and care and wasn't such a blunt instrument, one that seems designed as a delivery system for CGI derring-do instead of the heartbreaker it should be."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,This starfighter-recruit blockbuster is refreshingly idea-driven.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"The movie's apocalyptic finale indicates that it's bitten off considerably more than it can chew in terms of ideas, but it looks good, and the story rattles along."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,60,"It falters once the actual war begins: Ben Kingsley shows up as a Maori warrior with the weirdest imaginable accent, the final battle is uninvolving, and there’s an unconvincing upbeat coda. Ender’s Game ends up being fitfully engaging and endearingly odd."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,58,"By the time the movie finally manages to get interesting, audiences may be too numb and their retinas too fried to win back."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,58,"As a mainstream sci-fi film, this enjoyable, occasionally poignant effort too often feels messy in the wrong ways."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,55,"It may seem odd for a teen-focused action movie to feel so glum, but that's actually something that the director gets right, even if it threatens to make this a dull affair: Ender's Game is a dark story of a children's crusade built on the crushed psyches of damaged youths, and too much uplift would undermine it."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"I can understand wanting to skip Ender’s Game as a matter of moral principle, but you can also feel free to blow it off just because it’s not that good."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,Ender’s Game is a blandly sanitized spectacle.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Ender’s Game’s only lyrical presence is Breslin’s. The actress has a gentle soul. In the end, she’s the movie’s mascot, and its mournful spirit."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"The film's biggest problem is a matter of tone and characterization: the characters constantly talk about how mean they can be, but their actions suggest otherwise."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"It comes down to this: Which is more important, the innocence of a child or the survival of the species? And if the race survives, will it just become like the enemy aliens that must be destroyed to do so?"
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,Eventually the movie wants to have things both ways: to approvingly entertain mainstream audiences with the glittering spectacle of space battles and to pay lip service to the notion of conscience.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Hood's realization of Card's novel is a tightly constructed, thought-provoking meditation on adolescence trapped by permanent war footing, alloyed with some of the best CGI effects work I've seen since, uh, ""Gravity."""
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Mr. Butterfield is one of those young performers whose seriousness feels as if it sprang from deep within. And while he’s an appealing presence, little Ender can’t help feeling like a pint-size psycho."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"It’s a brutal story and a heady high-concept idea, but it plays out through characters with no identity other than their symbolic ones, and through shouted, simplistic arguments that repeat the same points over and over."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,50,"Sure, it’s good-looking, cautionary and clever enough. But there’s not much in this “Game” that you’d call thrilling or fun."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,40,"It admirably avoids many of the pitfalls of adapting this book, but seems to have lost some of the life and pace as well."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,38,"Most Ender's fans, of course, won't care about comparisons and consider the film adaptation a long-awaited victory in itself. Those fresh to the tale — or at least expecting something fresh from it — may wonder what the fuss was about."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,38,"Gavin Hood relays a vague sense of what it's like to live in duty, and yet at a distance from one's home, but this vision of the future never rouses, never asks to be remembered."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,30,Some of the movie isn't bad.
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,0,"Not only does Ender's Game have many scenes in zero gravity, but this zero-sum fiasco has zero drama, zero suspense, zero humor, zero charm and zero appeal."
Ender's Game,6.6,61737191,0,"Ender’s Game, the book, may have a special place in pop-lit. The movie, however, is as special as a migraine."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,75,Bay's movie is also a confident mega-production that feels it doesn't need to lean on its visual frills if it has Smith and Lawrence -- it's a natural-born buddy flick.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,75,"Watching a Bruckheimer with natural comics like Smith and Lawrence makes it all go down easily. If you like this type of movie, that is."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,70,"The bigger-than-big, rambunctious spectacle is way too much of a questionably good thing."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,70,"It may be the most winning, smile-inducing Hollywood action flick of the summer."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,70,"However masterful, the first-rate stunt work, effects, action cinematography and cutting (by no less than three editors) lose impact through sheer repetition."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,67,"Though the picture has a generic quality, it also has an ingenious amount of anything-goes that's amusing and frequently exciting. You'll laugh out loud, you'll hide your eyes -- but you'll roll them. too. Nevertheless, it's a fun, if blood- and sun-soaked, ride."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,67,Bad Boys II proves that it's possible to pack a movie with so much popcorn that it leaves the audience overdosed.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,63,"The kind of movie that gives sequels a bad name, even though, strangely enough, it's better than the 1995 hit that spawned it."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,63,"Beyond turbocharged. It whooshes along at warp speed. And still, despite some awesomely choreographed stunts and the two stars' pedal-to-the-metal appeal, the movie seems endless."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,60,"But damn it if the film doesn't work as what it's supposed to be: a big, brainless blast o' boom at the box office."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,60,"In general, Bad Boys II is Bay unleashed. This is a good thing when it comes to action sequences--fans of excessive spectacle will definitely dig the car chases that involve flying cadavers. It's a bit less of a good thing between said moments of spectacle."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,"With a body built for action and a smile made for comedy, Smith eases through his scenes -- cool but never scary, a touch hip-hop and thoroughly audience-friendly. And unlike Lawrence, he can act. Smith's ability to put over a scene, combined with his matinee charm, goes a long way to making the film's violence palatable."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,Just too much of a mediocre thing. It didn't have to be that way.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,Might be considered three action sequences and four comedy routines in search of a story.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,Martin Lawrence's Marcus is the Costello to Smith's Abbott.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,"The best moments come when Mr. Smith and Mr. Lawrence are permitted to pause from their action-hero duties and run their funny, unpredictable mouths."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,50,"Just like ""Bad Boys,"" only louder, longer and the stars get paid more."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,The movies length forces our suspension of disbelief for at least an hour more than is comfortable and pushes mindlessness to a dangerous longevity.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,"Resembles a full-length promo for itself. The action, virtually nonstop, is a series of can-you-top-this? set pieces."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,"As overblown as it is overlong, Bad Boys II is an enervating case of more is less."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,40,"If you think you're tough enough, go ahead and sit through the endurance test that is Bad Boys 2, a brutal, 2 1/2-hour display of production overkill."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,"Smith and Lawrence enjoyed some amusing chemistry in the '95 original, but their molecules sure aren't jibing here. It's a full hour into this behemoth before there's anything resembling a belly laugh."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,"The apotheosis of adolescent junk. Every sequence spews or splats carnage-filled effects. It's over-the-top, but not pleasurably so -- it's calculatedly over-the-top. The only way to get off on it is to revel in its prodigal waste of materiel."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,Appallingly mean-spirited.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,38,Bad Boys II is the rare case in which escapism involves leaving the theater.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,30,"Another Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay demonstration of spectacle -- noise, stunts, the aforementioned incoherent editing -- taking precedence over story and character... by far the most brutal American picture released this summer."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,30,The movie is so choppy in its nervous editing that a lot of the time we're simply watching senseless kinetic action.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,25,"It's basically the longest (a butt-numbing 21/2 hours), the most expensive (a reportedly obscene $150 million), most vulgar and by far the stupidest episode of ""Miami Vice"" ever."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,25,The vilest film of the season.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,25,"There's at least one ending too many, Union regularly vanishes for long stretches of the movie, and director Michael Bay's unmitigated pandering to viewers who whoop with glee whenever someone gets it between the eyes is genuinely distasteful."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,20,The only thing as bad as bad comedy is bad action. Bad Boys II has plenty of both.
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,12,"Bad Boys II has everything. Everything loud, dumb, violent, sexist, racist, misogynistic and homophobic that producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay can think of puking up onscreen."
Bad Boys II,6.6,138608444,0,"This putrid action flick crawls along for two and a half hours before expiring in a septic field of bad one-liners, halfhearted catchphrases, obliterated cars, vicious slow-motion bullet penetration, graphic corpse mutilations played for laughs, and shamefully hollow bonding scenes between its two dyspeptic megastars."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"Lively is an odd word for something called Dead Man's Chest, but lively it is. You won't find hotter action, wilder thrills or loopier laughs this summer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"It's too long, unnecessarily complicated and often silly, but Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is still the purest popcorn entertainment of the summer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"The slow, uneven beginning is more than compensated for by the rousing climax."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,Two of the big action set-pieces easily outdo anything from the previous edition.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,"It does deliver a combustible combination of ingredients for a summer blockbuster: a cornucopia of action and dazzling effects, some raucous humor and a large dose of Depp's winning charm."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,75,Sufficiently resembles the first film that the heartiest fans should be content.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,70,"Depp is the comic gel that holds the whole enterprise together. The performance is a total delight that somehow combines Bugs Bunny, Peter Pan and Charlie Chaplin."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,70,A collection of swashbuckling set pieces with the hustle of a vaudeville show.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,67,"Verbinski, Depp and company just want to make it the best ride you've had all summer. If that's all you demand of a frothy summer blockbuster, then this delivers the goods."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,67,The movie's gross-out effects are impressive but wearying. How apt that the director's name is Gore.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,67,"It's all a bit much, yes, a bit exhausting, that's true, but then why on earth would anyone expect otherwise?"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"This chest is overfilled with exposition and physical comedy, without a doubloon's worth of the scary suspense that made the laughs in the first one such brilliant comic relief."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"The summer's most anticipated film, and it gives fans what they want - then more of what they want, and more, and more, until gluttony becomes force-feeding."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"You can't beat on Dead Man's on value-for-money terms, but it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet -- everything's tasty, the surfeit is sickening."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,63,"Again, as with ""Star Wars,"" the interest lies at least as much in the set design and costumes as the narrative."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Too long, and too wrapped up in its various plot contrivances to notice it’s veering off course. But Jack just about pulls the wheel back, aided by Verbinski’s flair for cartoonish comedy action."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Even more of a party-hearty-Marty potlatch of silliness than its predecessor. The franchise having been established, Verbinski, Bruckheimer, and Co. have been liberated to indulge in absurdities, pile on the so-old-they're-new-again clichés, and make jokes at their own expense."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley manage to sparkle, but this overstuffed sequel is no treasure."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"Far too long, but thanks to Depp--and to Bill Nighy, properly mean beneath his suckers and blubber--it swerves away from the errors committed by the other big movies this summer."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,60,"The first of two sequels shot in immediate succession, Dead Man's Chest bears the unenviable burden of racking the pins for both movies, which leaves it with precious few opportunities to have a little fun of its own."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,58,There is a sense of bloat and where-do-we-go-from here aimlessness to this unconscionably protracted undertaking.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Intermittently fun and high-spirited, Dead Man's Chest sags under the weight of its own running time."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Dead Man's Chest is best summed up by the scene where Sparrow and Will battle each other atop a runaway water wheel. Like the characters, this movie is just running in circles."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"What do we want in a sequel? Just a little taste of the original or a triple serving piled high? Dead Man's Chest opts for the latter. This Disney movie isn't a follow-up to the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" so much as its empty-calorie clone."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"The worst kind of sequel -- the kind that exists only to give you more-more-more of what you liked the first time around, without ever justifying its own existence. This lavish, superbly designed film goes on for an exhausting 2½ hours."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"A long, tedious and convoluted follow-up to 2003's rollicking high-seas hit, The Curse of the Black Pearl, this second installment in the promised trilogy lacks the swash and buckle of the original. And then some."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"I was worn down by the excess: Depp's fruity impersonation of Keith Richards (or William F. Buckley) as pirate Jack Sparrow; too many bottomless chasms on an island with too many jungle savages (after the fashion of Peter Jackson's King Kong); Bill Nighy playing too squishy a villain with a beard of too many crawling octopus tentacles; too much violence, pop nihilism, and sick humor."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"The effects are breathtaking, and much of the action is choreographed with energy and wit. (A chase sequence on a cliff uses visual gags that defy the laws of physics, Wile E. Coyote-style.) But all of these moments bob on the film's slick surface like so much flotsam. Without a beating heart at its center, this Chest feels empty indeed."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Exactly the kind of thing most of us have in mind when we think ""popcorn movie."" It's largely brainless, pretty to look at, and produced solely as a lead-in to another moneymaking sequel for Disney."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,50,"Whatever goodwill one harbored toward the first Pirates film is quickly dashed by its sneering successor, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, which is less a film than a two-and-a-half-hour trailer for the final installment in this accidental trilogy."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,40,"Infernally boring for much of its running time, and then, just as the pulse starts to quicken: To be continued."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,40,A noisy and lazy stopgap movie that goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2 1/2 hours to get there.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,38,"Yes indeed, Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride, if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped, overstimulated but unsatisfied, and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,33,"The second movie, Dead Man's Chest, is everything you feared the first would be: a theme-park spectacle lasting 2 1/2 hours."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,7.3,423315812,33,More than the usual bad or even numbingly horrible movie. It's an amalgam of many of the modern cinema's worst tendencies and modern filmmaking's most unfortunate misconceptions.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,90,"Bigger, sleeker and better than the first, sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a joyride of a movie that takes the winning elements of the year 2000 hit to the next level."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,83,Let's face it: Chick power was never this yummy.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,80,"After The Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk, there's something refreshing about this movie's complete lack of intellectual pretense."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,75,"You may strain to recall just what happened an hour after you see it, but there are so many worse things to have to remember in life. It's a relief to focus on something so attractively amusing."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,75,The movie's glee is contagious.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,75,"The spike-heeled, postfeminist pajama-party sisterhood that is Charlie's Angels is back, and it's serious dress-up time."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,75,"This heavenly sequel, again directed by ""McG"" (aka Joseph McGinty Nichol), is infused with an irresistibly joyous spirit that simply cannot be faked."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,75,"Isn't only the silliest, most ridiculous movie of the summer; it may also be the most flat-out fun."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,70,"The main reason I enjoyed this high-powered action flick and its 2001 predecessor is their willingness to poke fun at the premise of crime-fighting dolls, even though it now has more currency than ever."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,70,"A loud and frequently funny clown show, Full Throttle is less a grim demolition derby than a day at Coney Island, punctuated by the clatter and screams of the Cyclone."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,70,"Harmless, brainless, good-natured fun."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,63,As insistent as it is skillful -- and it is very skillful -- it does all it can to pound you into enjoying yourself. The result is rather like being force-fed a meal of your favorite foods by the Terminator.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,60,"Full Throttle is full-throttle camp: It's like a third-rate Austin Powers picture cut to the whacking, attention-deficit-disorder tempo of ""Moulin Rouge."""
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,60,"It's flashy, it's often funny ...,and it resembles a movie so much that soon it demands something resembling motivation, character, a plot, anything to explain the seemingly arbitrary connections between the stunts and the skits."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,60,"All of the actresses are fun to watch, and as much attention appears to have been lavished on their outfits and hairdos as on their high-flying fight scenes."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,58,"The action is ridiculously overwrought, a state-of-the-art combination of CGI wizardry and Hong Kong-style wirework so removed from the laws of physical reality that it might as well be animated."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Its purpose is simply to allow you to soak up the happy grrrrl-power vibes of this easy-on-the-eyes trio amid unevenly executed computer-enhanced action scenes, at which points the movie resembles a video game."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Should have been either a whole lot worse or a whole lot better than it is: If it were worse, we could simply toss aside the things that are fun and entertaining about it and not even think twice. And if it were better -- well, we'd have fewer complaints all around."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,This is one of the silliest movies ever made--and lots of instantly forgettable fun.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"It worked once, but the novelty factor is gone. The cheese is still there, but this time it's overlaid with a cynical sense that the only reason the movie exists is because the first one made so much money."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Nothing deeper than a stale retread, it seems. And this is coming from a critic who listed the original ""Charlie's Angels"" movie as one of the top five films of 2000."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"The film is smart enough to know that verbal humor isn't its strong point, but it doesn't offer much in the way of compensation."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Clearly, this is something rare: a movie that insulates itself against its own rottenness by being lousy by design."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Proudly airheaded, incoherent, endlessly pandering - yet fitfully entertaining."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,So relentlessly giddy and hyperactive that it doesnt really need a movie review--it needs a prescription.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"A sequel whose sugar-rush absurdity almost defeats the forces of logic, taste and conventional narrative. It is a defect that might undermine a lesser movie but that in this case proves to be as cheerfully, enjoyably humid as the first blast of summer light and heat."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Tries to be bigger and better than the first ""Charlies Angels."" It achieves the bigger, but the better is sorely lacking."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,50,"Can't sustain its manic pitch, or work the McMiracle needed to overcome a script (credited to three writers, though more were no doubt afoot) that's less a story than a sales pitch."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,40,"There are only so many times you can see a slow-motion kickboxing scene or a figure sail off a skyscraper before you want to spend a nice, cozy evening with the Dead Sea Scrolls."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,40,"The shreds have vanished in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, which runs at that speed during its stunts but is utterly out of gas in every other way."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,38,"A less cohesive action-comedy than its predecessor, Full Throttle is instead a freewheeling collection of random action sequences strung together with little or no discernible rhyme or reason."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,38,That sense of fun is jackhammered into our skulls. The tongue that was so firmly in cheek last time has punctured through muscle and bone.
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"Two-hour exercise in chaotic action and coarse, annoyingly coy sexuality."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"What fans of the original movie, ""Charlie's Angels,"" which was fun and good-natured, will make of this sloppy mess is hard to guess."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"Something cold and mechanical has seeped into the sequel. The divas push so hard for fun, it kills the spontaneity that fun needs to breathe."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,30,"Isn't a full-bodied comedy, and it isn't a bona fide action movie, either. It just makes a facetious spectacle of itself."
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,4.9,100830111,25,"As for me, watching this overripe, ignorant parading of Hollywood privilege an hubris put me in mind of a different song--Neil Young's ""Revolution Blues."" Specifically the bit about Laurel Canyon being filled with famous stars . . ."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,80,This hugely entertaining oddity could never be mistaken for the work of any other filmmaker.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,75,"It’s a good sci-fi action movie, too. Far be it from me to give this movie the kiss of death by making it seem too serious for its core audience. Chappie is everything it has to be — but it’s everything it should be, too."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,75,"Between the charming Copley performance, the ingenious visuals, the absolutely incredible all-electronic Hans Zimmer score (seriously, this is one of his best ever), and the propulsive narrative thrust (Blomkamp is rarely singled out for how swiftly he moves things along, plot holes be damned), there is a lot to appreciate and even love about Chappie."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,70,"There's something fearlessly uncool about the film, which suffers mostly from being made 30 years too late."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,67,"With a titanium body and a child's mind, Chappie is a fascinating figure, vividly rendered, enough so that you wish there was a better movie around him."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,63,This is a well-meaning film with a good idea that unfortunately stumbles on its way to its less-than-satisfying end.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,63,"Chappie boasts so many entertaining elements, particularly the lead motion-capture performance by Blomkamp’s go-to guy Sharlto Copley, its shortcomings don’t sink the movie."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,63,"Chappie is meant to inspire questions about what it means to be human, and at times it does. However, director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp doesn't explore its intriguing premise deeply enough."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Even at his shakiest, Mr. Blomkamp holds your attention with stories about characters banding together to emerge from a hell not of their own making, a liberation journey that just isn’t the same old, same old when a director was born in South Africa."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Like its title character, Chappie is stunning to behold and easy to like, but it’s still some way from fully developed."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Blomkamp’s third movie has just about enough spectacle and quirk to overcome some fairly major flaws, not least of which is an unappealing central trio."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"Chappie is a broad, brash picture, which does not allow itself to get bogged down in arguing about whether or not “artificial intelligence” is possible. It has subversive energy and fun."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,60,"It’s a brawny, inventive action romp that’s as happy firing rockets at helicopters as it is contemplating the Cartesian model of mind-body dualism, which gives it a satisfying, sweet-and-sour tang of its own."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Now, with Chappie, the director/co-writer returns home for an uneven showcase of impeccable visual effects and lackluster emotional affect."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Criminally underwritten characters result in actors like Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) having little to do."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"When we’re first introduced, he’s an overwhelmed infant, and by the time the credits roll, he’s John McClane. Is that an accurate representation of how artificial intelligence can evolve? Absolutely. Does it make for compelling drama? Not particularly."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Chappie has a nothing-to-lose Roger Cormanesque quality about it, low on budget (except for the CGI robots) and low on meaning, but full of high-velocity chases, helicopter pursuits, and weapons blasting around empty warehouses marred by graffiti and trash."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"A movie about a robot policeman given a childlike conscience, Chappie is one of those incongruous Franken-films that’s simultaneously bombastically brutal and treacly. Like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial crossed with Transformers, or RoboCop starring Jar Jar Binks, it’s a recipe guaranteed to produce aesthetic indigestion."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"The technology is seamless, the movements are eloquent and the problem may be my own misprogramming, but the robot still looked to me like a man in a robot suit."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Chappie feels like Blomkamp and his co-writer Terri Tatchell had three or four different films they wanted to make, and instead of figuring out which one actually worked, they just made them all at the same time."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Like ""Elysium,"" this rusty A.I. story is basically just ""District 9"" with a new coat of paint; it’s distinguished only by the jabbering, irritating personality of its title character."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"Blomkamp regular Sharlto Copley is quite good — as Chappie, in a motion-capture performance. (He also provides the voice of the robot.) If this were somehow a commentary on man's increasing lack of humanity or something, that would be fine. Instead, it's just good work buried inside a movie made up of intriguing ideas that never really go anywhere."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,50,"While it has a few appealing qualities, as a whole it amounts to a well-intentioned bag of missed opportunities."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,42,"The movie's glaring problem is the design and execution of Chappie, whose look is unremarkable except for a pair of polymer rabbit ears ready for meme posterity."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,"Chappie is as subtle as a sledgehammer. The latest sci-fi action spectacle from “District 9” and “Elysium” director Neill Blomkamp is also sprawling, bombastic, deafening, ugly and ultra-violent."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,"It never winds up with anything particularly interesting or effective to say about life, intelligence, religion, the nature of consciousness, or any of the other big themes it deliberately evokes. It does, however, blow up a lot of stuff."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,"Chappie is a bucket of bolts, Blomkamp’s desire to say meaningful things outdistancing his ability to say them compellingly."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,40,It’s too bad that neither the philosophy nor the pyrotechnics on-screen in Chappie can distract you from your own sinking feeling that you’ve seen almost all of this before.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,38,"Blomkamp and his wife and co-writer, Terri Tatchell, stack the deck. Instead of awe, we get ""E.T."" - aww."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,37,"Despite Blomkamp’s efforts to make some kind of commentary about the human soul, which the auteur bolsters with his trademark social consciousness — a tone of preachiness that, after three films, has worn out its welcome — the movie exhibits precious little humanity."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,30,"It’s not just that Chappie is a mishmash of familiar ingredients whose story quickly slides off the rails into a swamp of action-movie clichés, or another misbegotten project from the Land of Intriguing Premises. It doesn’t have an intriguing premise in the first place. It’s cluttered, goofy and incoherent from beginning to end, and much too long."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,30,"With unappealing one-note characters, retread concepts and implausible motivations, Chappie is a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,30,"Intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is one of the major casualties of Chappie, a robot-themed action movie that winds up feeling as clunky and confused as the childlike droid with which it shares its name."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,An exhausting slog through overly familiar cliches that is nowhere near as profound or touching as it clearly thinks it is and is utterly lacking in the kind of intelligence and artistry that it so often pays lip service to in the dialogue.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,"“Short Circuit” meets “RoboCop” — with asides to “WALL-E,” “E.T.,” “The Road Warrior” and many other better movies — in Chappie, an interminable, violent, incoherent and wearying R-rated sci-fi action comedy."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,"The film's exasperating atonality washes out any legitimate idea about identity, education, nature versus nurture, or artificial intelligence that Neill Blomkamp hoped to evince."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,25,"Wrongheaded in conception, eye-rolling in execution, Chappie is a childish blend of the cute robot goofiness of “Short Circuit,” and the bloody-minded mayhem of “Robocop.” Neill Blomkamp, the director of “District 9,” has utterly exhausted his supply of South African sci-fi ideas with this disaster, an excruciating two hours of your life you will fear, quite rightly, ever getting back."
Chappie,6.8,31569268,20,Chappie is a movie about the evolution of artificial intelligence that's as dumb as a post. It also marks the continuing devolution of the work of director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp.
Chappie,6.8,31569268,0,A misjudgment from metallic head to titanium toe.
Commando,6.7,35100000,70,"In Commando, the fetching surprise is the glancing humor between the quixotic and larky Rae Dawn Chong and the straight-faced killing machine of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Chong lights up the film like a firefly, Schwarzenegger delivers a certain light touch of his own, the result is palatable action comics."
Commando,6.7,35100000,63,"Though not as good as Terminator, the film has a better-than-usual script for this sort of thing and shows a lot of humor. Schwarzenegger isn't especially good as an actor, but his presence is impressive, and he is beginning to show some style, if not much substance. For action fans, one of the picks of the litter for the year."
Commando,6.7,35100000,63,"Comic book stuff, helped out by the presence of Rae Dawn Chong as an airline stewardess whose sarcastic commentary adds some comic counterpoint to the deliberately overscaled action."
Commando,6.7,35100000,60,Two-thirds of this 90-minute film is mayhem unrelieved by humor and untouched by humanity.
Commando,6.7,35100000,50,"Lots of machine-gunfire, explosions and disposable khaki-clad extras, as you'd expect."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,70,The car chases are unimpeachable.
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,67,"With more sophisticated writing, one suspects they could really soar: Even here, slowed by clunky, character-establishing lines and an all-devouring plot, they hit more often than they miss."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"But the bad boys achieve something a budget can't buy: an easy, natural rapport that makes you root for them. For comedy and thrills, Lawrence and Smith are a dream team."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"We've seen it all a million times before, but there are abundant (foul-mouthed) funnies, and debut director Michael Bay shows his commercials expertise propelling the noisy nonsense into a frantically slick and thoroughly enjoyable extravaganza."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,63,"Crucially, the teaming of standup favorite and ""Martin"" star Lawrence and ""Fresh Prince"" Smith clicks from the outset, with both right at home handling action and comedy on the bigscreen. Even when it's not particularly funny, their interplay is engaging, and their lively, raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,"Would have been better if it had been sleeker and shorter. After all, this film isn't aiming for high-toned drama, just high-energy entertainment, which is what it delivers."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,"The flabbergasting scenes here-written by a team of ""Tonight Show"" and ""David Letterman Show"" writers and directed by hot, young TV-commercial and music-video director Michael Bay-are slick, fast, loud, mostly derived from other movies and often senseless."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,60,Whom do they make these movies for? What exercise in self-deception inspires them to go to such effort and expense for what is obviously going to be a lame exercise in retreadmanship?
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Aside from the racial twist, this is pretty conventional fare, but it's consistently diverting."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Though audiences will leave theaters with an increased appreciation of this pair's talents, they will also leave pondering the perennial Hollywood question: How come so little of interest could be found for performers who are capable of so much more?"
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Benefits from Smith and Lawrence's chemistry. As long as they're on screen together, things breeze along. But when they're apart, the movie flounders."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"There's only so far a movie can go on loud music, nicely-framed shots, testosterone, and adrenaline. Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,It's like a series of cliches exploding in your face.
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks, this one's bad, boys."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"From the swooping aerial shots of downtown Miami, to the long, long-legged beauties that seem to crop up every time the action threatens to slow down, to the nonsensical lack of logic that permeates the film like the acrid odor of wasted cordite, Bad Boys oozes Eighties Hollywood clichés like no film since ""Top Gun."""
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,50,"Relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; it's loud, shallow, sexist and a complete waste of time."
Bad Boys,6.9,65807024,42,Formulaic sass machine... I was writhing in my seat.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,83,"In an era of high-falutin’ tentpole sci-fi, there’s something to be said for a filmmaker still devoted to crafting plain old genre pleasures."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,"It’s nothing new for sure, but writer/director David Twohy...throws in enough entertaining touches to maintain interest — despite an overlong two-hour running time."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,Riddick isn't perfect but it's a good high-octane sci-fi tinged action/thriller.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,"The quickest and easiest way to humanize an unlikeable movie character is to give him a lovable dog, and so it goes with Riddick."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,75,"It's fun! Extremely violent, cleverly managed fun, full of eviscerating aliens."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,70,"There’s one man alone, stranded on a seemingly desolate distant planet with only his wits, his fists and his voice-over.  That voice-over is mercifully spare, the landscape atmospherically barren and the action nice and tight."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,70,"An improbable but very enjoyable sequel that recaptures much of the stripped-down intensity of Diesel and director David Twohy’s franchise starter ""Pitch Black."""
Riddick,6.4,42025135,67,"While ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was an overstuffed melange of CGI and unnecessary subplots, Riddick is a far more streamlined affair, and all the better for it."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,67,"Riddick, as a character, is best when he's alone, fighting against insurmountable odds, with narratives that serve his singular nastiness."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,64,"Riddick is a fractured skeleton of a script, with each distinct installment scratching its own itch."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,63,"The movie jogs along nicely without ever getting a case of the stupids; far from being a bloated “John Carter,” it’s just a pared-down yarn of survival: “Die Hard” on a planet."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,63,"Riddick can be cheesy and silly, not to mention excessively violent, but it’s also fun."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,63,Twohy's script contains macho dialogue so ripe it's embarrassing to hear it.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Riddick taps into a primal well of audience wish-fulfillment, but over the course of its unrelieved, monotonous length, it does its best to suck that well dry."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Riddick aims much lower than the stars and still doesn't quite hit its target. But when you consider a summer overstuffed with disappointing prestige pics that cost the GDP of several island nations to produce, Riddick's more modest (and less expensive) stumbling doesn't seem so bad in comparison."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Watching this see-in-the-dark muscleman brooding against gorgeous otherworldly vistas, all while crafting pointy homemade weapons and befriending a scene-stealing CGI canine (no joke), is a sci-fi aficionado's delight."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,60,"Overlong and often overcooked, this is nevertheless a relative return to form for Diesel as the fiendish Furyan."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,58,"At a time when the budgets for sci-fi films are, like the universe itself, expanding at an astronomical rate, Riddick decides to go small."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"This is back-to-basics stuff, which turns out to be not such a bad idea."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,An alternately kick-ass and clumsy piece of sci-fi claptrap that puts its empty head down and gets the job done.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"Purely as an action film, Riddick is passable, if grueling. The problem is tonal."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"The results are by turns boring and bizarre, although Diesel still has some presence."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,50,"Playing it safe with a script that offers Riddick up as a lone avenging hero, Twohy passes on the opportunity to effectively shade the character’s distinctive dimensionality."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"Too stodgy for B-movie suspense, too silly to shock, too sexist to stomach, Diesel’s return misfires."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"The aliens are unscary and easily despatched, Vin’s too silent to be interesting, and the other characters – a gang of bounty hunters on Riddick’s trail – are either dull or offensive."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"Like Vin Diesel, it has bulk, lumbering clumsily along as it repeats Diesel’s greatest hits — the ones that don’t require him to drive a fast and furious car."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,40,"As a result, we get relatively little insight into the other characters as they react to Riddick. Without an unknown force to spark our own imaginations, the result is mostly dead air."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,38,"The only reason to root for Riddick is that his name is on the ticket stub. But he's so dull and the hunters so weird that we're literally cheering for the movie to kill off its personality, one throat slash at a time."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,30,"Move along, there's nothing to see and no one to root for in this murky franchise reboot."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,30,"It's the film, though, that remains handcuffed. The early part of the story -- with Riddick stranded on an unfriendly planet -- is taut enough, but hampered by flagrantly unreal effects and Diesel's punch-drunk narration."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,25,The entire movie bears the whiff of a vanity project — a modestly budgeted bone Universal Pictures threw at Diesel so he would keep starring in Fast and Furious pictures. Those movies are bank; Riddick is rank.
Riddick,6.4,42025135,25,"For a film about a killing machine who can see at night, it's fittingly ironic that the film itself is, both narratively and visually, a dark, muddled mess."
Riddick,6.4,42025135,25,"The story feels like quicksand. Riddick, which couldn’t even qualify for proper summer movie placement, moves like Martian molasses and can’t present an action scene to save its life. You’ll wish you had Uncle Martin’s ability to speed people — not to mention awful movies — up."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,70,"A mish-mash of accents (buffoonish Depardieu's French, somber Irons' British, and DiCaprio and Malkovich carrying the same voices they use for every project) are vaguely unsettling, and there seems to be too little swashbuckling for characters who are synonymous with the term."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,70,"An unusually sober and serious-minded telling of Alexandre Dumas' classic tale, this handsome costumer is routinely made and comes up rather short in boisterous excitement."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,67,"Wallace, unfortunately, writes lazy, anachronistic dialogue, and the picture is abysmally shot (by Peter Suschitzky), with a prosaic, low-budget look that never allows you to experience the enraptured majesty of a fairy-tale historical setting."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,63,"I could see how, with a rewrite and a better focus, this could have been a film of ""Braveheart'' quality instead of basically just a costume swashbuckler."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,63,"The result is the kind of picture you can sit through quite contentedly, the cinematic equivalent of an innocuous seatmate on an airplane trip -- it neither bores nor insults you, and, when the ride's over, is promptly gone and forgotten."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,63,"The problem with this movie is that Wallace has attempted to squeeze a 500-page book into a 130-minute motion picture, something that can't be done without major sacrifices."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,60,"Beyond its persistent coarseness, Wallace's story often trades yesterday's inspiration (Dumas) for today's (Simpson-Bruckheimer)."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,60,"Heavy on swordplay and spectacle, it's so intent on reviving the costume epics of the past it doesn't realize it's trying to be too many things to too many people until it collapses under its own weight."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Thoroughly second-rate -- which is to say that it waddles when it ought to whiz, clanks when it strives for cornball poetry, and transforms its august stars into something akin to a manic dinner-theater troupe."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"The only other adaptations I've seen of the Alexandre Dumas novel (which I haven't read) are the Classics Illustrated comic book and the 1939 James Whale potboiler, both of which I prefer to this vulgar and overwrought 1998 free-for-all, which makes you wait interminably for the story's central narrative premise."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Going down with the Titanic was a picnic compared to what Leonardo DiCaprio has to weather (an Alice in Wonderland hairdo, for starters) as Louis XIV in this unwittingly nutso adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' 1850 novel."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,There is nothing worth getting steamed over or particularly excited about.
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Viewers expecting rip-roaring, chandelier- swinging swordplay adventure are likely to be disappointed by the measured tone and portentous verbal interplay."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,50,"Leonardo DiCaprio? Excuse me, Leonardo DiCaprio? I know he makes teenaged girls cry, but, I mean, Leonardo DiCaprio?"
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,40,"This dopey swashbuckler offers little action but lashings of DiCaprio's soft, hairless flesh."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,40,"This new chronicle of the adventures of the king's musketeers, as directed by Braveheart scribe Randall Wallace, suffers from a severe case of over-earnestness and star-power overkill."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,40,"The Three Musketeers, a rusty trio of middle-aged retirees, have all but changed their motto from ""All for one and one for all"" to ""I have fallen and I can't get up"" in this less-than-rollicking adaptation."
The Man in the Iron Mask,6.5,56968902,10,"Not 10 minutes into the smeary mess that is The Man in the Iron Mask, the only sensible question to ask yourself is, ""What am I doing here?"""
They Live,7.3,13008928,91,The terrors put forth by the film are at once specific to the era of its production and timeless in their direct connection to the American experience.
They Live,7.3,13008928,80,"They Live is, to scramble its most famous line, better at chewing bubblegum than kicking ass."
They Live,7.3,13008928,75,"A fantastically subversive film, a nifty little confection pitting us vs them, the haves vs the have-nots."
They Live,7.3,13008928,70,"Carpenter is trying for a satire of advertising and consumerism under late capitalism, and although the film is great fun at first--especially when depicting the world through Nada's glasses--it rarely rises above the intellectual level of a comic book."
They Live,7.3,13008928,70,"All in all, an entertaining (if ideologically incoherent) response to the valorization of greed in our midst, with lots of Rambo-esque violence thrown in, as well as an unusually protracted slugfest between ex-wrestler Roddy Piper and costar Keith David."
They Live,7.3,13008928,70,"The plot for They Live is full of black holes, the acting is wretched, the effects are second-rate. In fact, the whole thing is so preposterous it makes ""V"" look like ""Masterpiece Theatre."" [5 Nov 1988]"
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,80,"With few words and the odd squint, Cruise hard boils all of his charisma into a clenched fist, but is more than happy to let a dynamic Smulders take the lead in many scenes."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,80,"Overall, a superior sequel. Some people will never get over the height discrepancy but character-wise, Never Goes Back brings Reacher closer to the books for the type of thriller that rarely gets made these days."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"Somehow, Reacher gets under your skin with his mordant wit, razor-sharp intelligence, and existentialist intensity."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"This is a superior and assured action movie, a quality product that makes the case for a franchise."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,75,"Cruise finds the core of Reacher in his eyes, with a haunted gaze that says this lone wolf is still on a mission and still a long way from home. That's the Reacher Lee Child created in his books. And Cruise does him proud."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"This Reacher outing has its imperfections and its obstacles to overcome, but the strength of the character and the briskness of the action make it acceptable if you are in the mood."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"With all the action movies that have come before, it's tough to make car chases and fist fights seem original and exciting, but fortunately, there's enough of a story to keep things interesting even when you might feel a sense of déjà vu."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,70,"Never Go Back could have used a bit more personality in the bad guy department, and the middle section sags a bit before the inevitable (and satisfying) denouement. But everyone involved seems to understand exactly what kind of movie they’re trying to make, and they deliver on just about every promise made by the title Jack Reacher: Never Go Back."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,63,It all makes for competent but routine suspense.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,62,"It’s nothing special, but it’s nothing awful, either."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"It shouldn’t seem shocking, but the most interesting thing about this second Cruise-fired action film based on author Lee Child’s nomadic, ex-military hero is its action."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"If Zwick’s film improves on Christopher McQuarrie's inaugural, incoherent 2012 entry in the series, it's not through any special initiative on the film's part. But it's efficient, unfussy, and doesn't try to think any faster than it can run."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is always faintly diverting but never particularly engrossing, putting the venerable movie star through his paces without really asking much of him."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,60,"There is no juicy high-concept baddie this time around, but there is a lot of enjoyable hokum and cheerful ridiculousness."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"The movie is lighter, more fun, and ultimately more satisfying than its weighty predecessor."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"There’s no mystery, and the action is thoroughly disposable, but what works this time around are the interactions between Reacher and Turner, mostly thanks to the efforts of Smulders, who brings an impassioned frustration to her character."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Tom Cruise may be an A-list action star, but the Jack Reacher films are beginning to feel like the B-movies of his career."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,The first scene in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back promises something interesting but delivers something considerably less. That’s a problem with the whole movie.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"The latest Reacher film is directed, with reasonable skill and no trace of personality, by Edward Zwick, based on a screenplay taken from the 18th novel. I wish I had more dynamic news to report, but contrary to Reacher's own violent tendencies, some things in life and the movies practically defy a strong reaction."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"When it works, it works. But if this character and this franchise are to survive, “Never Go Back” needs to be a promise Reacher makes — about ever playing a parent again."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a major step backward with an A-list actor in a C-grade military thriller.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"It’s a pity that Jack Reacher: Never Go Back fails to support Cruise and his co-stars, all of whom are acting as if their lives depended on it. There’s a great movie buried somewhere in here—a strange but beguiling family comedy and a meditation on nature vs. nurture, with a bit of shooting and punching thrown in—but the filmmakers never figure out how to excavate it."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"It’s two solid hours of disposable, forgettable action-thriller filmmaking with a competent Cruise performance in the middle."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Like its predecessor it’s an unremarkable placeholder until the next ""Mission: Impossible"" flick comes along."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"With anybody other than a superstar like Tom Cruise in the title role, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back would just be a routine potboiler. With superstar Tom Cruise in the title role, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is … a routine potboiler."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,50,"Tom Cruise is as muscly and bland as heroes come, restrained by the burden of two dead-weight companion pawns. Jack Reacher is a man who thrives on working alone, and this dull tale of backstabbing militant leeches proves that fact tenfold."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is harmlessly generic.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back isn’t a throwaway, and mainstream action/thriller fans should come out more than satisfied at the visceral nature of the film. But anyone hoping for more than a superficial on-the-run chase movie will probably wish Reacher had stayed home, instead of going back."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,42,"Cruise’s undeniable star power is all that keeps “Never Go Back” from feeling like it came off a studio assembly line, though you’ll still spend most of the movie wondering if you’ve been swindled into watching a movie about Ethan Hunt’s luddite twin brother."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"As a thriller, it’s lethargically paced, uninspiringly edited, and hardly raises your pulse even during life-or-death mano-a-mano."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"The result is a well-executed but stubbornly formulaic crime thriller that telegraphs most of its major surprises long before they ever happen. It's not a bad movie, mind you. It's just one that will strike viewers as exceedingly familiar, and as generic as that say-nothing title."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the second movie that Tom Cruise has starred in as this title character. Let’s hope it’s the last.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Never Go Back is boilerplate action-thriller, filmed with an anonymous style and scripted so that characters talk in catchphrases."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Sometimes the film’s frenetic pace works, as in a brutally efficient half-second fight in an airplane bathroom. But more often, it feels like cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Billy Weber are feuding."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"By-the-numbers plotting, seen-it-all-before action moves, banal locations and a largely anonymous cast alongside the star give this a low-rent feel."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,40,"Zwick barely manages to tickle our adrenaline, waiting till the climactic showdown amid a New Orleans Halloween parade to deliver a sequence that could legitimately register as memorable."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"But hey, at least Zwick and company carve out some time for Tom Cruise to run, with Reacher dashing across a busy avenue for about 18 seconds or so. It’ll make for a great supercut one day."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"Unfortunately, as with too many films being made with the international market in mind, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a jumble of overhyped action scenes, trite dialogue, painfully bad “character development”, and awful writing."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,The whole thing is just so sloppy and dumb and overflowing with clichés.
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"You cannot always judge movies by their titles, but you sometimes get good advice. The sequel Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, supplies its own five-word review."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,38,"The visual blandness of Edward Zwick’s style and the simplistic, easily solved case is better suited for television."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,25,"Of course, action movies don’t have to be believable or poignant. They just have to get your adrenaline pumping. But the movie lacks inspiration in that department, too, owing to action sequences you’ve seen before, familiar music and dialogue so predictable you could make a game out of guessing the next line."
Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,6.1,58697076,25,"Even as a star text, it’s shoddy."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,91,"The film explores the way propaganda is used to set the stage for a conflict, and considering this is a mainstream franchise aimed primarily at young audiences, it's actually a pretty interesting take on how image matters as much as action in a media age."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,90,"A penultimate chapter without a real ending, but it’s also a thrilling ride full of potent emotions, new characters and major twists of fate, built around another commanding star performance."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,88,It's easily the most political of the three films. It also is the most absorbing and best in the series.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,83,"With Mock 1, the Hunger Games franchise continues to entertain and evolve, not perfectly but smartly, so we can't wait to see what's next. That's what counts when all is said, done and deposited in the bank."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,83,"Suffice it to say that while Mockingjay, Part 1 might not be as consistently thrilling as “Catching Fire” — the second movie always has the luxury of being all PB&J and no crust — it's the movie equivalent of a page-turner, consistently suspenseful and filled with surprises and illuminating character moments."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"The trifecta of Lawrence, Moore, and Hoffman is the movie’s driving force, from both a plot and performance perspective. Together, they imbue Mockingjay with a sense of gravity and significance befitting its tough themes."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"A part with this much sobbing, hand-wringing, and mournful gazing into the middle distance could be, in the wrong hands, a laugh riot, but Lawrence’s instincts are so smart that she never goes even a shade overboard. She’s a hell of an actress."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"While it definitely takes its foot off the action, Mockingjay – Part 1 goes deeper and darker."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,80,"With measure and muscle, Lawrences Jennifer and Francis nail the job of selling the long, twisting road towards revolution."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"If Mockingjay - Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,This installment substitutes psychological action for physical thrills.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"What's missing from Mockingjay - Part 1 is a strong through-story. The previous films were characterized by engrossing, well-constructed story arcs but Mockingjay - Part 1 meanders."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Although it doesn’t make a lick of sense as a stand-alone story, Mockingjay — Part 1 is the first “Hunger Games” movie with meat on its bones."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Dark, grim and exciting entertainment."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Delivers the dazzle without sacrificing the smarts. The suspense is killer. Ditto the thrill of the hunt. The film uses the extra time to, of all things, develop characters and give this dystopian fable a human scale."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Not everything in “Mockingjay” is dynamic or remarkable. Director Lawrence, working from Peter Craig and Danny Strong's screenplay, occasionally mistakes somnambulance for solemnity."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"Ultimately, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 serves as solid if unspectacular first lap around the track of a two-lap race."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"As a metaphor for the way we respond to the media, and the way our politics are funneled through the media lens, the film succeeds most when it revels in ambiguity."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,75,"It's rare to see any blockbuster in any genre make decisions informed and driven by character, rather than by the more superficial requirements of blockbuster entertainment, but the rewards in that regard are plentiful in Mockingjay."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"As smart as this film is about image-making in the age of all-pervasive media, the theme threatens to wear thin until Katniss comes to a new and moving awareness of her power, not just as a figurehead fashioned and elaborately feathered by political consultants but as a source of authentic inspiration to her shattered nation."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"If Mockingjay’s placeholder status is a little too evident in its choppy, shapeless structure, this dark third chapter does have stretches of somber beauty."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"The script for Mockingjay Part 1, credited to Peter Craig and Danny Strong, gets the job done, but the performers matter far more than the words they deliver."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,Director Francis Lawrence does a nice job capturing the claustrophobic environment of District 13 and has a good eye for action shots. But the actors are what really sell the movie.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"If you break the script down into plot points, it sounds a little silly: The narrative thrust is simply Katniss shooting several pro-revolution commercials. But it works because we're fascinated by media fights — thousands occur online every day."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,70,"For all its obvious smarts and mildly provocative ideas, Mockingjay doesn’t seem to trust its audience quite as much as it clearly trusts its heroine."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,67,"It’s good for business but bad for drama, and the inelegantly titled Mockingjay—Part 1 suffers from an unavoidable sense of anticlimax. It doesn’t build to an ending so much as just eventually grind to a halt, like a video game demanding more quarters to continue playing."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,67,"The biggest problem with the new Hunger Games movie is right there in the title: Part 1. Mockingjay, the final installment in Suzanne Collins' best-selling YA trilogy, wasn't conceived in two parts."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,63,"The problem is, for all its surface intelligence, ""Mockingjay, Part 1"" has little depth, and that sometimes makes it much more frustrating than a more knowingly shallow and silly movie might have been."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,63,"It’s a joyless, surpassingly dour enterprise, but one that fulfills its mission with Katniss’s own eagle-eyed efficiency and unsentimental somberness."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"Though everyone tries her or his hardest to make it otherwise, this is by definition a place-holder film that exists not so much for itself but to smooth the transition from its hugely successful predecessors to a presumably glorious finale one year hence."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"The drama and tone are powerful and effective and Lawrence makes an exceptionally charismatic heroine, but an almost total lack of action means this is less catching fire than treading water."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"Director Francis Laurence ekes a paltry story out. The special effects are limp and the script a little creaky, although somehow it still manages to thrill."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,Collins' revolutionary-lite rhetoric has become unravelled by the commercially driven decision to split the final novel into two films - ultimately lessening the satirical bite and reverting to the very gender archetypes it originally sought to challenge.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,60,"Mockingjay – Part 1 is all queue, no roller-coaster. The third of four films in the successful and admirable Hunger Games series is any number of good things: intense, stylish, topical, well-acted. But the one thing it could never be called is satisfying."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,58,"The best part of ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is when Katniss sings ""The Hanging Tree."""
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"That makes Mockingjay – Part 1 an experience to be endured, like a prison sentence, rather than enjoyed. By all means, bring on the revolution: It has to be more exciting than this."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"As it is, “Mockingjay,” a big bore, suffers from being the transitional event before the big showdown."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"It’s a cheat, a cash grab, and it makes for 125 dystopian minutes of set-up with no resolution. But come back next November, folks, and we’ll show you the rest! They should have called it “Mockingjay, Part 1 — The Shakedown.” Or “The Hunger Games 3: Rubble Without a Cause.”"
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"The movie lumbers on some more, reiterating the obvious and relying on overfamiliar imagery. Audiences have a long year to wait for Part 2. Would it not have been better to leave them breathless than heaving a sigh?"
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"It’s not a bad film, this first-half of the concluding chapter of “The Hunger Games.” But it is, from first scene to last, just a tedious good-looking set-up for what one might hope would be a more lively, and perhaps better lit and ventilated finale."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"Though we still believe that Lawrence, who turned 25 in August, can do no wrong, she isn’t given much opportunity to do anything spectacularly right here. Her performance is a medley of sobs and gasps, in mournful or radiant closeup. This time, her Katniss is as much a prisoner of her circumstances as Peeta is. She and the movie are both victims of burnout."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,50,"Unfortunately, Mockingjay — Part 1 has all the personality of an industrial film. There's not a drop of insolence, insubordination or insurrection running through its veins; it feels like a manufactured product through and through, ironic and sad given its revolutionary theme."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,40,"With no real beginning and no real ending, the unsatisfying ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is essentially all middle -- one big, stretched out, watered-down second act. The result is a handsome film, but also a talky one that takes a while to hit its storytelling stride and that, once there, repeatedly stalls to fill time."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,40,"There is a serious lack of action here, which might be overlooked if the script were as smart as in the previous films. What passes for parable here is merely overplotting."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,38,Hopefully Jennifer Lawrence will actually be given something worthwhile to do next time around. That would actually be worth paying to see.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,337135885,25,"Only in the movie business could someone sell such shoddy merchandise and expect people to buy it. If The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 were an appliance, it would be a broken toaster that people would toss in the garbage. Except that analogy is too kind, in that “Mockingjay” would be half a toaster."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,63,"Thankfully, Reynolds (bearded, looking a bit like Jason Lee) adds some scrappiness and humor to a series that might otherwise have collapsed under self-parody."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,63,"I don't know if it was intentional, but Drake seems to come out of the same sandy hole in which our troops found the cowering Saddam Hussein."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,60,Should reasonably please fans of the genre before assuming its place in the horror section of your local video store.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,60,"Won't linger in the memory long, but gives pretty good action eye-candy while it's going."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,60,"Has the great sleek, dark look of its predecessors and, most important, it has Snipes."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,60,"This Trinity may be the least of the three--sound familiar, Matrix faithful?--but it's the closest in style and attitude to a pulpy comic book, an art form that doesn't need to be lofty, perfect or even sensible to tickle a dork's fancy."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,58,"Blunt-witted, visually pedestrian, and overly long, with too many scenes of Blade and his cohorts standing around in darkened corridors, waiting for their enemies to show up. The action, however, is as throat-grabbing as you want it to be."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"Director Goyer, who wrote all three Blade films, deserves credit for sticking with the character, but aside from the effectively staged action sequences Trinity is cheap-looking and laughably inept."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"Swimming in computer-enhanced mayhem and a non-stop hip-hop-and-techno soundtrack, Blade: Trinity might as well come equipped with joysticks attached to the seats, so everyone can play along."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"The only one who seems to be having much fun is Parker Posey, camping it up as one of the vampires."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"What redeems the film...is that for every nonstop explosion, there's a hilarious burst of Reynolds' nonstop patter."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,But there's just enough comforting familiarity mixed with refreshing new characters to hold the casserole of a plot together.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,The story is a comic-book tale at its most basic level.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,"One of the prime laws of the multiplex states that any action or horror movie series will devolve into ritualized violence, self-mocking camp, and egregious silliness by part three. Blade: Trinity is right on schedule."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,50,Big and dumb and loud and entirely past its prime.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,42,"Has a surprising number of problems: dire scripting, sloppy plotting and coffee-jittery editing, for starters. But its biggest problem is that Blade himself takes a back seat to a host of new and mostly uninteresting characters."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,40,"A choppy, forgetful, suspense-free romp that substitutes campy humor for chills."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,40,"By and large, the jokes fall flat, and the entire film often seems as fatigued as its star."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,38,"Take away the film's attitude, and you're left with ""Son of Van Helsing."""
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,38,Dull Blade just doesn't cut it.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,38,"Kris Kristofferson, as a scaled-down old gray mentor to Blade, still looks like the visual equivalent of your five worst college hangovers."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,38,"A mess. It lacks the sharp narrative line and crisp comic-book clarity of the earlier films, and descends too easily into shapeless fight scenes that are chopped into so many cuts that they lack all form or rhythm."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,30,There's nothing beneath the flashy editing and self-consciously cool production design but a soulless adrenaline machine that's never scary and rarely engrossing.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,30,"The movie is loud, dark, bumpy and not even a little fun. You emerge into daylight bruised and battered, suffering a case of movie abuse."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,30,Offers neither horror nor style.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,25,Sucky vampire flick.
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,25,"Dracula, who, as played by Dominic Purcell, has all the dark charisma and burning threat of a baked potato."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,25,"No, it's the movie itself -- an unimaginative, generic affair memorable only for its incessant and flagrant plugging of Apple computers and iPods -- that should put a stake through the franchise for good."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,20,"If ever there was a case for quitting while you're behind, this ""Blade"" is it -- ready to be buried in a vat of garlic."
Blade: Trinity,5.9,52411906,20,"Of all the missteps made and absurdities offered, the most glaring is the casting of what appears to be a steroidal Eurotrash pimp as no less than Dracula."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"The film forges ahead, in vivid 3-D, with such energy, expertise and thunderous conviction that you readily accept its basic premise — the pell-mell emergence of great intelligence, plus moral awareness, in primitive bodies — and find yourself exactly where the filmmakers want you to be, swinging giddily between sympathy for the apes and the humans in what threatens to become all-out war."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is awe-inspiring.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"Yet for all of the technological genius at work here, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes maintains a remarkably human core, even under digital makeup."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"""Dawn"" is not just a good genre movie or a good summer movie. It's a great science-fiction film, full-stop, and one of the year's very best movies so far."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes manages to do at least three things exceptionally well that are hard enough to pull off individually: Maintain a simmering level of tension without let-up for two hours, seriously improve on a very good first entry in a franchise and produce a powerful humanistic statement using a significantly simian cast of characters."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,100,"An altogether smashing sequel to 2011′s better-than-expected “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” this vivid, violent extension of humanoid ape Caesar’s troubled quest for independence bests its predecessor in nearly every technical and conceptual department."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,91,"Director Matt Reeves, working from a script by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback, elevates the apes to primary importance in this intelligent thriller."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,91,"In truth, the deeply absorbing and thematically rich ‘Apes’ sequel is more akin to a drama than an action film, but it's one that still satisfies the desires and demands of big, blockbuster filmmaking."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,90,"“Dawn” is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,90,Serkis’ Caesar gets more than his fair share of rip-snortin’ badass moments. He’s arguably the finest leader of men we’ve seen on screen since “Lincoln.”
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"Loud, smart and ferociously committed to its premise, and it leaves an intriguingly bitter aftertaste."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"This installment inches events closer to a merge point with 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" while maintaining its own unique identity. It is in every way superior to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."""
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"Good news – it’s incredible. It sets the standard for blockbuster action movies, and manages to be even better than its predecessor."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,This is an “Apes” for the ages.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"It's a provocative sci-fi action film with dynamite special effects, a powerful humanistic theme with echoes of real-life social conflicts, and a truly wondrous performance by Serkis."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,88,"For two hours of breathless drama, you forget you’re watching actors grunting like chimps and hope two rival civilizations can work together."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,83,What’s striking about this new film is that it lays out the message-mongering in such a way that you can enjoy the movie equally well on a purely action level.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,83,It speaks to the masses with some treats for the discerning types in the back.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,83,A sequel that easily tops its 2011 predecessor.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"A satisfying balance of family drama, political intrigue and all-out action (an ape cavalry charge has to be seen to be believed) do, in truth, only constitute half of the story, as Reeves' sci-fi sequel is as much a technical triumph as a narrative one."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"A superbly mounted, powerfully performed, if slightly underfed Apes sequel. That Reeves is set to direct Untitled Of The Planet Of The Apes next is cause for much celebration. This guy’s fur real. No pun intended."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Even given the spate of post-apocalyptic and dystopian films that rule the multiplexes, this is the bleakest “franchise” in human history, and I’m curious if there will be any balm whatsoever in the next close encounter of the furred kind."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,Makes for riveting viewing. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is among the more brisk 2 hours and 10 minutes I've spent in a theater in some time -- and it's easily the most rewarding of this year's summer tentpole films.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Yet for all the heady ideas at play, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes remains a visceral film, one of movement, action, unexpected developments, and disarming poignance."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Eschewing a tidy wrap-up, Reeves doesn't leave us feeling manipulated, as so often happens in films like this. Instead, we want to know where the story goes from here, and that's no small accomplishment."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a much better and far less silly movie than its predecessor.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Not quite the intimate parable of the first movie nor a balls-to-the-wall battlefield extravaganza, Dawn is pitched somewhere in the middle, with much of its two hour-plus running time powered by the simmering, expertly sustained tension both between and within the two species."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"Just as 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes surpassed expectations, so this sequel delivers on its promise and leaves us wanting more – which we'll almost certainly get."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"It may lack its predecessor’s lofty ambitions, but once the bullets, spears and hairy fists start flying you’ll be too wrapped up to care."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,80,"There's evident patience and intelligence to the filmmaking all over, as well as an engagement with genuine ideas about diplomacy, deterrence, law and leadership. However often it risks monkey-mad silliness, it's impressively un-stupid."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,78,"The narrative and its attendant lessons about how one rotten ape and/or human can spoil the bunch are engaging, although I found myself drifting during the battle sequences."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,The apes and the special effects team are the real stars of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"Visually, this movie is big, bold, often awe-inspiring."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"In one of the most wickedly funny scenes in sci-fi history, Koba uses monkeyshines to bamboozle some gun-toting yahoos and scuttle the peace treaty."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"Whatever audiences think of it, I'd say the latest ""Apes"" picture is just that: a solid success, sharing many of its predecessor's swift, exciting storytelling and motion-capture technology virtues."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes works both as allegory and action-adventure film. The internecine conflict between apes mirrors the troubled history of our own race.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"Dawn is dynamite entertainment, especially in the rousing first hour."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"An action-packed epic, a moving sci-fi allegory rendered in broad, lush strokes by the latest state of the computer animator’s art."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,75,"This is a summer blockbuster contingent on grand bargains, tactical retreats, and a ferocious, inevitable shock-and-awe campaign."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,70,What is missing from the film is wit—the deep wit that comes from playing off species and environments against each other.
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,70,"When it gets going, it’s a pretty fine movie."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,70,"""Dawn's"" vision of masses of intelligent apes swarming the screen as masters of all they survey is even more impressive than it was the last time around and reason enough to see the film all by itself."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,67,"Yet for all the heart and soul the actor pours into his role, watching Dawn still feels a bit like seeing massive, expensive wheels spin in place."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,63,"At a certain point in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, you expect Caesar to say, ""Et tu, Koba?"" Maybe a bit obvious, but it would have shown some wit."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,60,"For its few visual and many script flaws, however, director Matt Reeves (“Cloverfield,” “Let Me In”) balances the splashy set pieces with quieter moments (sullen teen Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a copy of Charles Burns’ “Black Hole” to a wise orangutan named after Maurice Evans!) in such a way that “Dawn” never feels dull or draggy."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,50,"If you see the movie, notice how the ending is no ending, and the fact that it even feels like one is entirely a function of Michael Giacchino's musical score."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,50,"Watching an army of apes riding horses heading into battle is undeniably cool, but that’s the only thing the movie gives you: Neat eye candy. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is written at a level so low, even 8- year-olds will find it lacking."
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.6,208545589,40,"Any film that begins with one of those fake-news montages, where snippets of genuine CNN footage are stitched together to concoct a feeling of semi-urgency around its hackneyed apocalypse, already sucks even before it gets started."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,90,"Bird layers on plenty of dazzle... But his heart is what keeps the story motoring and the ending is perfectly engineered, including a coda that encourages all of us to try harder."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,90,"All hands on both sides of the camera do outstanding work. Clooney seems to be enjoying himself thoroughly as the old grump whose creative flame hasn’t been entirely extinguished, but it falls more to Robertson to carry the film, which she does with great energy and appeal."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,83,Bird has crafted a gorgeous world rife with creativity and inventive images. A Spielbergian sense of candid awe and wonder permeates each scene with a nostalgic edge.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"An amalgamation of Disney's heritage, current status and future enterprises that starts in the evocatively rendered 1964 World's Fair, Tomorrowland is a refreshing and well-intentioned standalone piece that revels in a creatively manufactured appropriation of the conglomerate's existence."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"If you’re willing to let a few things slide, this is one of the best family blockbusters in years. Clooney and Robertson (literally) soar, the madcap action always feels grounded and Bird’s world is bursting with visual invention."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"Bird and Lindelof have thrown everything they have at this film and, aside from a pause for breath at the end, they’ve made something funny, surprising and packed full of wonder."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,80,"Director Brad Bird deserves praise for packing such big ideas into such an accessible, rip-roaring, retro-futurist adventure."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,The movie leaves a bunch of questions unanswered but rockets ahead in such entertaining style that I scarcely minded.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"A spectacular ride for most of it, and while you're a little let down at the end, you kind of want to jump back on and do it all over again."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"The movie is saying something worth hearing about the place the future holds, the concept and promise of it, in human existence. It’s an attempt to wrest that vision from the narrow fantasies of doom-peddling action filmmakers. That’s an attempt worth making."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"There's a surprising number of salient, even revolutionary notions about human nature and intelligence throughout, none fully explored but enough to make the running time at least 20 minutes too long."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"Tomorrowland is a crazy, disjointed mess. But it’s the good sort of crazy, and it’s the sort of mess you want to lose yourself in."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"At times Tomorrowland plays like such a throwback to those sweetly naive, low-rent, live-action Disney matinees of the '60s and '70s, George Clooney is like a Fred MacMurray with gravitas, gruff and grizzle, predictably warming up to a young dreamer (a terrific Britt Robertson) of cheer and vision."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,75,"If you treat Tomorrowland mainly as an immense cinematic theme park that unveils a new ""ride"" every few minutes—just as Bird's last feature, ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" was mainly a series of action scenes—its weaker aspects won't be deal-breakers."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"It’s so smart, so winsome, so utterly rejuvenating that you’ll have to wait until your eyes have dried and your buzz has worn off before you can begin to argue with it. And you should argue with it — even if you had a blast, as I did, and want to see it again with the kids, as I do — because it’s a major pop-culture statement with all sorts of implications, both vital and nutty."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"Tomorrowland may not fully reach the heights for which it strives, but it has a good time trying."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"The wonder of Tomorrowland – and with all its flaws and its hidebound Disney formula, it really is wonderful – is that Bird’s tale of nostalgia for the lost future manages to recapture some of that original, optimistic meaning without losing sight of the newer and darker one."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,70,"George Clooney and newcomer Britt Robertson are solidly compelling, but Tomorrowland remains only a moderate success, its ingenuity, wit and enormous heart too often at odds with a ho-hum story and tentpole conventionality that the film tries so hard to transcend."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,67,"Tomorrowland is a rather sweet excursion into speculative sci-fi, and, wonder of wonders, it doesn’t even seemed primed for a sequel. But this movie about the thrill of the visionary is, alas, mostly earthbound."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,67,"There’s much to applaud and much to knock in this Disney action adventure. Tomorrowland breaks the mold and becomes something quite original, while at the same time it ballyhoos its inspirational message to an extent that deadens the narrative."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,67,"Bird stages the PG mayhem with his usual grasp of dimension and space, his gift for action that’s timed like physical comedy. He keeps the whole thing moving, even when it begins to feel bogged down by preachiness and sci-fi exposition."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,65,"Tomorrowland is a globe-trotting, time-traveling caper whose giddy visual whimsies and exuberant cartoon violence are undermined by a coy mystery that stretches as long as the line for “Space Mountain” on a hot summer day."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"Unlikely to be remembered in decades to come - or even in months to come, once the next teenage dystopian fantasy inserts itself into movie houses."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"Brad Bird's Tomorrowland, a noble failure about trying to succeed, is written and directed with such open-hearted optimism that you cheer it on even as it stumbles."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"The thing barely makes a lick of sense. Rapturous on a scene-by-scene basis and nearly incoherent when taken as a whole, the movie is idealistic and deranged, inspirational and very, very conflicted."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,Tomorrowland is an interesting collage of moments and ideas in search of a strong narrative and a coherent ending.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"Bird cooks up lots of eye candy, but the dazzle wears off, and nobody really connects emotionally."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,63,"In Brad Bird's film, the way forward is backward, on a path that stumbles into misplaced nostalgia and dicey humanism."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"Tentpoles are rarely guilty of overreaching, but Tomorrowland has a tendency to feel out of control, a film that is finally more ambitious than accomplished."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"Tomorrowland is half a day having all the fun of the fair, and half a day paying for it back in the classroom."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"This fantasy adventure lacks focus when it should be laser-sharp, and stumbles when it could soar."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,60,"When it puts down its copy of ‘Political Philosophy for Dummies’ and focuses on character and action, Tomorrowland is a blast."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,58,"Tomorrowland may be well-made, but whether you're talking about it thematically or dramatically, this is a profoundly mixed bag."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,Tomorrowland is a bright and pliable sci-fi thriller that stiffens into a sermon. Can’t it just be fun?
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Tomorrowland is designed, just like its theme park namesake, to celebrate optimism."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Tomorrowland is a highly original, occasionally even visionary piece of sci-fi filmmaking, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"The whole film is an argument about nothing less than the future — can we fix our troubled world or not? But for all of its vaulting ambition, its sumptuous eye-feasts and its leapings back and forth in space and time, Tomorrowland never comes together as coherent drama in the here and now."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Maybe the ultimate goal of Tomorrowland remains obscure because once you know where the story is headed, you realize it’s a familiar tale. The movie can conjure up futuristic images, but the story is nothing we haven’t seen before."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"The film never adds up to the sum of its parts, effectively a two-hour trailer for a movie I’d still be interested in seeing."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Tomorrowland comes across as a grinning rictus of a movie, a desperate door-to-door evangelist trying to force its foot into the door and push its salvation by any means possible."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Steeped in a nostalgia that often feels borrowed and canned—the space-age era impulses of progress and possibility from the 1950s and ‘60s—Tomorrowland asks that you never give up or lose hope, literally and figuratively, over and over again, to the point that the movie has little else to say."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,"Brad Bird’s Tomorrowland is a great-looking, old-fashioned, at times soaring adventure ultimately brought down by a needlessly convoluted plot, some surprisingly casual violence and heavy-handed lectures about how we’re our own worst enemy and we’re going to destroy the planet if we don’t get it together."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,50,The glaring failure of Tomorrowland is that its central premise — children are the future — is almost completely negated by the preachiness of the execution and the clumsiness of the storytelling.
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,42,"Multiplex audiences can choose over the next few weeks between two starkly different views of the future. The remnants of humanity struggle for survival in the brutal world of ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" while Tomorrowland offers an optimistic retro-future paradise full of jetpacks and robots. Me, I'll take post-apocalyptic desert wasteland over soulless corporate utopia any day of the week."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,40,"Its idea of the future is abstract, theoretical and empty, and it can only fill in the blank space with exhortations to believe and to hope. But belief without content, without a critical picture of the world as it is, is really just propaganda. Tomorrowland, searching for incitements to dream, finds slogans and mistakes them for poetry."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,40,"The problem is, the closer our heroes come to their goal, the weaker the story becomes. What we're left with is a film that gets off to a ripping good start, but which -- given how little time is actually spent in the fanciful world after which the whose shebang is named -- ends up feeling like a cinematic bait-and-switch."
Tomorrowland,6.4,93436322,38,"Disney’s gimmick of naming movies for its theme-park attractions crashes and burns in Tomorrowland, a here-and-now caper that will confuse children, bore adults and offend anyone who’s ever taken a science class."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,88,"A splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,83,"Despite a few places where the air of déjà vu is a bit too thick, it's a class act, with a textured script, one of the series' more stunning title sequences."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,80,Whatever its flaws -- and it has some lulus -- it's a textbook model for how to structure action of this kind.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,80,Puts the Bond film series (this one makes number 19)-- back on track by stressing the fundamentals and applying a bit of authentic drama for a change.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"There's nothing special, shocking, or precedent-setting about the film, but it functions on a level that 007 fans will appreciate - as eye and ear candy for those who prefer action to exposition and character development."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,Fans will appreciate not only that the film is predictably solid and surprisingly sharp but that parts of it are just plain bad.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,There's the script -- and that's the problem.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,You can't beat a Bond film for adventure on a grand scale.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"A thoroughly satisfying, completely entertaining film that's also, rather surprisingly, an emotionally full experience."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,"That's what Bond is all about -- dazzle, some really bad puns and the kind of sexy fun that satisfies high-school urges while masquerading in tux and tails."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,75,Comes closer to what a Bond movie should be and once was.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,Isn't quite enough to save the Bond franchise -- but it does prove that 007 is Y2K-compliant.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,Not enough to add up to a fully satisfying movie.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,70,"The formula, with its comforting arrangement of familiar elements, is what we're after, and The World Is Not Enough certainly comes through on that front."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,67,"Apted (""Gorillas in the Mist,"" ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") keeps things low-key and low-tech, which makes some of the cliched Bondisms a bit easier to swallow."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"Fair, overlong James Bond from the second shelf."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"The movie's already peaked, even before the opening credits."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"Spoofing James Bond in the '90s may lack an original comic bite, but making James Bond in the '90s is positively toothless."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,63,"This 19th Bond installment is passable, but only just."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"Brosnan brings an intelligence and wit, together with a lightness, to the role - his softly Celtic vowels pleasingly reminiscent of Sean - along with a plausible virility Roger Moore never quite managed. And Pierce wears some beautifully tailored suits as to the manor born."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"The World Is Not Enough is, without a doubt, a solidly entertaining chapter in the Bond franchise's chequered history. But while Apted fiddles with the format, this is far from an overhaul of the blueprint, and so lacks the whiff of freshness long-time fans may have been sniffing for."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"The latest 007 extravaganza has enough plot developments, double-entendres, emotional underpinnings and, of course, Bond girls, action scenes and explosions to furnish at least a couple of Bondfests, with plenty left over for an episode of Nash Bridges."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"This keeps one reasonably amused, titillated, and brain-dead for a little over two hours."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,"In his third and most comfortable effort to model the Bond mantle, Pierce Brosnan bears noticeably more resemblance to a real human being."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,There still is enough tightly staged action and sly humor to earn this latest installment a memorable place in Bond canon.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,60,007 is undone by villainous scripting and misguided casting and acting in a couple of key secondary roles.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The hero himself has been denatured for a young, late 1990s audience with little appreciation for real suavity or sex play."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"If moviegoers really thought about the violence, sexism, and materialism at the core of the series, the whole shebang might vanish overnight."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The movie is better than you've heard, although that's not saying a lot."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"If Bond long ago became part of your fantasy life or your pop iconography, then the anticipation of a good Bond movie would probably survive even if The World Is Not Enough were worse than it is."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The World Is Not Enough, like a 19th version of anything, is inanely self-parodic. So much so that one wonders why Austin Powers need have bothered in the first place."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,Makes the strongest case for retirement since late-period Roger Moore.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,50,"The new Bond movie is pure nonsense art of the dadaist school; it follows the rules of the ridiculous as it turns narrative convention, thriller formula and special-effects set pieces into a manifesto of the purest gibberish."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,45,James Bond hasn't been this boring since Timothy Dalton carried the license to kill.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,40,Bond spends an awful lot of time being rescued from peril by supporting characters.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,40,Solid 007 entertainment -- not as bad as some of the recent Bonds but not as spunky as some of the series' originals.
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,20,"Most of all, though, I wondered how much longer people will pay to see a walking, running, driving, diving, punning, smirking, swimming, skiing, shooting, parachuting corpse."
The World Is Not Enough,6.4,126943684,19,"If you're desperate for a James Bond fix, skip the movie and blow your 007 bucks on a copy of the soundtrack."

Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Soaring and romantic, wild and serene, feminist and gutsy, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best movies of the year."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Transcends its origins and becomes one of a kind. It's glorious, unashamed escapism and surprisingly touching at the same time."

Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The picture is more fun than it has a right to be.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,My first viewing left me dazzled but slightly confused; a second deeply impressed; a third rhapsodic. I wish I hadn't needed to rediagram it in my head to turn it into the masterpiece it so obviously wants to be.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"Crouching Tiger's blend of the magical, the mythical and the romantic fills a need in us we might not even realize we had."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The first Ang Lee film I've seen that I've liked without qualification.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Magnificently nonchalant about its magic.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,Has the sprawling canvas of an epic and the emotional heat of classical melodrama.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,"A masterful synthesis of generic conventions and creative imagination, a sublime amalgam of some of the best tendencies and talent our times have to offer."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,100,The film satisfies on both visceral and emotional levels.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,Crouching Tiger's dramatic line is so blurry that the central character is only a bystander to the climactic fight between forces of good and evil.
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"There's so much dreamy beauty in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that it's almost like a narcotic."
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"What about Ronny Yu's 1992 masterpiece ""The Bride With White Hair,"" of which Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a decent facsimile?"
Wa ho jang ryong,7.9,128078872,90,"The film may be too talky for action-minded viewers and too fantastic for more serious spectators, but it brings appealing twists - including a feminist sensibility - to the venerable martial-arts genre."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,88,"A hugely enjoyable shambles. It’s a comic deconstruction of that most useless of Hollywood artifacts — the blockbuster sequel — that refuses to take itself seriously on any level, which, face it, is just what we need as the summer boom-boom season shifts into high gear."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,83,"“22” merits a B grade. The long final credits, in which Dickson imagines dozens of future scenarios for the undercover boys, kicks it up one notch."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,83,"Just think back to everything that was funny in ""21 Jump Street."" It's exactly the same."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,83,"Suffice it to say that it is a cannily-constructed film, and it does have a bigger ""movie"" feel than the first film. There are places where they swing for some big jokes that don't quite work, but the ambition is dizzying all the way through."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,83,"22 Jump Street might not be quite as good as ""21 Jump Street,"" but it's remarkably close, to the point where subsequent viewings could see it elevated above its predecessor."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"A great deal of insanity ensues, none of which would work if Tatum and Hill weren't so disarming in their roles. Their level of comfort with the characters and each other helps 22 click."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"More is more and is, at times, just right in 22 Jump Street, an exploding piñata of gags, pratfalls, winking asides, throwaway one-liners and self-reflexive waggery."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street is, ultimately, a celebration of the silly and the sweet, a combination that's welcome again and again."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street is a success, as there is a little good ol’ fashioned “heart” beneath its post-modern veneer."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,Bigger and better – 22 Jump Street joins the exclusive list of sequels that out-gun their originals. We’re already knocking at the door of no.23.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,Rare is the film that understands the pleasures of letting an enraged Ice Cube take out his wrath on an all-you-can-eat buffet. And which other blockbuster in 2014 would interrupt its climactic car chase to lob in a gag about Benny Hill?
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"It certainly provides that rarest of things: relaxing enjoyment. In all its uncompromising goofiness, 22 Jump Street brings onstream a sugar-rush of entertainment."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"This excellent film is a sequel and knows it, and wants us to know that it knows it."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street is hugely successful in retaining - and in many instances, improving upon - the qualities of it predecessor and pitching some jokes that will still have people chuckling for days afterwards."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"A few of the self-referential gags get recycled one too many times, but an exuberant buoyancy — and the belly-laugh-a-minute pacing of the jokes — makes 22 Jump Street a hilarious highpoint of an already quite funny summer season."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"It's laugh-packed, self-aware in a manner that lets everyone in on the joke, and goofily satisfying in the action department."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,80,"22 Jump Street hits far more often than it misses, and even when it misses by a mile, the effort is so delightfully zany that it’s hard not to give Lord and Miller an “A” for effort."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who are themselves impressive partners at this point) know enough not to mess with a successful formula.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,It's a self-aware movie that makes fun of the macho clichés it indulges.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"This is a sequel that wears its well-worn formula, mocking inside jokes and gleeful taste for overkill proudly, flying the high-lowbrow flag for audiences that like their comedy just smart enough to be not-too-dumb."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"The car chases are unremarkable, but the stunts — which comically juxtapose Tatum's athletic grace and Hill's stocky clumsiness — are a hoot."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"Thanks to this team of merry pranksters, 22 Jump Street hurts so good."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"22 Jump Street is exactly what comedy is today. It's coarse, free-flowing and playful."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,The sharp writing and tag-team antics lift 22 Jump Street to a high level.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"The movie wouldn’t work, of course, without the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, an unlikely duo who share a tremendous charisma."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"Be sure to hang around for the closing credits, which imagine all sorts of ""Jump Street"" sequels to come."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,22 Jump Street is a mixed bag of clever spoofery and miscalculated outrageousness. The unveiled homoeroticism of practically all interaction between Jenko and Schmidt is amusing to the point when it isn't.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"A comedy about sequels. Like its predecessor, the movie continually teeters on the edge of breaking through the fourth wall."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"There are certainly a lot of actors who can match Hill and Tatum as comic actors, but it’s the oddball connection between these two that makes for a very entertaining couple of hours at the movies."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,75,"This comedy produces the biggest, loudest laughs of any movie this summer."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,70,"22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,70,"The best comic turns are by the Afro-Asian twins Keith and Kenny Lucas, whose timing is eerie and superb."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,70,"The repetitions are meant as a sort of metajoke, and it works well enough, more often than not, though heightened levels of raunch and chaos seem not so much meta as frantic."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,70,"22 Jump Street squeezes every last drop of comic inspiration it can get from Tatum and Hill, as well as the very notion of a sequel to such a superfluous enterprise."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,70,"22 Jump Street isn't uncharitable or mean-spirited; at worst, it's just confused. Tatum is, predictably, adorable. His Jenko is a pumped-up naïf bumbling through life with a crooked smile, and Hill again makes a great sparring partner."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,67,"To cover up the script's lack of originality, screenwriters Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman pummel us with a string of self-aware meta-commentary jokes that poke fun at bloated sequels."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,63,"There are times when 22 Jump Street is borderline brilliant. Unfortunately, those instances are outnumbered by segments that don't work for one reason or another."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,63,"22 Jump Street's scattershot approach to comedy is rooted in the belief that for every anatomical, scatalogical, sexual, or pop-cultural reference and pun gone awry, another will stick to the wall like, um, bodily fluid."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,60,"Here's the crazy thing, though. Against all odds, it works."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,60,"At its best, 22 Jump Street is less an action comedy than a loosely plotted revue, and though it’s not as witty as either Joe Dante’s ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"" or Edgar Wright’s ""Hot Fuzz"" (in which the directors evinced genuine love for their chosen genres), it’s sure as hell better than a straight buddy-cop sequel."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,60,"22 Jump Street is the good-natured, sloppily rendered pile of balderdash for that moment, a movie that’s immune to all criticism and not worth bothering to dislike."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,60,"The laughs are what keep the film together, even when the conceit feels been-there-done-that."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,60,"22 Jump Street knows how to play to its strengths: Tatum’s performance here is even more puppy-dog lovable than last time, and his scenes with Hill possess a goofy, low-key warmth too often lacking in big-budget comedy."
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,50,An unusually fun and funny film.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,50,What’s the difference between “21 Jump Street” and 22 Jump Street? Same as the difference between getting a 21 and a 22 at blackjack.
22 Jump Street,7.0,191719337,50,"As funny and batshit insane as the movie often is, the fact that 22 Jump Street knows it's a tiresome sequel doesn't save it from being a tiresome sequel, even as Lord and Miller struggle to conceal the bitter pill of convention in the sweet tapioca pudding of wall-to-wall jokes."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,88,"Body of Lies neither panders nor condescends. It involves current events and has a political viewpoint, but it overplays neither."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,88,"The crisply photographed and edited Body of Lies reveals some ambition, for while it certainly works as pure entertainment, this tale of a good man trying to extract himself from an impossible situation offers some commentary on America's feelings about being in Iraq."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,80,"Its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding, Scott's film may be the sharpest of all the post-9/11 thrillers--and also the most purely entertaining--in the way it maps the vectors and currents of the modern intelligence-gathering game without losing us in its dense narrative thicket."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"Body of Lies is a James Bond plot inserted into today's headlines. The film wants to be persuasive in its expertise about modern spycraft, terrorism, the CIA and Middle East politics. But its hero is a lone ranger who operates in three countries, single-handedly creates a fictitious terrorist organization, and survives explosions, gunfights, and brutal torture."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"The result is commendably non-West-centric, but no less sentimentally conceived."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,Fascinating and flawed spy thriller.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"It's not like the screens are so flooded with decent movies that we couldn't use another, particularly a timely, clear-eyed thriller about the Middle East and the role of the U.S. therein."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,"As good as it is in pieces, its protagonists are distancing, its story is tangled, its film-noir cynicism is oppressive and unglamorous, and it just doesn't leave us with the satisfying unity of the kind of great movie it wants to be."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,Leonardo DiCaprio brings straight-razor reflexes and rooted emotion to the role of a deceptively rugged CIA man.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,75,It's a genre film - the action is fierce and nonstop - with a brooding undercurrent of unease that aims for the complexities of John le Carre.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"It may not be as much fun as old spy movies starring Cary Grant or more recent entertainments such as ""Spy Game,"" directed by Ridley's brother Tony, but it feels all too accurate."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"The movie is smart and tightly drawn; it has a throat-gripping urgency and some serious insights, and Scott has a greater command of space and a more explicit way with violence than most thriller directors."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"With its urgent post-9/11 context and often brutal violence, it seems off-key to describe Body of Lies as a nifty political thriller, but that's what it is."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,70,"Always crisp and watchable. But as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,67,"Ftrangely emotionless. There's little offered in the form of rooting interests or compassionate characterizations, making the film ultimately as ephemeral as its title."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,67,"Doesn't have much new to offer in either style or substance. It's got the same glossy-gritty urban warfare sheen as ""Black Hawk Down"" and every other Third-World geopolitical action thriller of the last few years."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,The most interesting thing about this slick but frustrating picture is the way it puts Crowe’s  Hoffman  at the center of our mixed feelings.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"A tautly paced, well-acted espionage thriller with the requisite explosions and action sequences. Still, it ends up leaving the viewer rather cold."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"The romance seems tacked on as a way to humanize this character; there's no reason the nurse would take up with a brash, secretive American."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"It's a generic, clunky title. The movie isn't quite as disposable, but it's not exactly memorable, either."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,63,"Scott doesn't bring much to the table as an action director, and his keen storytelling abilities go invisible here."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,60,"The film has one indelible asset: Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian spymaster Hani. He's sleek and lounge-lizard sharp like a young Andy Garcia, and he could be bigger than Garcia. The Jordanian holds all the cards, and opposite two superstars, Strong is the only actor who holds the camera."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,A mostly formulaic approach that becomes more disappointing as the yarn unwinds.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"As it is, the movie is a hodgepodge of borrowings and half-cooked ideas, flung together into a feverishly edited jet-setting exercise in purposeless intensity."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"For all of Ferris's desperate struggles, and for all the director's efforts to emulate the remarkable verisimilitude he achieved in ""Black Hawk Down,"" his new film remains abstract and unaffecting. It's a study in semisimilitude, more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"Lacks, a story that makes it feel personal."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"Like Scott's last picture, ""American Gangster,"" this is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"Aside from a nifty new way to avoid surveillance in the middle of the desert, there's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies - including ""Spy Game,"" directed by Scott's brother Tony before 9/11."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,The sickly feeling that Body of Lies leaves at its conclusion isn't just about the brutality of its subject; it's the realization that real-life barbarism translates so easily into adrenaline kicks for the multiplex.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"DiCaprio and Crowe, two supposedly high-wattage movie stars, are remarkably dull to watch together--perhaps because so many of their scenes together take place over the phone."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,50,"In all, Body of Lies is a mixed bag of treats and trials, but it should be seen by audiences, and emulated and improved upon by other top directors."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,42,"It's a lot easier to follow than ""Syriana."" But intelligibility is about the only thing this international thriller has going for it."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,"Excessively intricate and extremely dull, the latest example of a filmmaker giving us a disjointed, overlong movie that’s unnecessarily confusing to follow."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,"It's like torture, though Body of Lies has nothing to spill."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,Depressingly inert.
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,40,"For all the enthralling visuals and action, the film feels garbled."
Body of Lies,7.1,39394666,33,"Most of this just seems, you know, so three years ago, so ""Bourne"" again."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,90,The Industrial Light & Magic special visual effects unit does yeoman work in staging the action with cliffhanger intensity.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,89,This Tom Clancy thriller gets the proper screen treatment here with this first-rate cast and direction by one of the genres best: Die Hard director John McTiernan.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,88,"A skillful, efficient film that involves us in the clever and deceptive game being played by Ramius and in the best efforts of those on both sides to figure out what he plans to do with his submarine - and how he plans to do it."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,88,This is a Reagan youth's wet dream of underwater ballistics and East-West conflict.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,80,"Colorful and exciting, yet unless you're a young moviegoer, nothing in it takes you by complete surprise. (It's less a nail-biter than a chin-stroker.)"
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,80,"A heavy-duty mediocrity, sluggish, unwieldy, and instantly forgettable."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,80,"The film mechanically uses the crosscutting technique made famous by Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" without any of its wit or focused energy."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,75,Director John McTiernan rigorously avoids anything that might conceivably be exciting.
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,75,"The movie finally is never very convincing. Even the special effects aren't great. Mr. Connery, however, wears the movie as if it were a favorite old hat. He makes it look good."
The Hunt for Red October,7.6,122012643,50,"A leviathan bore, big, clunky and ponderously overplotted."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,70,"Johnson is genuinely talented. He's often the best thing in bad movies, and Ratner's Hercules is, at the very least, pretty good."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,70,"The mythically powerful demigod is back on the big screen in the simply titled Hercules and the results are canny, fast-paced, and, for what the film attempts to accomplish, enjoyable."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,70,"It may sound like a backhanded compliment to praise this sometimes cheesy movie for never taking itself too seriously, but in a summer of bloated spectacles, this modesty should not be underestimated."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,70,"It’s a grandly staged, solidly entertaining, old-fashioned adventure movie that does something no other Hercules movie has quite done before: it cuts the mythical son of Zeus down to human size (or as human as you can get while still being played by Dwayne Johnson)."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,67,"If anything gets lost in the mayhem, it’s Johnson’s reliably charming personality."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,67,"Unsurprisingly, Johnson makes for a perfect movie-star Hercules, and the film gets a lot of mileage by playing his charismatic-but-modest take on the character off of the strong, predominantly British cast."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,There's a welcome lack of pretension to the proceedings. Stalwarts like Hurt and Ian McShane are on hand to class up the joint — everyone's got a British accent except for Johnson — while the predictable story bludgeons its way towards an inevitable conclusion.
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,"Brett Ratner remains a director of no great distinction, but here, he proves himself an adept orchestrator of battle scenes, clearly presenting the forces on both sides, and using clear, coherent editing and dynamic compositions."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,Hercules has no right to be as entertaining as it is.
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,"Fast-paced, funny, and packed with – to indulge in a bit of ad-speak — eye-popping action."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,"Sure, the film is crude, calorific and full of groanworthy half-jokes, but it holds together. It stacks up as an oafish pleasure for an undemanding summer – a rewriting of myths in scrawled crayon, with a nonchalant quality that makes its judiciously brief running time fly by."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,"With Hercules, Brett Ratner and Dwayne Johnson are out to entertain you — no more, no less. And that is just what they do."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,"There are some rousing battle scenes, preceded by stirring addresses on the subject of going to Elysium – all cheekily borrowed from Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator."""
Hercules,6.0,72688614,60,"By the beard of Zeus! Brett Ratner delivers fast, fun thrills to score a sound victory over Renny Harlin’s laborious The Legend Of Hercules."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,50,"Director Brett Ratner has always been associated with spectacle but, even for him, this represents a misstep because the ""wow!"" factor is muted."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,50,"As the plot clogs up with foreseeable reversals, wisecrack duties go to Mr. McShane, whose oracular character keeps wrongly predicting his own death. Like Hercules, the movie is plagued by a split identity: It’s half-slog, half-Mel Brooks."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,42,"When Johnson is wearing the head of the slayed Nemean lion in battle, walloping enemies with his tree-trunk sized club, and heaving charging horses to the ground with remarkable ease, he's in his Rock comfort zone. But as a tortured hero hampered by self-doubt, Johnson labors."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,40,"Strap on your swordbelt, buckle your sandals and oil up your rippling six-pack, because here comes yet another interminable, CGI-drenched mythic mish-mash with far more money than brain cells."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,38,"Director Brett Ratner could boast solid source material in the five-issue Radical Comics series Hercules: The Thracian Wars by the late Steve Moore. They had a shot at something here, and they blew it."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,38,"For all the fun these folks could have had with Hercules maintaining the supernatural assistance facade, or denying it as his handlers gild his lily testifying that it’s true, the movie is content to just go through the motions."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,37,"This outing does not suffer the epic badness one associates with films that aren’t screened early for critics, and in fact it offers moments of actual entertainment. It simply fails to exploit its assets: an amusing, revisionist take on the mythological strongman, and the charisma of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,33,"It's mythmaking for dummies, a Hercules with no poetry, only incompetent brute strength."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,25,"Watching Hercules, you can feel your intelligence being insulted in almost every frame."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,20,"It's a supernatural epic that never feels quite colossal or consequential enough, as well as an utter waste of Dwayne Johnson‘s unique dopey-flirty charm."
Hercules,6.0,72688614,12,"The film fluctuates haphazardly between semi-serious reverence and tongue-in-cheek camp, with no shortage of opportunities for the inevitable Rifftrax accompaniment."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,80,"Dodgy history and dodgier accents, but Kevin Costner's medieval romp still has some magic – and shouldn't be judged on the weakness of its imitators."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,80,"Except for the political implications of the addition of Freeman's character (which he brings off gracefully) and some revisionism about the nobility of the crusades (which, in my opinion, is long overdue), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is just an adventure movie - which is basically what I like about it. The second half is stronger than the first because it's swifter and more action-packed. Robin's feats of derring-do are always (as Costner might put it) neat - the more improbable, the better."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves looks like big money. It has the stars, it's based on a classic (and foolproof) story and it's an exhilarating couple of hours. It fills the entertainment megabill utterly."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"Despite the miscasting of the central role and quite a lot of lackluster dialogue, the story proves again to be almost foolproof. The fight sequences are explosive, the physical production is impressive, and the supporting performances are full of juice."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"As a piece of escapism, this deluxe, action-heavy, 2-hour-and-21-minute Robin Hood gets the job done. You’re carried along by plot, production values, and some choice supporting actors. Yet it’s a rouser without a rousing hero. Costner doesn’t disgrace himself — he has the star presence the role demands. What he’s not is an impassioned Robin Hood. And without the sense that Robin is on a humanistic mission (one that’s a pleasure to fulfill), the story has no charge."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,75,"With so much money and talent at work here, though, this latest incarnation of the legend is considerably smaller than the sum of its parts."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,70,"The mix of comedy, '90s sensibility, and swashbuckling action is more hit than miss, even if the overall effect is rather slapdash. Spirited, irreverent stuff, but not for those who like their myths kept sacred."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,67,"Not exactly Errol Flynn, but not the embarrassment that was Disney's Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves is a fun popcorn flick take on the centuries-old legend. And hey, it does have a great cameo by a former Robin Hood as the best King Richard ever."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,63,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a murky, unfocused, violent and depressing version of the classic story, with little of the lightheartedness and romance we expect from Robin Hood."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,63,"Director Kevin Reynolds has no flair for action: the climactic battle is so ineptly shot and edited that it is difficult to tell who is smiting whom. While Costner is lifeless and speaks strangely (he was said to have attempted a British accent, then abandoned it during shooting), Mastrantonio is an acceptably vivacious Marian."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,60,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has pomp and scale; what it lacks is something essential -- a sense of Once Upon a Time wonder, the exultant, heady thrill of legend."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,60,"Drawing purely on his technical skills, Reynolds is finally able to get some momentum going in the picture's final half-hour, when a defeated Robin musters the remains of his band and makes a last-ditch attempt on the Sheriff of Nottingham's castle. It seems to be enough to erase memories of the movie's painfully slow start and send the audience out reasonably happy and stimulated. But Robin Hood does not seem to be the defining blockbuster this summer still needs."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,60,"Though the new Robin Hood observes all of the classic confrontations that keep the tale alive, the film winds up as a mixture of listless adventure, wispy comedy and what is meant to pass for social realism."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Kevin Costner very definitely isn't Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and his noticeable awkwardness in that rebel's role underlines the problems this muddled, fitfully effective version of a most durable English legend has in deciding which face it wants to present to the world at large. While the makers of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves may have set out to bury the poor old duffer of Sherwood Forest in a welter of trendy banter, they have ended up burying themselves as well."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Not till the very end of the film, when King Richard pops up, portrayed, in a surprise appearance, by an actor who has launched many a grand movie adventure, will audiences get a glimpse of epic star quality. Then, like the Merry Men, they will unleash a hearty ho-ho. The rest of this Robin Hood merits only a ho-hum."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"The picture only comes alive at the end with Robin and his Moorish helper (Morgan Freeman in a typically strong performance) turning into a medieval Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in hand-to-hand combat with the sheriff. Otherwise, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an entertainment without a particular point of view."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Black powder and Christian Slater are cool and all, but real dramatic successes come when a film has both heart and a slate of talented actors who aren’t just leaning on their oversized patchwork capes to tell the story."
Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,6.9,165500000,50,"Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood is a Robin of wood. Murky and uninspired, this $50 million rendition bears evidence of the rushed and unpleasant production circumstances that were much reported upon."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,100,"Mythic, thrilling and brilliantly made motion picture."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,100,"The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser, dashboard shots that face inward instead of out, catching Gyllenhaal and Peña in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,100,"One of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,91,"Nerve-rattling in the best way, the sharp, visceral urban police procedural End of Watch is one of the best American cop movies I've seen in a long time."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,88,"David Ayer, the writer of ""Training Day,"" director of ""Street Kings,"" writer/director of ""Harsh Times,"" does not make movies about princesses with witchy curses, about yuppie commitment-phobes, about talking plush toys. His territory is narrow, but he owns it: cops, in Los Angeles."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,88,"The problem with End of Watch, a gripping police drama, is director David Ayer's stylistic decision to shoot nearly the entire movie tripod-less. Or, to put it another way, there's a whole lotta shakin' going on."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,83,"I wish that the Mexican drug cartel subplot was not so overwrought and Oliver Stone-ish, and the decision to shoot much of the film ""Cops""-style is also problematic. But the film puts you right inside an everyday inferno and, to its credit, doesn't turn down the heat."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"It's a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if it's on rails."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"There's nothing in David Ayer's cop drama End of Watch that you haven't already seen, but the film has moments so riveting that you might not care too much."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"End of Watch is one thriller where the adrenaline rush, considerable as it is, is almost always put in the service of character. Happily, the character on display turns out to be considerable, too."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"A visceral story of beat cops that is rare in its sensitivity, rash in its violence and raw in its humor."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"If Ayer had taken as much care with his bad guys as he does with his leads (and their deftly sketched wives and colleagues, played by Anna Kendrick, America Ferrera and Frank Grillo, among others), he might have crafted a seamless picture."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"As social insight, End of Watch is useless, but as engrossing entertainment, it's irresistible, thanks to Ayer's gift for dialogue, the relentless pacing set by film editor Dody Dorn, and gorgeous performances by Gyllenhaal and Peña."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"The action and the chemistry is stronger than the story, because Gyllenhaal and Peña are good. In that respect End of Watch works better as a series of vignettes held together somewhat loosely by a larger story."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,Easily one of the year's best films and one of the best ever in the well-worn cop genre.
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"Ultimately, the mock-doc device works because Gyllenhaal and Pena so completely reinvent themselves in-character. Instead of wearing the roles like costumes or uniforms, they let the job seep into their skin, a feat without which ""End of Watch's"" pseudo-reality never would have worked."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,80,"America Ferrara (""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'') turns in an image-changing role as a tough lesbian officer who develops a grudging admiration for our heroes."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,75,"The two cops are cocky and funny and young, and it still takes a good half hour to accept that they may be as forthright and dedicated to their jobs as they appear to be."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,75,"Unlike many action thrillers where the viewer is fairly certain that no real harm can come to the protagonists, such is never the case here. In this gritty ride-along, we sense that anything can happen, which adds to the propulsive momentum of a riveting story."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,75,"A muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,70,"In the last 15 minutes of the film, he burns up some of the credibility he established by not pushing extreme situations too far earlier on."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,70,"End of Watch is more than the sum of its parts, though; it ends on a downbeat note, but that's something I've come to expect from Ayer."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,67,"It's powerful stuff, but I almost felt like I needed an intermission."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,End of Watch gives you the savage whoosh of being on a job that can get you killed. Sins of cop clichés can be forgiven when a movie pays honest tribute to police on the line.
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"The camera is just everywhere, from the point of view of everything. When I left the movie the other night, people complained of seasickness."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"No doubt, these twin saviours are a likeable tandem, and they bear their cross lightly. Still, End of Watch suffers from no end of sanctimony. Sainthood is all well and fine but it ain't drama and, on screen at least, the question cries out: Where's a corrupt cop when you need him?"
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"The drawback of the film's visual approach, however, is a considerable one. The relentless first-person shooting in End of Watch - figurative and literal - is less about YouTube factuality than it is about Xbox gaming reconfigured for the movies."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,63,"Forceful and arresting, Ayer's follow-up to ""Harsh Times"" and ""Street Kings"" sees him confidently playing to his strengths."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,60,"Gyllenhaal and Peña's relationship, a sort of heterosexual love affair, is depicted with a sense of tenderness and care that does not extend to the cartoonish villains that dominate the film's lackluster final act."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,58,"By virtue of its style and high stakes scenario, End of Watch is impressively tense, but then so are most episodes of ""COPS,"" which don't suffer from the forced melodrama found here."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,58,The performances here are so sharp that viewers may wish End of Watch has been shot by someone who knew how to find the right point of view for a scene and leave it there.
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,50,"Shallow down inside, End of Watch is a music-video Frappuccino of quick cuts, sparkling banter, serial crises, grisly violence and tongue-jerk profanity. But the film is exciting, in its manipulative way, and exhausting."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,50,"It almost becomes comical to count the number of ""who's holding the camera now?"" reverse shots that the filmmaker haphazardly inserts to propel the story forward. Such visual ineptitude, like much else in this tediously cocky enterprise, is downright criminal."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,40,"Despite the violence and procedural detail, this is about as gritty as Dixon of Dock Green."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,40,"End of Watch is pure frat-boy fantasy, the video game to Southland's great American novel."
End of Watch,7.6,41003371,38,"End of Watch is a repellent movie, first for its shaky-cam conceit rendering much of the action incomprehensible, and finally for seeking to entertain viewers through the thuggish execution of a police officer."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,100,The Longest Day is visually stunning--its extraordinary camera movement and Cinemascope photography brilliantly augmenting the meticulously reenacted battle scenes. The only thing bigger than the film's scope are its stars.
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,90,"It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war than this one does."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,80,A solid and stunning war epic.
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,78,Just look at the cast and try to resist the testosterone pull of this movie.
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,60,"High on noise, spectacle and heroism as the Allies invade Normandy, generally strong on performances and humour, but still over-long and laden with the usual national stereotypes."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,60,"At three hours it does seem bloody long at times, but is still a suitably epic tribute."
The Longest Day,7.8,39100000,60,"Seen now, the picture is ludicrous, pointless, and stirring all at once."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,88,"A blast, the best action movie of the summer."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,83,"When Bekmambetov is in full stride and the gore, oaths and silver bullets are flying, it's a kick.  The title may sound like a joke, but Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is serious fun."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,78,"Benjamin Walker, as Lincoln, may not have the gangly gravitas of Raymond Massey's ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" – he looks like a young Liam Neeson doing a younger Bruce Campbell, frankly – but he does have a sly, self-effacing sense of humor that feels ever so Lincoln-esque"
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,75,"Instead of getting smirky and campy and blowing out the joke in the first few scenes, Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov straight-face it. They ask themselves, well, what would it be like if the main struggle of Lincoln's life were with vampires intent on taking over the new world? And they answer the question as realistically and soberly as they can within this loony framework."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,75,"Without a doubt the best film we are ever likely to see on the subject - unless there is a sequel, which is unlikely, because at the end, the Lincolns are on their way to the theater."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,"There's definitely some empty-calories, summer-movie fun to be found in this ludicrous genre mashup, most of it courtesy of maniacal Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, who stages hilarious, imaginative, almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,"Genre enthusiasts will lap up the mixture of action and fantasy, while history buffs who don't mind a bit of rewriting will dig into an alternative spin on the Civil War period."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,70,A Civil War-era actioner of questionable taste and historical accuracy but surprisingly consistent entertainment value.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,"A stylish slasher of a movie, a monster flick that does its vampires right, if not their real-life counterparts."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,Both terribly silly and a lot of fun.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,"One expects a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter to be rich in wit and black humor, but writer Seth Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov opt to play things reasonably straight."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,63,The script leaps forward with an absurdity almost as great as Lincoln's own strength.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,60,"Bekmambetov directs with gusto, and the forthright absurdity of the story, combined with its weirdly heartfelt self-belief is winning."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,58,"With so much flesh crunching and bloodletting, it could have been scary as all Walking Dead get-out. Instead, the movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle - a swing that's effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls, but dull when applied to filmmaking."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,50,It's not nearly as snappy or campy as it should be-though its self-seriousness is its own kind of entertainment.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,50,"It sounds fun. It's a little fun. For a while. But Bekmanbetov shoots every killing spree like an addled gamer, working that slow-down-speed-up kill-shot cliche like a maniac."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,42,"The training montage where Lincoln learns to twirl his axe around his body like a baton for no apparent purpose is neither the movie's first laughable sequence nor its last, but it sums up the movie's aesthetic: The filmmakers mistakenly think nothing is silly if it's done with a grim enough facial expression."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"It doesn't take long for Bekmambetov to wear out his welcome with a laundry list of generic-looking action sequences: When you've seen one vampire get stabbed in the eyeball, you've seen 'em all."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Unfortunately, there's also a certain artificiality to the whole film, both visually and narratively."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is such a smashing title it's too bad someone had to spoil things by making a movie to go with it.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Given the subject matter, an exercise in delicacy and restraint was unlikely, but it's too bad that the film's concept is way more entertaining than what has ended up on-screen."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"The grave tone makes it stiff and leaden, the digi-saturated look is a turn-off. Damnable and disordered."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"The problem with movies based on a single joke is that a single joke is rarely funny enough to sustain the running time of a feature-length film. And with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the whole joke is in the title."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Watching this is like flipping channels randomly between a Masterpiece Theatre drama and a splatter film on Cinemax. If you're like me, you'll stick with the splatter."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"Possible resulting ""fun"" is only slightly mitigated by contemplation of the wearisome decadence of American popular culture."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,40,"What [Bekmambetov] doesn't do is offer us any respite from his 3D CGI barrage, an assault on the senses that makes the bullet John Wilkes Booth fired into the real Abe's noggin seem calming by comparison."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,38,"The biggest high comes from the images evoked by the title alone, or the title in tandem with the movie poster, doesn't it?"
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,38,The movie deserves a stake through the heart.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,"A pox upon history and an insult to the 16th president of the United States. It's that, of course - actually, that's the point - but this joyless, deafening cinematic headache commits a different crime. It's a sin against entertainment."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,"Other than its campy title, not much about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is fun."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,25,Enormous in its scope and colossal in its stupidity.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"What I don't understand is why this extended piece of idiocy chose to sink its stinky teeth into our 16th president. If an axe-wielding hero was required, George Washington would have been the better choice, with the Redcoats as bloodsuckers."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"This ludicrous CGI extravaganza, based on the comic horror novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, can stand proudly beside the best-worst of Ed Wood and Uwe Boll."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,20,"This insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously, which is truly deadly."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,5.9,37519139,0,"I didn't know whether to be more offended as a moviegoer or as an American, but I do know I'd rather gargle nitroglycerine than watch this again, though given that the film looks like it were buried under a log cabin for a century, I barely saw it the first time."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"Bay's movie couldn't be more timely; whatever you think about this subject, you might admire his attempt to come to grips with it in a summer blockbuster."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"It's got a hot premise, some cool sets, attractive stars and action that lets up only when it thinks you're about to surrender."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"The Island runs 136 minutes, but that's not long for a double feature. The first half of Michael Bay's new film is a spare, creepy science fiction parable, and then it shifts into a high-tech action picture. Both halves work."
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"Bay's best film since ""The Rock."""
The Island,6.9,35818913,75,"The movie is more about how many things Michael Bay can smash up -- lots. That might not be a talent most people respect, but it gets through to people anyway, and here Bay does it exceptionally well."
The Island,6.9,35818913,70,"Starts off an aggressively derivative sci-fi thriller, then morphs into an above-average chase melodrama."
The Island,6.9,35818913,70,"Glossy, witty eye candy with some moderately chewy stuff in the middle. This lavish, exhaustingly kinetic film is smarter than you might expect, and at the same time dumber than it could be. It's an impressive product: a triumph of cloning that almost convinces you that it possesses a soul."
The Island,6.9,35818913,67,Make no mistake: This not high art. But it does its job without insulting our intelligence or unpleasantly jangling our nerves.
The Island,6.9,35818913,67,The final third...is so overblown and anticlimactic that it finally gets you thinking about empty profundity and loose ends.
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,There's enough fun to be had that it's almost possible to ignore the stupidity of the story and the cavity that replaces character development.
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"Bay's strength as a filmmaker, the reason his superficial yet entertaining productions can never be completely ignored, is that he appears to lack shame. He'll blow anything up and run anybody over. The moral complexities don't matter to him. He just wants to stage spectacles, appreciate very good-looking people, and assert his cowboy aesthetic."
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"As the careening cars go splat, splat, splat, the director's vision of the future looks like a cheerfully mindless combination of two extremes of carnival entertainment: demolition derby and whack-a-mole."
The Island,6.9,35818913,63,"Scarlett Johansson looks lovely and hasn't much to do besides that, McGregor only starts having fun when he's playing the ""original"" of his clone."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"Frenetic actioner about refugees from a genetic cloning plant starts off intriguingly, burns up its ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest with joltingly repetitive action sequences."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"This is pure essence of Bay--it's big, it's loud, it has no context, and if you show up tanked, I'm sure it's really quite poetic."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"There is nothing wrong with the action sequences beyond their sheer length and number. They're in the ""Road Warrior"" mode: hyper-fast and vicious."
The Island,6.9,35818913,60,"Like its slack-jawed clones, The Island is full of energy and incredibly pretty but burdened with only the minimum of smarts."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"For all the menace of its techno-prattle, its implicit boosts for humanism and its swell production design, the picture is finally a bore. Sci-fi was more powerful when its special effects were cheap and crude, its ideas simple but potently stated."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island begins with a whimper of interest as a cool-hued, cautionary exploration of the ethics of cloning, and ends, in a hail of product placement, with a dumb bang."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"As usual, Hollywood hitmeister Bay is more interested in blowing stuff up than in addressing deep questions like the morality of science and the false myths of civilization, and these explosions go on for over two hours."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,Nary an original idea abounds in The Island.
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Classic Bay, except it's missing the crass director's fine-tuned rhythm, his feel for adrenaline, his breakneck edits and sense of humor."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The best thing about The Island is this: Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, buffed and dressed in sparkling white, wondering how and when to kiss each other."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The first half is high-quality science fiction, the rest is a high-tech chase adventure with a gleeful yen for destructive thrills."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island could be read as a metaphor for societal ills (commercialization, conformity, pharmaceutical overkill) if it weren't so shamelessly dumb. And dumb it is."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Chases, crashes and explosions are thick on the land in the second half of this movie, but though they are expertly done, their size, frequency and increasing disconnection from what was once a coherent story leave you feeling pummeled rather than exhilarated."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"This frenzied fiesta of firepower is about cloning people for spare parts, but the movie is a clone itself. Possessing no new ideas, it reworks and borrows from such films as ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix"" and ""Logan's Run."""
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"For a slick pop entertainment, more than the usual quotient of timely ideas rattle around between the relentless product placements and futuristic geegaws."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Steve Buscemi supplies the only spark of intelligent life in this numbingly flat universe, despite the fancy gadgets, the high-speed chases, and a skyscraper collision reminiscent of the World Trade Center attacks."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" The Island is the kind of suicidal high-concept movie increasingly prevalent these days: a film so thoroughly pre-conceived and pre-sold that most audiences know more about what's going on than the characters do for half the movie."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"Unfortunately, The Island grows dumber as it goes along, gradually disintegrating into a generic good-versus-evil spectacular that not only defies all known laws of gravity and physics, but also suffers from the lack of morality that plagues Bay's films."
The Island,6.9,35818913,50,"The Island walks a weird, wobbly line between being stupid, falsely fattened-up entertainment and a picture that just might have possibly been made by a person with a brain -- a scrambled one, but a brain nonetheless."
The Island,6.9,35818913,40,What makes this movie so inadequate is that there are some moments in it that could have been really worth watching.
The Island,6.9,35818913,40,"An overblown science-fiction epic in which ostensibly unthinking, unfeeling stem-cell-like entities not only think and feel, but look and act like glamorous movie stars."
The Island,6.9,35818913,38,"A borrowed idea -- hello, ""Blade Runner,"" hi there, ""Matrix"" -- but an idea nonetheless."
The Island,6.9,35818913,30,"If you like ""Maxim,"" you will love The Island. It is glossy. It is expensive. It has lots of slick ads for Aquafina and Cadillac."
The Island,6.9,35818913,30,"If you find yourself at ""The Island"" I have only three words of advice: Vote yourself off."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,75,For Friday night this will do just fine. It's definitely a good matchup -- Stone's cynical bravado versus Berry's resilient spunkiness in a world-class cat fight.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,70,"Not everybody will be able to swallow its heady romanticism, yet its French director, Pitof, has brought sophistication to a comic book sensibility, which helps some purple patches of dialogue along with other absurdities."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,67,"I wouldn't call Catwoman incompetent, yet it has no visual grandeur, and very little surprise; you can tick off the story beats as if they'd been graphed."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,50,"Much like a cat, the movie is a superfluous gob of fluff with an attitude ranging from idiotic to nasty."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,50,"The result is not the train wreck one might anticipate from surfing the Net. The catfights, overacting and Berry's swagger in a skimpy, tight, leather outfit that would be right at home at a Hookers Ball make for campy fun."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,42,"Berry has no character to play, but Sharon Stone's an over-the-top hoot."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,The lure of Halle Berry as the leather-clad feline should help this mangy misfire claw out a decent opening before a quick slink to DVD.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,"Overall, though, the film drags at 91 minutes, filled with dead air that should be crackling with pulp energy."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,The frustrating thing about Catwoman is that Berry does her damnedest to make the character work. Some of her physical moves are astonishing: Her offhanded grace is exceedingly catlike.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,"If ""Spider-Man 2"" is this summer's main comic-book-movie course, Catwoman is clearly the leftovers."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,40,"Catwoman, which talks about the ""duality"" inside all women (wild vs. docile, rapacious vs. cuddly), does have its guilty pleasures. Most of these come courtesy of ice queen Stone."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Hisses for Catwoman. Unfortunately for Oscar winner Halle Berry, this movie belongs in the litter box."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,A movie needs more than a few sexual innuendos and throaty purrs to keep us from taking a catnap. How about a strong story and credible characters?
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Catwoman is a mess, there's really no other way to describe it... It doesn't work as high art, and it's too ponderous to be truly high camp. As a fashion shoot for the pin-up crowd, however, it's the cat's meow."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Watching [Berry] run around in that getup I felt embarrassed, the way I do for people who put on makeup before climbing a StairMaster -- it's too much."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,38,"Like the action movies of yore (you know, the 1980s), Catwoman is simultaneously overstuffed and undernourished."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"A howlingly silly, moderately diverting exercise in high, pointless style."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"What the movie needs is a director, and what it gets instead is Pitof, a French visual-effects maestro so much fonder of technological wizardry than of human flesh that he manages to turn even his slinky, sinuous star attraction into a digitized synthespian frolicking about endless CGI cityscapes."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,It goes down (and comes back up) like a hairball.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"Dragged down by a paper-thin story, the predictable number of fight scenes executed at equally predictable intervals and stock, unmemorable characters."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast is the real superhero; his homage to noir thrillers compensates for the spotty CGI and rescues the movie from sex-kitten kitsch.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,30,"The ""Showgirls"" of superhero movies. This is not a compliment. A vacuous lingerie show posing as feminism, it's the biggest movie hairball this side of ""Garfield."""
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,A catastrophe.  This motion picture is an embarrassment to all involved.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Pitof can be blamed for the 89-cent digitized sets, the jerky or rubbery special effects, some clunky performances and more continuity errors than I could count."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,Cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Silly, tedious, inept disaster."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Berry is giving a performance much too earnest to have been intentionally campy, setting herself up as a veritable shoo-in for this year's ""Worst Actress"" Razzie. Me-ouch!"
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,Catwoman is pretty well summed up by Hedare: This is a disaster. Its a total bloody disaster.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"The director, whose name is Pitof, was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"Not to be catty about it, but the stench of the litter pan is all over this big-screen $90 million disaster-in-waiting."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,25,"The film could have turned out worse, but only via the addition of a Tom Green cameo, or an accident in which the actors caught on fire."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,20,A cinematic cat-astrophe.
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,16,"[Pitof's] managed to create an entire digitalized city that has all the allure of an underground parking garage. And his action, it's cluttered; his editing, it's confused. The result: blandness butchered, hamburger chopped, kitty littered."
Catwoman,3.3,40202379,12,"Utterly devoid of merit, fantastic or otherwise, a more exasperating descent into the feline world is difficult to imagine."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,75,I guess you have to be in the mood for a goofball picture like this. I guess I was.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,75,I'm pleased to report the new Land of the Lost movie keenly understands that what was once scary is now ridiculous.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,70,"Land of the Lost is an enjoyable regression to Saturday mornings gone by, as junky and sweet as a strawberry Pop-Tart."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,63,Scrambled space-time comedy that's as light and silly as it is erratic.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"Land of the Lost has stray amusing tidbits, but overall it leaves you feeling splattered."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"It ends up sagging into a pleasantly undistinguished pudding. The big news is that Matt Lauer, playing himself, can act. A little. Hardly at all, really. But he’s a jolly good sport, and quite handy with a fire extinguisher."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,It's hard to know just who the intended audience is: The movie is too surreal and bawdy for young kids and too silly for anyone older than 25.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,Not exactly a hundred million dollars' worth of classic comedy.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"It's cheap-looking (dinosaurs and other beasts here look like CGI loaners from Spielberg), deeply mediocre and predictable."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,The result is eight times as strange and exponentially more potty-mouthed than the original series.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,50,"If director Brad Silberling had taken this cast to their natural extremes, he might have delivered a raucously funny sci-fi comedy -- think ""Anchorman"" meets ""Jurassic Park."" Instead, Land of the Lost is an utter misfire -- not bad enough to hate, not good enough to remember."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"Ferrell's latest excursion into delusions of manhood is director Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost, an action comedy with the sloppy construction and saving grace notes of the star's other movies."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"The only marginally interesting, if unsurprising, thing about the pricey movie spinoff of the junky children's television show Land of the Lost is that a lot of money has been spent on yet another cultural throwaway."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,Land of the Lost isn't a terrible movie. It's merely a perplexing one: Who is this thing for?
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"Like its characters, the film keeps getting lost too, stumbling as it struggles to keep kids and adults from squirming in their seats."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,40,"Humdrum adaptation that should, given the ripe nature of its source material, have been much better."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,"A turd of T-Rex proportions, Land of the Lost makes one remember last summer's ""Speed Racer"" fondly."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,The whole thing feels at least three summers too stale.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,"Genially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,"Ferrell may well shoulder the blame for Land of the Lost, even if he doesn't deserve it. He did, however, willingly participate in this coarse, sloppy big-screen version of the old Saturday-morning time-warp adventure."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,38,Will Ferrell and Danny McBride can find the dumb fun in anything. Too bad that Land of the Lost is so much less than anything.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,33,"It doesn't help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material, with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck, and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,33,It's all so resolutely uninspired that even the kids in the audience may want to duck out.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,30,The result is a movie with an exceedingly narrow target audience that should test Will Ferrell's appeal among boys maybe ages 12-14 -- about the only demo likely able to endure this laborious mess.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,30,"Lame sketch comedy, an uninspired performance from Will Ferrell and an overall failure of the imagination turn Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost into a lethargic meander through a wilderness of misfiring gags."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,30,Summertime junk food.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,25,"There is also a sense that the filmmakers weren't quite certain if they wanted to make a fun, kid-friendly adventure or a bawdy adult-skewed comedy. Walking the tightrope doesn't work."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,25,Land of the Lost is one of those films so caught up in its concept it has forgotten its audience.
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,20,"It's all noise and flash and chaos, but it lacks virtually everything that made the original television series so memorable."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,20,"This lumbering, ha-ha-look-what-we-remade action-comedy is a high-concept disaster."
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,12,"Will Ferrell's terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy -- and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny -- experiment in ""family entertainment."""
Land of the Lost,5.4,49438370,0,"This dramatically, thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of $100 million to make and isn't worth the celluloid it's printed on."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,75,"Conan the Destroyer is more cheerful than the first Conan movie, and it probably has more sustained action, including a good sequence in the glass palace."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,70,"A predictable quest plot is unwound with tremendous verve, and the only real disappointments are some ropey special effects. But Fleischer's zest for action carries it all along splendidly."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,70,"Conan the Destroyer is the ideal sword and sorcery picture. As Conan, Arnold Schwarzenegger seems more animated and much funnier under Fleischer’s direction than he did under John Milius’ in the original – he even has an amusing drunk scene. Jones just about runs off with the picture."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,63,"Conan the Destroyer is not an awful follow-up, just a mostly unnecessary one."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,60,"Under the direction of veteran Fleischer, this superior sequel to the plodding Conan The Barbarian boasts much more speed, skill, and ingenuity than its predecessor."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,60,"Destroyer makes all the mistakes Barbarian avoided. Dropping the first movie’s grim approach to achieve an audience-friendly rating, the sequel goes for a lighter, more overtly humorous tone, with multiple characters serving as increasingly unnecessary comic relief."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,58,"The special effects aren't bad, and there are fewer decapitations than in Conan the Barbarian. Mr. Fleischer seems to want this film to be funnier than was the first one, directed by John Milius, but Mr. Schwarzenegger, a body builder who can lift freight trains, can't easily get his tongue into his cheek."
Conan the Destroyer,5.9,31042035,50,"Arnie still swings that sword with aplomb, but with a story this ludicrous, he's on slippery ground."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,75,"The script by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling gets relaxed, throwaway laughs, even if it doesn’t always hold together."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,63,Pixels is a blast of energetic fun.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,60,"Pixels is a slice of pure, frivolous entertainment that doesn't try to overreach."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"it’s not as original as it wants to be, despite having the able Chris Columbus in the director’s chair."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"The visual effects are impressive, and there is a certain kick to seeing the human characters dodging barrels in a life-size Donkey Kong. But we don’t really care about the humans; here, at least, Q*bert is more endearing than Adam Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"With a novel idea at its center and some good jokes scattered throughout, Pixels is a relief from the self-serious action films that invade movie theaters at this time of year. For most of the way, it’s good enough to enjoy, and for the rest of the way, it’s good enough to root for. But ultimately, it’s not quite good enough ... to be good enough."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"Pixels has a few inspired action sequences and a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, but overall the special effects are surprisingly average — and the lazy acting by Adam Sandler, the shameless mugging by Kevin James and the hammy performance by Brian Cox don’t help. Not even Peter Dinklage in a mullet can save the day."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,50,"Sporting a flowing mullet and aviator shades, Dinklage perks things up considerably as the story’s comically arrogant bad-boy-turned-good-guy."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,42,"Even on its own silly terms, Pixels is not a very good movie; it’s painted up like a Ghostbusters-style fantasy-comedy but plays like so many slapdash Happy Madison productions before it."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"Pixels is a casually sexist, awkwardly structured, bro-centric comedy, starring some of Sandler’s buddies. The only difference this time is that state-of-the-art CGI has been added to the mix."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"If Sandler can’t find it in himself to be verbally or physically entertaining on set, you start to wonder why he’s there in the first place, although his hollow stare in a number of scenes suggests he may be pondering the same thing."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"On this evidence, maybe the eighties weren't so great after all."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,The truly mystifying thing about the movie is how desperately it caters to Gen-X junk nostalgia without bothering to think that maybe those Reagan-era kids have grown up a bit.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,40,"At isolated moments a tolerably amusing send-up of alien invasion disaster movies in which the attackers are video arcade-era renegades arrived to gobble up as many famous landmarks as possible, this one-note comedy runs out of gas within an hour (it is based on a short film) and should have been trimmed to a neat 90 minutes."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,"When one considers how good this material might have been if placed in the right hands, to see it squandered this way makes it almost more painful to view than the typical Sandler stinker."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,Pixels may feel flatter to kids of the ’80s than it does to moviegoers too young to have known Pac-Man from Ant-Man.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,"Long before you’ve gotten a nickel’s worth of entertainment out of this dumb, unfunny flick, you’ll be wishing for the flashing sign that says “Game over.”"
Pixels,5.6,78747585,38,"The 3D adds little, and the hallmarks of the Chris Columbus directing style are unevenness and luck. With a little of the latter, this could be a huge hit. But with a better star, sharper script and more Dinklage, it could have been a champ."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,37,"Lazy humor and familiar plotting aside, Pixels at least gets a little mileage out of its affection for the 1980s."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,33,"Neither Sandler nor his listless writers (too many punchlines just sit there and collect flies) seem invested. Whether he’s saving the planet or putting the moves on Michelle Monaghan, Sandler can’t be bothered to raise his pulse above comatose. If he doesn’t care, why should anyone else?"
Pixels,5.6,78747585,33,"Basically it's Ghostbusters meets Wreck-It Ralph, without the sustained charm or wit of either."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,30,"Some movies are so interminable that it seems they might never end, while others are assembled with such indifference that you are essentially left waiting for them to start. Pixels somehow manages both."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,30,"For a movie that’s supposedly about delivering weightless, uncomplicated fun, Pixels is an overwhelmingly sad experience."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,30,"Even though it’s fair to say that Pixels is on steadier ground than most of Sandler’s recent comedies, the film is nevertheless flat-footed and grows tedious after the first hour."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,"The ""characters"" vary from slightly annoying to unbearable - this is a film in which a viewer can be forgiven for rooting for the old video game icons to annihilate humanity. God help us if the best savior we can muster is Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,Yikes! I saw Pixels as a 3D metaphor for Hollywood's digital assault on our eyes and brains. Not funny. Just relentless and exhausting.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,"I think Sandler's miscasting leads to a real deficit of energy at the center of the film, and then the conceptual misfire is so dire that I just don't know what to say beyond that."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,25,"This is a Happy Madison production, and as such it's exhaustively lazy, outside of its righteous dedication to the valorization of the man-child."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"A movie like Pixels should be stupid and energetic, not stupid and lifeless."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"Here's a shocker: In Pixels, his latest, Adam Sandler plays a stunted man-child who turns out to be very, very special."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"Pixels is ultimately a thoroughly numbing experience, not least because all the characters are doomed by a psychological flatness more two-dimensional than any arcade-game screen."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,20,"Where Sandler once exulted in our outrage (and frequently, our laughter), he now seems barely capable of mustering enough effort to carry a scene, let alone advance to level 255 of “Galaga.” There’s no joy left in his shtick."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,12,"Pixels is a movie without wit, without jokes, with nothing to say but plenty to regurgitate."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,12,It stumbled onto an accomplishment truly awe-inspiring: It makes “Battleship” and “The Watch” look good.
Pixels,5.6,78747585,8,"There are legitimate excuses for going to see Pixels. Losing a bet, perhaps. Having a loved one held for ransom. Maybe a serious blow to the head. But none of those (except maybe the last) would allow you watch and actually enjoy the latest cinematic leavings of Adam Sandler."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,0,"As a bad movie, Pixels is extremely dismissible. The ways in which it is bad are hardly fun to pick apart, a la ""The Room;"" instead, they're just banal — the deeply predictable plot, the unfunny jokes, the constant low-level sexism and occasional spikes of racism that permeate the story."
Pixels,5.6,78747585,0,"Every joke is lame, every special effect unspecial."

The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,80,"This spirited rerun, neatly mixing parody and panache, squeezes a surprising amount of fun out of the old war horse."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"The film is a display of traditional movie craftsmanship, especially at the level of the screenplay, which respects the characters and story and doesn't simply use them for dialogue breaks between action sequences."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,Proudly old-fashioned in every way except the often excessive violence that director Martin Campbell splashes across the screen.
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"A great deal of excitement and adventure, all brought to the screen by using a somewhat irreverent tone that keeps the mood light without trivializing the characters."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"This pleasant movie anachronism, an assemblage of traditional Robin Hooded scenarios (and superior swordplay) that, in the right light, is a nostalgic treat, and in shadow evokes Monty Python."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,75,"The return to an Errol Flynn-style hero, who can swing from chandeliers, fight with two swords at once and ride a horse backward, recalls a movie era both sexier and more innocent."
The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,70,Old-fashioned fun that goes down as smoothly as a vintage cocktail.

The Mask of Zorro,6.7,94095523,40,A romantic adventure-movie slapstick that's too screwy for the action crowd and too old-fashioned for the Home Alone contingent.
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,63,"By-the-numbers, generic plots no longer work and that, unfortunately, is what Seventh Son delivers. Impressive set design and visuals, excessive CGI, and a loud score from Marco Beltrami can't fully compensate for bland character development and a predictable narrative that rushes along on a linear trajectory."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,63,"Surprise! One doesn’t want to damn the movie with faint praise by saying “it’s not that bad,” but that’s kind of the most objectively accurate description of it, in all honesty."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"To its credit, despite a rough start (witch burning and all that), Seventh Son does not succumb to misogyny."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"Seventh Son is brisk and unpretentious, though the fact that these two qualities can be considered remarkable probably says more about the state of modern genre filmmaking than it does about the movie itself."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,The result is a movie that serves as little more than an excuse for Moore and Bridges to camp it up.
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"It’s a thoroughly incoherent, generally inane and surprisingly entertaining tale of witches and monsters and what legendary film critic Joe Bob Briggs calls “beast fu,” all set in a sub-Tolkien, sub-“Game of Thrones” pseudo-medieval universe."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"Seventh Son is not a good movie, but it’s also not a pretentious one, and I call that a fair trade."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,50,"The film is overstuffed, but it’s swift and unpretentious, barreling through a non-stop series of action setpieces without pausing too long to take a breath. The busyness doesn’t eradicate the clichés, much less enrich the film emotionally or thematically, but there’s no time to think about them when Bodrov and his screenwriters, Charles Leavitt and Steven Knight, are moving along to the next sensation. It’s transporting in that sense, and that sense alone."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,42,"Though the film sat in drydock for a year, partly so technicians could convert it to 3-D, it looks as dull as it sounds."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,42,"(Bridges) has a tendency to make mistakes, especially when it comes to science fiction and fantasy titles. He has followed up the minor disasters that were ""R.I.P.D."" and ""The Giver"" with Seventh Son."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"A swollen budget, a mini-Big Lewbowski reunion, and top-notch digital effects fail to enliven proceedings in yet another ho-hum dragon chaser based on a YA novel."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"This swords-and-sorcery throwback has little imagination on display, instead doubling down on computer-generated flair to pass the time."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Seventh Son is indescribably disappointing because it could have been a refreshing treat for genre fans. After spending years in development, the final product is laughably abysmal, and perhaps worst of all, utterly forgettable upon viewing."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"This rambunctious swords ’n’ sorcerers fantasy flick has grubby, pseudo-medieval CGI style to burn, but precious little in the way of anything new to add to this sort of genre storytelling."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Seventh Son tells a story of dragons, witches, ghosts and ogres, but the most fantastic thing about it is the idea that someone thought this lumpy, bumpy and swollen sack of tired tropes and cluttered CGI would attract audiences."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Seventh Son is recommended only for the most far-gone of fantasy addicts, for whom it will serve as a sort of methadone. It won't exactly satisfy, but it will tide you over until the next season of ""Game of Thrones."""
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"Director Sergei Bodrov’s movie is based on a kids’ book in which Tom was a 12-year-old, and the actors wisely pitch their performances to a young crowd."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,40,"If anything, the movie offers up the guilty pleasure of seeing Bridges and Moore duel it out in front of countless green screens and a few stunning Canadian backdrops – two great actors clawing at each other with magic staffs and fake fire, trying to survive in the netherworld of heroic kitsch."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,38,"If the Brothers Grimm had devoted themselves to farce rather than scary fairy tales, they might have produced something like Seventh Son, a whacko sword-and-sorcery exercise."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,38,"Moore goes into operatic mode as Mother Malkin, a nasty witch who morphs into a menacing winged dragon. The worst performance, however, belongs to Jeff Bridges as a marble-mouthed, curmudgeonly knight named Master Gregory."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,38,"The only question that’s worth considering in Seventh Son is whether this all-star B-movie is bad enough to cost Julianne Moore her “Still Alice” Oscar. And the answer to that is, “Not really.”"
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,30,"Seventh Son not only offers no new spin on its bland, by-the-numbers story, it also fails to deliver any generic pleasures; I’m not sure this movie could even keep a young child engaged."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,30,"If nothing else, it’s amusing to imagine what [Mr. Bridges] and Ms. Moore chatted about between takes and how each managed to keep from cracking up, more or less."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,30,"Given the fine past work of its many parents, there was clearly potential here, but as delivered, Seventh Son amounts to nothing short of a creative miscarriage."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,25,"Torching “witches” is the one part of the story that has some historical basis, and adds an uncomfortable edge of misogyny to this otherwise empty fantasy."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,25,"Seventh Son moves at a fairly quick pace and has a sense of humor about itself. That doesn’t mean it’s thrilling, or funny. Just that it’s a quickly forgotten pile of junk."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,25,"As is often the case in films like this, Seventh Son is at its weakest when it tries to leaven its brink-of-disaster gravity with a little nerdy humor."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,20,"Seventh Son would hardly be the first film to use ""strong female characters"" as a means of waving its misogyny under the radar, but it’s seldom carried off as depressingly as this."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,20,"Jeff Bridges's abysmally campy performance may be the worst thing about disposable sword-and-sorcery fantasy Seventh Son, but it's also the only memorable thing."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,10,"I know it's early, but Seventh Son may actually be the worst movie of the year. It will most certainly be a contender. The medieval/fantasy/action/drama/romance hits pretty close to a perfect 10 on the egregious scale."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,0,"It is a staggeringly bad film, made up of lots of faulty pieces."
Seventh Son,5.5,17223265,0,"Nothing in Seventh Son is compelling, interesting or noteworthy, though you can feel the strain of the filmmakers attempting to set up a potential franchise."

Anaconda,4.7,65885767,75,"Coil up with a tub of popcorn, get a stranglehold on your soda - this is a creepy, action-packed boat ride down a jungle river with lots of huge snakes dropping by for man-sized snacks."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,75,A trashily entertaining reptilian version of ''Jaws'' set in the steaming heart of the Amazon rain forest.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,70,"Voight's performance -- one of the film's pure, trashy delights -- is all leer, sneer and macho swagger, while the rest of the actors feel like the disposable snake-fodder they are."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,67,"A silly and plodding ""Jaws"" rip-off about a 40-foot man-eating snake on the prowl in the Brazilian rain forest."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"The biggest flaw can be summed up in a short phrase: lack of excitement. Thrillers are supposed to be crammed with thrills (hence the name), but Anaconda is relatively barren of them."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"Feels like ""Alien"" as directed by Jim Henson. And the suspense is restricted to mundane slasher-movie tactics, including the frequent use of a mobile camera (call it the condacam) thats supposed to represent the snakes point of view."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,50,"Jon Voight, the all-purpose villain, does a pretty good job of imitating Marlon Brando imitating a Paraguayan snake expert, but the rest of the players--including Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Vincent Castellanos, Jonathan Hyde, and Kari Wuhrer--seem to be in a hurry to pick up their checks."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,"The movie provides a fair number of laughs, even if you can't help wondering how many of them were actually intentional."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,"In what is surely a tribute to the dazzling mediocrity of director Luis Llosa, the real jungle looks as bland as the fake jungle."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,40,Mr. Whipple squeezing his Charmin is scarier than this phony baloney computer effects-driven anaconda.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,38,"Quite unintentionally, director Luis Llosa and screenwriters Hans Bauer, Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. have crafted a howler; Anaconda, meant to be a nail-biting thriller, is a laugh-out-loud comedy."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,Such a classic combination of feckless dramaturgy and rampant excess that giving way to giggles is the only sane response.
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"Although it's refreshing to see an action movie that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't, this frankness has a downside, because what the picture so unapologetically is isn't, in fact, much."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"So desperate and silly that here and there, it's a lot of fun."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,30,"Charmless, unfrightening, and even devoid of the requisite gratuitous nudity, Anaconda just plain bites."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,25,"This film marks for Jon Voigt a concerted effort to unseat Christopher Walken in the competition for the Czarship of sneering, wheezing, Machiavellian, all-around weird guys. He spends much of his time standing around making a face like Beavis does when he's really freaked out."
Anaconda,4.7,65885767,20,"If only director Luis Llosa and his cast could see the joke and seize upon it; instead, like its computer-morphed snake, the film doesn't have a clever bone in its body."

Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,100,"Either Live Free or Die Hard will go down as the summer's best action blockbuster, or it's going to be one exceptional summer."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,91,Easily the best in the series since the first one.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,90,It's simply old-school stunts and movie magic.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,90,"Though the movie's at least 20 minutes too long, it's deeply satisfying, full of old-school buddy banter and the kind of action sequences that make you burst out laughing at their sheer audacity."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,The sheer quantity of often outrageous stunts should help overcome franchise mustiness to entertain.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"A slick and efficient piece of action entertainment, fast moving with energetic stunt work and nice thriller moves."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"Does it herald a renaissance in the action genre? Not really, but it's a welcome throwback to good old-fashioned, '80s-style lunkhead violence, and no one takes a punch, kick, elbow, or bullet quite like John McClane."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"Provided you don't think too long or hard about it (and why ever would you?), Live Free or Die Hard is infectious good fun, and a tremendous encouragement to the middle aged."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,80,"This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Early in LFODH, a villain taunts our hero, calling him ""a Timex in a digital world""; McClane, characteristically, takes the dig as a compliment. Two hours, countless butt-kickings and hairbreadth escapes later, we know why."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"The film's action doesn't disappoint; if anything, it ups the adrenaline ante considerably."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Willis, who at 52 looks great in an intensely physical role and can still spit out wisecracks and insults with the best of them."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Director Len Wiseman, confidently stepping up from the smallish budget ""Underworld"" films to mega-budget Hollywood mainstream."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"The action in this fast-paced, hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining film is as realistic as a Road Runner cartoon."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,"Surprisingly effective, rousing entertainment, which boasts plenty of old-school, at times jaw-dropping stunt work done the manly way."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,75,An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"At a time when the action genre has come to be dominated by sleek, matte surfaces and set-'em-and-forget-'em computerized effects, Live Free or Die Hard seeks to remind viewers of the simple, nostalgic pleasures of watching stuff get blown up and bad guys get smoked."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"Bruce Willis is ready to earn our love again by performing the same lovably violent, meathead tricks as before."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,70,"Willis' John McClane, with that sly, sideways smile, is like an old acquaintance you don't mind running into. He may be older and balder, but he's none the worse for the wear. And he can still take a punch."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,67,"Superior in every way to 1995's ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" Live Free or Die Hard's goofy generation-gap gambit pays off decently and proves, again, that nattily dressed terrorists are no match for Willis, the once and future Patron Saint of Bang."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,Gets the action job done and you better believe that Bruce is still the man.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"The key to enjoying the fourth installment in this testosterone-fueled franchise is accepting that it's a live-action cartoon that makes no effort to conform to the laws of gravity, plausibility or common sense."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"In the moments at his disposal, Smith almost steals the flick. He's so wittily government-phobic that I found myself hoping for a climax that would blow Bruce Willis away and promote Kevin Smith to saviour-of-the-free-world. Now that might be a sequel worth rooting for."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"Sorry, boys. After two decades, the first film still does more with one skyscraper than Live Free or Die Hard does with an entire country."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"Directed in workmanlike style by Underworld: Evolution's Len Wiseman, has its share of wild stunts and spectacular carnage, but it feels pokey and predictable, too."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,"An unexpectedly retro throwback to '80s actioners and '90s hacker movies, totally preposterous in both its heroic near-death escapes and abstract tech-jargon explanations for how anyone with geeky inclinations can remotely override any computer system with a few easy keystrokes."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,I can safely say I've never seen anything as ridiculous as Live Free or Die Hard. I'm not saying my 10-year-old self didn't enjoy a lot of it.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,63,Take away Bruce Willis and this is straight-to-video material.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,60,Yippee-ki-yay! Willis still has the goods.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,58,A middling contender in this summer of gigantoid sequels.
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,58,"Willis does everything short of donning a cape and reversing time by orbiting the Earth at light speed, and the air of cheerful ridiculousness recalls Luc Besson-produced action films like ""Transporter 2"" or ""District B13."""
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"Diverting enough if you want to see plenty of fast-paced action sequences, some heart-stopping chase scenes and plenty of things blow up."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"Maybe McClane, in '80s action parlance, is too old for this s---."
Live Free or Die Hard,7.1,134529403,50,"The physical stunts by Maggie Q as a lethal martial arts expert and Cyril Raffaelli as a Eurotrash sniper who rappels buildings are more thrilling than the over-the-top chase sequences, so contrived as to verge on self-parody."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,75,"Gangster Squad is a gang war drama built on Western conventions, a rootin' tootin', Camel-smokin', whiskey swillin' shoot'em up."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,75,The best thing about Gangster Squad is how they got the 1940s accoutrements right.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,70,"The cops play things as dirty as the crooks in Gangster Squad, an impressively pulpy underworld-plunger that embellishes on a 1949 showdown between a dedicated team of LAPD officers and Mob-connected Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) for control of the city."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,63,Penn's over-the-top tirades and bullying threats are still there - it's a wild and woolly performance that isn't always as menacing as perhaps the actor intended it to be.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,63,"Gangster Squad provides a welcome burst of heat and color, even if those qualities are more illusory than real and subject to a fast fade."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"For all the guns and gore, it's as breezy and uncritical as a tale from the True Detective magazine that the cops can't help reading."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Instead of expanding their sights, Fleischer and Beall narrow them, into a repetitive and increasingly exhausting series of shootouts. By the end, those guns might as well be held by extras, rather than some of the most talented actors of our time."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Made up of synthetics rather than whole cloth, this lurid concoction superficially gets by thanks to a strong cast and jazzy period detail, but its cartoonish contrivances fail to convince and lack any of the depth, feeling or atmosphere of genre stand-bearers like ""L.A. Confidential."""
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Typified by Penn's blustery performance, Gangster Squad is sleek, stylish but superficial. Easy on the eye, even easier on the brain, it doesn't last long in the memory."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,60,"Sean Penn's not been this fun since Jeff Spicoli and there's plenty of rip-roaring action, but Gangster Squad proves a minor entry in the annals of LA noir."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,Penn is always entertaining when he's playing characters drunk with depravity. Gangster Squad could use more of him.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"The irony is worth noting: Back when it was really 1949, Hollywood made noir with teeth; this is nougat with pretensions."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"It's the cinematic equivalent of Bon Jovi's You Give Love a Bad Name: You know in your heart it's a crappy song, and every wince-inducing line is an affront to your intelligence, but hey, it's on the radio, so you turn up the volume and sing along anyway."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,A cartoonish 1940s shoot-'em-up that's impossible to take seriously.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Josh Brolin plays the leader of the gangster squad as a kind of dedicated dunce, which is appropriate considering their clumsy antics. Ryan Gosling has more nuance as his right-hand man, but Emma Stone is completely out of her element as a slinky film noir heroine, a walking anachronism."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,In the last five minutes the film shifts gears and offers a tribute to law enforcement. But this tacked-on resolution is as sticky and fake as Sean Penn's make-up job.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"As a capable imitation of better movies by Martin Scorsese, Brian DePalma and Roman Polanski – it's reasonably successful entertainment."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Gangster Squad is an almost movie. It's almost terrible. It's almost entertaining. But it's missing the shameless insanity of a wonderfully bad movie, and the particular vision, point of view, and coherence of some very good ones. So it sits there in between - loud, flashy, and unnecessary."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,A triumph of production design but a pretty dull kill-'em-up otherwise.
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Despite the unrelenting action and the terrific cast, Gangster Squad comes up more scattered than successful."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"It never really comes together in a satisfying way, and given the talent involved, that adds up to a big disappointment."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"To be fair, this tawdry dose of pulp fiction (""inspired by real events"") is not a complete waste of time. It offers the marginal pleasure of an all-star cast slumming their way through a thicket of routine plotting, almost laughable dialogue and the constant blaze of tommy guns."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,50,"Brolin and Gosling are both supposed to be playing World War II veterans who bring their knowledge of battle into the tough turf of the streets, but that's just a concept that the sketchy, half-baked script tosses out there."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,42,"The violence is so indifferently presented that it has no kick; it’s not grim or graphic enough to shock, but it doesn’t rev us up, either. The picture’s various shoot-’em-up sequences are so generically conceived and shot that each one is indistinguishable from the next – by the movie’s end, they may as well all collapse into an exhausted heap."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,42,"Very few will remember it in a few months, which is probably just fine with the folks who made it."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,40,"The period thriller Gangster Squad plays like an untalented 12-year-old's imitation of Brian DePalma's ""The Untouchables."""
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,40,"The soul of the era is missing, and with it any reason to care. In Fleischer's hands, the high-stakes shootouts are as stylish as a GQ spread, but it's nearly impossible to figure out who's zoomin' who."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,40,"Though based partly on actual events, Ruben Fleischer's ludicrous shoot-'em-up plays fast and loose with the facts, and plenty else besides."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,38,"Slick, sick, self-consciously stylish and defiantly shallow, Gangster Squad is one of those movies you can't talk about without invoking other (often better) movies. A lot of movies."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,38,"It begins as energetic, clichéd nonsense and ends as irritating, clichéd nonsense."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,33,"Gangster Squad aims for the pop-operatic intensity of ""The Untouchables,"" but ends up feeling like a savage, simple-minded comic strip."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,30,"Mr. Beall, a former LAPD cop, has written a script so devoid of feeling that the cartoons blur into thin line drawings, while what's been done with the marvelous Ms. Stone - i.e. next to nothing - is downright criminal."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,30,"The proximity of horrible headlines scarcely matters - released on any day of any calendar year, Gangster Squad would be a crime against cinematic sensibility."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,30,"This movie made my ears hurt. Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and James Ellroy could have turned this pulp into insinuating jazz. What's here is a cartoonish bore."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,25,"In lieu of any sharp insight into the period and its notorious figures, the film's brash, ultraviolent encounters instead build a showy exterior with nothing of import left standing."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,25,"Ruben Fleischer's film is a perfect example of Hollywood hypocrisy, something to be ignored diligently."
Gangster Squad,6.7,46000903,25,"His (Fleischer) first feature, ""Zombieland,"" was a half-witty genre parody. This one might be described as genre zombie-ism: the hysterical, brainless animation of dead clichés reduced to purposeless, compulsive killing. Too self-serious to succeed as pastiche, it has no reason for being beyond the parasitic urge to feed on the memories of other, better movies."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,100,"By allowing viewers to step into the shoes of a wall-climbing Jackie Chan, a parkour-sprinting Daniel Craig or a bullet-spraying Ahnold, it does something that live action has never attempted before. The carnage flies—it’s possible to miss a lot of it. But if action movies are meant to be stunning, Hardcore Henry can proudly take its place among the giants. Even better, it lets you stand with them."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,78,The film is an exhilarating and inventive spectacle that makes every other action film from the last 10 years look as obsolete as the Lumière brothers running that train at you back in 1896.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,75,Is it much of a movie? Not really. It’s more of an experience – a passive sort of virtual reality – that uses a bare-bones narrative as a vehicle for a big-time body count.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,75,"A head-spinning, whirling dervish of an action movie."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,75,The film's unbelievably precise choreography of action seeks to tap into a universal feeling of powerlessness.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,70,"Hardcore feels like umpteen post-“Star Wars” action blockbusters trash-compacted into one — and whether that fundamentally appeals or not, the ingenuity of effort is undeniably high."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,70,"Hardcore blasts along like a supercharged computer-game shoot-em-up, bursting with sick humor and splatterpunk violence."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,67,"It feels longer than 90 minute because, despite changing locations frequently enough, Ilya Naishuller‘s debut feature never really has a strong sense of structure nor escalation to make it as truly kinetic as it wants. Yet, at least to some degree, the right spirit is there to lift it through some of the deadening stretches."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,65,"Presented with a moral universe where annihilation is all, it’s difficult to invest in the film as anything more significant than a breathless series of punishing vignettes."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,63,"It's all about the ride, the relentless wallop and whoosh. But, hey, sometimes that's all a cine-junkie needs for a fix."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,63,"Hardcore Henry is like a good roller-coaster in that it does not require a complex reason to be: it's there, it's fun, you ride it, and that's about it."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,58,"It never crystallizes into a singular experience, and instead collapses in a rush of well-intentioned innovations."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,You have a movie with everything it needs save one crucial element: emotion.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,A hypercaffeinated first-person action flick that teeters somewhere between gonzo insanity and a nausea-inducing endurance test.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"The sense of goofy, if gory, good humor [Copley] brings to Hardcore Henry goes a long way toward mitigating the film’s tedious barbarity."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"When the action is at its sharpest, such as with Henry’s mid-chase leap from a detonating truck onto the back of a motorcycle, it’s spectacular."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"If one can accept the story’s videogame logic and cope with the kinetosis, “Hardcore” is often exhilaratingly extreme."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,The film starts to risk adrenaline fatigue after the first hour.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,50,"Shot with head-mounted GoPro cameras, the Russian-made action flick Hardcore Henry mimics the experience of watching someone else play a very derivative first-person shooter with sub-Duke Nukem humor."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,42,"Sure, there's a bit of spectacle to the film's utterly ridiculous violence. Even that dulls, however, without character or stakes to inject urgency into the parade of broken bodies."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,Hardcore Henry is a single-gear novelty that never achieves real liftoff.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"Its dour eccentricity gives Hardcore Henry a potency above and beyond that of standard-issue show-off action fare. That doesn’t mean it’s not still obnoxious, though."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"The film turned out to be plodding and boring. No one can accuse Hardcore Henry of being plodding. It does get to be boring, but in the high-tech, cutting-edge mode of first-person-shooter videogames that dazzle your eyes, spark your synapses and numb your brain."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"The visuals are undeniably impressive at times, as Henry parkours around the city or during a particularly tense shoot-out, but they also struggle with inevitable motion sickness of the frenetic handheld camerawork."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,40,"Naishuller’s technique is one that could be well served as a shorter gimmick; a solitary action scene in a larger film. Hardcore is unrelenting and unforgiving in its commitment to be loud, fast, destructive and gross."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,38,"Never again let it be said that an action movie is just like a video game.
Hardcore Henry, a frenetic, dizzying, and ultraviolent actioner from Russian rocker-turned-director Ilya Naishuller is one - a first-person shooter writ large for the big screen."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,38,Hardcore Henry is jarring and so a-cinematic that I couldn’t enjoy much of the technical razzle-dazzle this ticking-clock monstrosity was hurling at me.
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,30,"While its audacity is laudable, the film ultimately has all the thrill of watching someone else play a first-person-shooter video game."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,25,"It’s breathtaking. It’s dazzling. It’s world-altering, is what it is. For the first time ever, a movie has actually done it. Hardcore Henry has precisely replicated the experience of watching someone else play a video game."
Hardcore Henry,6.7,9252038,0,"Stupid as a bag of hammers and twice as loud, Hardcore Henry sounds like the title of the worst Kissinger bio ever. Actually, it's an action movie that feels more like you are trapped in a video game. A really, really bad video game."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,72,"Breaking In is a clever twist not the home invasion genre, with a dynamic lead performance by Gabrielle Union as a mother protecting her family. It’s a crowd-pleasing thriller, good but never quite great, because the story collapses under scrutiny. The film is trying to be clever and yet it relies on big, and obvious gaps in logic, but those flaws probably won't ruin the experience."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,70,"Union, a conquering badass, owns it. The movie walks an intriguing line between strained believability and outright superherodom—a line every action movie walks, of course. But then, most action movies don’t star black women."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,63,"So, yes, the movie’s predictable, and writer Ryan Engle makes a lot of unforced dialogue errors."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,60,"With an overbearing score, Breaking In telegraphs almost everything that happens yet still provides several jolts amid its occasionally questionable twists. While the filmmakers aren’t exerting themselves to deliver anything other than a popcorn-seller, Ms. Union is working hard to keep you watching."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,60,These 88 minutes never drag their heels long enough for us to get hung up on their myriad implausibilities. One of those low-expectation releases that’ll see you right if Infinity War remains sold out.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,60,"The screenplay by Ryan Engle (“Rampage,” “The Commuter”) squanders its potential for emotional depth, making Breaking In a serviceable, but indistinct product."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"With more than a passing nod to the far classier ""Panic Room,"" this derivative seat-squirmer has a few good moments in spite of Johnny Klimick’s annoying score, its energy powered by the raw determination of its Mother Courage."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"Breaking In is a shallow nod to female empowerment, not the embodiment of it."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,The most disappointing part of Reverse Panic Room is how little it exploits its high-concept premise after spending so much time establishing all the particulars of this fortified lake house.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"The film’s sense of time lacks precision and urgency, and just having characters periodically point out that the clock is ticking doesn’t cut it."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"It’s a fun, pulpy premise, but sadly, the film takes a route that’s too silly to be taken seriously and too tame to be any fun."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"It’s not a bad idea and Union proves more than capable of nailing her Liam Neeson/Bruce Willis moment of save-your-family action stardom, but the movie has trouble sustaining interest even over its brisk 88 minutes."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,The disappointment of Breaking In is the wasted potential — there are a few plot setups that could have been further fleshed out or brought back around (why was her father being investigated by the DA?) and Union isn’t given enough opportunity to truly display her charms. This thriller could have really used some room to breathe.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,50,"If there’s a weakness to the movie, it’s that, despite its gut-level appeal, it doesn’t dazzle us with anything brilliant or unexpected. However, there are some nifty turns here and there, so it’s not entirely mediocre."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,42,"The full force of Union’s performance pushes the film to occasional crowd-pleasing results — give this woman a real action role, and fast — and Shaun’s ability to fight back is the one reliable element of an uneven film."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,40,"Union is committed and convincing, but the script apparently never met a cliche it didn't want to adopt wholesale. This offers some thrills and considerable pace, but never enough narrative force."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,40,"Union is capable of powering the film through, valiantly trying to plug the holes the high-concept plot can’t reach. She’s got that big screen charisma, even though, this time, she’s working with small-screen material."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,40,"Union certainly dedicates herself to all the huffing, running, jumping and emoting, though her efforts never counter Breaking In’s aura of trashiness and disposability."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,38,"There is a familiarity to its characters and story, which doesn’t do much at all in terms of reinventing the genre, but very much meets its own expectations."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,30,"Coasting for as long as it can on the considerable charms of its star, Breaking In is otherwise a work of profound half-assedness, running through the paces of its bare-bones framework with all the verve, energy and invention of a night-watchman winding down the last hour of his shift."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,Even on a technical level Breaking In is shockingly inept.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,James McTeigue's Breaking In is the sort of incompetently constructed thriller that gives B movies a bad name.
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,"The listless, leaden acting, writing and direction in this breathtakingly stupid bomb-ola defies audiences to stay conscious through its drag-ass 88 minutes."
Breaking In,5.4,46383120,25,"If there’s one thing that Hollywood thrillers and the legions of actors who march through them teach us, it’s that faking shock and breath-gulping panic isn’t easy. And hiding boredom, for some actors, is damned near impossible."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,90,"The James Bond production team has found its second wind with Licence to Kill, a cocktail of high-octane action, spectacle and drama...The thrills-and-spills chases are superbly orchestrated as pic spins at breakneck speed through its South Florida and Central American locations."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,88,"On the basis of this second performance as Bond, Dalton can have the role as long as he enjoys it. He makes an effective Bond - lacking Sean Connery's grace and humor, and Roger Moore's suave self-mockery, but with a lean tension and a toughness that is possibly more contemporary."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,88,"If Licence to Kill has one of Bond`s best heavies, it also has one of his best heroines in Carey Lowell, a strapping brunet who plays an ex-Army pilot reluctantly enrolled on Bond`s side. Lowell`s line readings may be only adequate, but she moves with the grace and vigor an action movie needs."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,80,"The series has been with us since 1962 and, like many another old timer, tends to repeat itself. Yet, every once in a while, it pulls in its stomach, pops the gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. The newest, Licence to Kill, is probably one of the five or six best of Bond."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,75,"Not since Dr. No has 007 been so cool and ruthless, and never has a plot been this close to realistic plausibility."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,75,"One of the best of the 16 Bond films, thanks to Dalton's athletic, tough and deadly new 007."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,70,"If Licence to Kill added more than just scenes with Q to lighten the load, if it provided a love interest as compelling as Vesper and more engaging than Lowell's whiny Pam Bouvier, this Bond could have been one of the instant greats, instead of one that is better appreciated with age. The movie is not perfect, but a lot of what works now in the series got its start in Dalton's last mission as James Bond."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,70,"Despite some shaky narrative continuity and muddled motivations, this manages to move pretty briskly, and the action sequences are generally well handled, especially at the climax."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,70,Licence to Kill continues the salvage operation begun in The Living Daylights and rescues a series that was in danger of shooting itself in the foot.
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"But this cruise is also a gruesome one. You may find yourself shaken -- not stirred -- by the screenwriting cruelty and cynicism behind the 16th ""Bond."""
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"As unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"Not as witty as The Living Daylights, but it doesn't let the audience down in the arena of effects, gadgetry, and locations."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,63,"For all its clever updatings, stylish action and witty escapism, Licence to Kill is still a little too much by the book. Mr. Dalton is perfectly at home as an angry Bond, and as a romantic lead and as an action hero, but he never seems to blend any two of those qualities at once."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,60,"Hardcore Bond fans may be dismayed by some of the changes, but no one can deny that the action scenes staged by director John Glen are some of the most spectacular of the entire series and well worth the price of admission."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,58,"Like ""The Living Daylights"", Licence to Kill definitely has its moments. But also like ""The Living Daylights"", the new, two-hour-plus picture goes on too long and is encumbered by a needlessly complicated plot."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"He may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"Drab in the extreme. Timothy Dalton's second and wheezing, final turn as 007 was barely recognizable as a Bond film."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"It's time to find a new Bond. This one is tuckered out, spent, his signature tuxedo in sore need of pressing...Dalton plays a straight-faced, humorless, no-nonsense Bond -- all guns and no play -- and it makes for a very dull time."
Licence to Kill,6.6,34667015,50,"The Bond women are pallid mannequins, and so is the misused Dalton -- a moving target in a Savile Row suit. For every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth."
RED,7.1,90380162,80,"Even the more cartoonish performances, like John Malkovich's acid-damaged paranoiac, fit the movie's vision of the vanished, wild-and-woolly heyday of spycraft."
RED,7.1,90380162,80,"Red isn't a great movie, but it's great fun, and if that sounds like damning with faint praise, you take things too seriously."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,One of those rare action comedies that actually delivers action and comedy.
RED,7.1,90380162,75,"It's a lot of fun and, because of the high quality of the cast, there's no need to feel guilty about praising such an inherently silly motion picture."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,"Red isn't edifying, ennobling, or artful.  It's just an utterly satisfying combination of big kicks, cheap thrills and real laughs."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,"This breezy action comedy is a noisy affirmation that life goes on after 50, that retirement doesn't mean redundancy, and that nobody - young or old - can wear a long cream evening gown like Mirren."
RED,7.1,90380162,75,The result is like a sugar rush after a visit to the vintage candy store.
RED,7.1,90380162,75,Red has more snappy joy in store than practically all of last summer's busted blockbusters.
RED,7.1,90380162,75,RED is so much fun -- and its Over the Hill Gang so likeable -- that this is one of those rare cases where I wouldn't mind seeing them come out of retirement again for another romp.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,"All those guys are a blast, and the dark-hearted idiocy of Red is mostly quite enjoyable."
RED,7.1,90380162,70,The best part of Red is the spectacle of terrific actors being terrific in novel ways.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,"Only a curmudgeon could entirely resist the laid-back charms of Red, an amusing, light-footed caper about a team of aging CIA veterans rudely forced out of retirement."
RED,7.1,90380162,70,Not the best. Not the worst. Just the classiest.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,To underestimate actors of this caliber -- even in a popcorn action flick -- would be dangerous indeed.
RED,7.1,90380162,70,"Part of it is cheap thrills, of course; this is a capable, experienced cast with extensive acting chops, and it's trashy fun watching them descend to the level of the material."
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"It's an amusing geriatric uprising that might just as well be titled ""Gray."""
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"RED is a poisoned valentine to the CIA, and that approach, too, is in keeping with its cold-war sentimentality."
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"There's no denying the kick you get from seeing Borgnine (forever lovelorn Marty to me, when he's not tooling around my head as Cabbie, from John Carpenter's Escape From New York) and company kick ass, take names, and go batshit crazy one last time."
RED,7.1,90380162,67,"Red starts repeating itself and spinning its wheels and looking for an ending, well before the ending arrives. The actors have considerable fun with it, though."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Too long, too busy, too loud, and too reliant on slam-bang stunt work, Red's glib dialogue and sinister government scenarios begin to wear."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Unlike ""Wild Hogs"" or last summer's ""The Expendables,"" this adaptation of the ""Red"" graphic novel series gets into a cool, sophisticated swing."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Red has enough acting flourishes and incidental action pleasures to make it an adrenalin-jacked giggle, if not exactly the romp one so fervently expects."
RED,7.1,90380162,63,Excels at bringing on the high-power pyrotechnics.
RED,7.1,90380162,63,"Good fun, and though it breathes hard in the second half, the ensemble has charisma to spare."
RED,7.1,90380162,60,"The film preserves many of Ellis's amoral one liners (best delivered by Malkovich and by Richard Dreyfuss as one of the villains), though as in much of his writing, the fun is discolored by a profound cynicism."
RED,7.1,90380162,60,"It's the casting, stupid!"
RED,7.1,90380162,60,"Unfortunately, while RED's stars may have gotten better with age, its many clichés have not."
RED,7.1,90380162,58,"""The Expendables"" trotted out the concept this summer, and it was good dumb fun - a nudge-nudge wink-wink '80s movie on steroids. RED is more self-consciously wacky, more stridently in your face, and more disappointing."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"Red can't stop itself from trying too hard to be hip. It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"Red is an insult to our memories and to our intelligence, an unfunny farce whose veteran cast is cashing a retirement check."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"It is possible to have a good time at RED, but it is not a very good movie."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"The uneven humor, half-baked plot and generic action scenes keep RED from being much fun."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,Red simultaneously tries too hard and not hard enough.
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"The star turns are Red's raison d'être, with the winking performances filling the place of any credible dramatic tension."
RED,7.1,90380162,50,Red is neither a good movie nor a bad one. It features actors we like doing things we wish were more interesting.
RED,7.1,90380162,50,"No one is expected to take any of this seriously, so Schwentke keeps things light: light on big laughs, light on unique action set pieces and light on any sense that these game but retired spies are too old for this crap."
RED,7.1,90380162,40,"The movie doesn’t have a funny bone in its body, clomping from one unoriginal set piece to the next with a head-scratching lack of urgency."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,100,"As both a simian simile and a wonder of technology, Rise of the Planet of the Apes deserves to be in the company of the great original ""Kong."" This year's sixth ""origins"" story of a fantasy franchise (after The Green Hornet, Thor, X-Men: First Class, Green Lantern and Captain America: The First Avenger) is also the year's finest action movie."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,100,This summer's best popcorn flick.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,90,"Smart, fun and thoroughly enjoyable, it's a model summer diversion that entertains without insulting your intelligence."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,90,"Judged, though, as the action extravaganza it means to be, Rise of the Planet of the Apes wins high marks for originality, and takes top honors for spectacle."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,88,"Audacious, violent and disquieting, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a summer sequel that's better than it has any right to be."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,83,"It's the rest of the movie, especially a grin-inducing final third, which makes ""Apes"" rise above the level of a typical sci-fi rehash."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"By far the best spectacle movie of the season, and one of the few films to use digital technology for nuanced dramatic effect."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"A worthy, exciting, emotional addition to the venerable monkey movie marathon. Apes will rise. Sequels are likely."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"As tight as the parallel homo sapiens storylines are lax, Caesar's prison conversion to charismatic pan-ape revolutionist is near-silent filmmaking, with simple and precise images illustrating Caesar's General-like divining of personalities and his organization of a group from chaos to order. All of this is shown in absorbing, propulsive style, as Caesar broodingly bides his time like a king in disguise awaiting restoration."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,Whereas the original was a work of speculative science fiction - a chin-stroking fable about evolution in the nuclear age - this revisiting of the Planet of the Apes myth is an animal-rights manifesto disguised as a prison-break movie.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,80,"Strong action, special effects and by far the most credible ape ""performances"" yet seen will spell box office to inspire chest-thumping in all markets."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"It's faint praise to say that this is the best of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, because the evolution of special effects and makeup was predictable. But the unexpected strength of the film is its heart."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The running time is efficient, the direction is clean, the story is simple but resonant, the effects are understated yet impressive, and the near-wordless star of the show puts on an acting clinic. Damned if the risen one doesn't lift us out of our seats."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The cautionary tale feels surprisingly fresh and entertaining, given that this is the fifth ""Planet of the Apes"" film since the 1968 original."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The movie rises and, at times, even soars. This is all - and I do mean all - thanks to what human actors in league with computer technology can now achieve to bring the apes to life. No more guys squeezed into monkey suits and talking in posh accents. Performance-capture makes all the difference."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"Rise is very consciously a drama about a Simian Spring, and it's close enough in its details to a recent documentary to be thought of as ""Project Nim: The Revenge."""
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,A shamelessly fun B-movie with A-movie effects.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"While it's effects-heavy, the movie itself does not feel heavy. Consider it a fanciful extension of the recent and very fine documentary ""Project Nim."""
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,Wyatt brings a light touch to the potentially grim material - too light when it drops in some groan-inducing references to the original film - but he keeps the action compelling whether focusing on apes as they run amok or as they quietly contemplate their next move.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,75,"The movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them. Caesar, to begin with, is a wonderfully executed character, a product of special effects and a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis, who earlier gave us Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings."""
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"It's good, canny-dumb fun."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"Compared to this summer's grab bag of superheros vying for a franchise, the apes rise (pardon the pun) to the challenge of making us care."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,I kind of enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes despite its evident silliness and the fact that nobody's likely to remember it three weeks from now.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"Thanks to stunning advances in performance capture technology, director Rupert Wyatt successfully ditches the cumbersome makeup appliances of past chapters, building the story around a cast of photoreal CG simians convincing enough to identify with as characters, rather than just special effects."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,70,"Once you see that ape, named Caesar, riding a galloping horse in triumph, it's awfully hard not to get sucked in. It's not dumb fun, exactly. It's smart dumb fun."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,67,"The movie is zippier than Tim Burton's oddly lifeless 2001 ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, but unlike good sci-fi, it doesn't signify anything, or really even try to."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,63,The central problem with Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it feels more like a piece of something larger than a complete motion picture.
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,60,"To showcase the special effects, the filmmakers reportedly trimmed many of the dialogue-based scenes, thereby dulling the dramatic impact of a strong genre premise."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,60,"The middle section of the story is where Rise truly takes off, perhaps in ways that will have viewers forgiving the rest."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,60,"Evincing more visible intelligence than any of his human co-stars aside from Lithgow, Caesar is disquietingly lifelike."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,58,"Feels like half of a good movie, much of it revealed in admittedly thrilling trailers."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"They probably should have called it ""Beneath the Dignity of the Planet of the Apes,"" but Rise of the Planet of the Apes is tolerable if you'll just keep in mind that the original feature was an overachieving B-movie."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"It is not what could be fairly called a bad movie, but neither is it fine enough to be a good one, with its lineup of dull characters and a limp story that functions like a conveyor belt."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"Now for the bad news. The filmmakers seem to have spent so much attention and, presumably, money on getting the primates right that they completely forgot about the people."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"Like the film that constrains him, a prequel to Planet of the Apes, perhaps James Franco understands his performance as something that will one day evolve into something far greater."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,50,"James Franco looks more bored and distracted in Rise of the Planet of the Apes than he did when he was hosting the Oscars: Watching the movie, I kept waiting for him to pull out his iPhone, aim it at the camera and take a snapshot while mugging sheepishly. Has there ever been a film with a less engaged protagonist?"
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,45,"Too earnest and dour to be a silly bit of summer fun, but it's not exactly scientifically sound, either."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,42,"Since the only really good ""Planet of the Apes"" movie was the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, I've always wondered why filmmakers can't just leave well enough alone."
Hokseongtalchul: Jinhwaui Sijak,7.6,176760185,40,"Hell, even Heston's performance elicited cheers back in the day. Franco, in a totally, tonally different role, but still the prime human here, is a pale shadow of the ruined future to come."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"Chow's savagely funny cinematic love letter places Hong Kong legends Yuen Wah, Leung Siu Lung and former Bond girl Yuen Qiu in well-cast pivotal parts, establishing Kung Fu Hustle not only as an endearing homage to a genre's history, but an astonishing piece of cinema in its own right."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,Kung Fu Hustle is something you rarely encounter in theaters: a genuinely original comedy.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"With a delirious mix of the sublime and the silly, Hong Kong comedy king Stephen Chow Sing-chi has taken the kung fu comedy genre to new heights of chop-socky hilarity."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"The movie refers glancingly to dozens of Hollywood classics, from ""West Side Story"" to ""City Lights,"" but at heart it is a debt of honor richly paid by Stephen Chow to his martial-arts forebears and to the traditions that shaped his sensibility. His gong fu is the best."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"Moviemaking doesn't get much smarter, funnier, handsomer, better than this."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,100,"It's a short, sharp, shock to the cinematic system that's virtually impossible to dislike, and if you don't leave the theatre grinning your face off, then buddy, movies just aren't for you."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,91,"All of Kung Fu Hustle is like that: You don't just watch it, you ride with it, laughing all the way."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,91,"It's a visual feast that only a crack director could provide, and it's mounted within a story and setting that, played utterly straight, might still have made a good movie."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,90,"Brilliantly choreographed and shot, Kung Fu Hustle is often grisly, visually spectacular and unabashedly silly, sometimes all at once."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,88,"Gut-Bustingly funny moves are pretty rare, so hustle over to Kung Fu Hustle, actor-director Ste phen Chow's exhilaratingly hilarious and affectionate send-up of Hong Kong action flicks."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,88,"Raymond Wong, who has become Chow's favorite composer, iced this cake with music that sounds like Beethoven, Henry Mancini's jazz and all the James Bond themes run together in a blender."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,88,"Guaranteed to deliver more innovative eye candy and smarter fun-per-second than most of this summer's fare, and that one-two punch ought to knock you off your seat."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,83,"In a farce like this, where the story is merely a string of martial-arts movie cliches lined up to be parodied, that has its own rewards."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"Half-amazing, half-ridiculous, thoroughly exhilarating."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"Its crowd-pleasing, action-packed brand of frenetic parody promises to spread Chow's mythos even further."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,Chow manages to have his cake and eat it too: Kung Fu Hustle is a kung fu parody that's also a terrific kung fu movie.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,Defies all laws of gravity in its pursuit of thrills and laughs—and it's so disarmingly eager to please that only a stone-faced kung fu purist could object.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"The inspiration appears to be equal parts ""Looney Tunes"" and Capcom video games like ""Street Fighter II."" All the energy that was missing from the recent ""Mask"" sequel is here, and then some."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,It won't be long before you feel the compulsion to watch again. There is too much to appreciate in one sitting.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,80,"Kung Fu Hustle pummels ""The Matrix"" trilogy into a puddle."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"Viewers will discover that the film has something to offer nearly everyone, whether they are a novice or a black belt in kung fu cinema."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,Does the plot spin out of control? You bet. But dumb fun this smart is a gift.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,For all its excitement Kung Fu Hustle is mostly a marvel of comedic ingenuity and mile-a-minute creativity run wild. You've never seen anything like it.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,Hustle's approach to a simple good-vs.-evil plot is eccentrically exuberant.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"Kung Fu Hustle is to ""House of Flying Daggers"" what ""Blazing Saddles"" is to ""Unforgiven."""
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"Like a meal prepared by an extreme chef, ''Hustle"" is more than a bit of a mess. It still tastes like nothing you've ever had before."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,This is the kind of movie where you laugh occasionally and have a silly grin most of the rest of the time.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,Vivid and madcap but fails to connect on any emotional level.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,75,"A celebration of Hong Kong action cinema that mocks gravity, both emotional and physical."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"For all its punches, kicks, whacks and thumps, the movie does not have much impact, and for all its affectionate nostalgia, it produces a strange kind of amnesia. It knocks the sense right out of your head, and its own as well."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"Chow depends way too much on jokey computer graphics that make the whole thing feel like a superhero comic, instead of athleticism or charisma or good storytelling, and that Kung Fu Hustle wears itself out long before it's over."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"At times, the picture evokes such stylized musicals as ""The Band Wagon""; at others, it seems to whirr every kung-fu movie ever made into the most luscious action smoothie you'll ever imbibe."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,70,"Chow's newfound patience and attentiveness to stasis, tinged with nostalgia, are promising indications of where he's taking his art as he attempts to influence the commercial cinema that's long influenced him."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,63,The upside: Chow has energy and invention to burn. The downside: He doesn't know when he blisters his audience.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,60,"A giant leap forward in Stephen Chow's ongoing assault on Jackie Chan's status as reigning balletic clown-master of martial-arts mayhem, this extravagantly nutty crime comedy is a work of some kind of genius. Not everybody's kind of genius, to be sure."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,50,Devoid of genuine inspiration or involving character development.
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,50,"The overly broad martial-arts comedy Kung Fu Hustle was obviously made with skill and affection for its many cinematic sources, yet I found the tone, timing and emotional involvement off by just enough to irritate rather than enchant."
Kung fu,7.8,17108591,30,"For all its stylishness, verve and moments of visual poetry, the relentlessly punishing slapstick and overall cruel tone left me cold."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,83,"Battleship is a sound vessel floating in Hollywood's oil-slick sea of ""Transformers"" sequels and vampire riffs."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,75,An invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,70,"Here's an audacious, inventive and character-driven blockbuster with some wit sprinkled in for good measure. It's fun, and filled with a surprising degree of intrigue and suspense."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,70,"And when the F-14s came out for a triumphant flyover, I looked around the room to find the moron who was applauding only to realize that it was me."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,63,"The nicest touch is that Battleship has an honest-to-God third act, instead of just settling for nonstop fireballs and explosions, as Bay likes to do. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's say the Greatest Generation still has the right stuff and leave it at that."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,One of the more enjoyably terrible movies of the year.
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"It's no ""Das Boot,"" but Battleship is a boatload of popcorny fun."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"The movie drags on way too long, but there are things to like."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,60,"Those looking for big, loud sci-fi action will find plenty to like here as director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) pumps up the volume on clashing military hardware and flag-waving heroics."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,55,"Actually, the picture is perhaps not quite as painful as you might be expecting, though probably not as enjoyable, either."
Battleship,5.8,65422625,50,"The story, by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber, who also penned the clever, quippy, aging-assassin movie ""Red,"" is cleverer and quippier than it has any reason to be, even if it makes not the remotest sense."

Noah,5.8,101200044,91,"Despite wild deviations in spiritual themes and execution, nothing in Noah approaches sacrilege or surrender, making this an acutely sensible biblical epic. It may simply be too strange for the masses to notice."
Noah,5.8,101200044,90,"Darren Aronofsky brings wild ambition and thrilling artistry to one of the Old Testament’s best-known, most dramatic, least plausible stories — Noah and the ark — with Russell Crowe infusing the role of God’s first seaman and zookeeper with all his surly majesty."
Noah,5.8,101200044,90,"Darren Aronofsky wrestles one of scripture's most primal stories to the ground and extracts something vital and audacious, while also pushing some aggressive environmentalism, in Noah."
Noah,5.8,101200044,88,"This is a Noah for the 21st century, one of the most dazzling and unforgettable biblical epics ever put on film."
Noah,5.8,101200044,83,"Darren Aronofsky's Noah is not just one of the most ambitious films I've seen this year, it's one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen."
Noah,5.8,101200044,83,"Overall, Noah represents a respectful take on an old story by filmmakers who pose a pertinent question. The Creator promises never again to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth, signing that covenant with the cheering image of a rainbow. Does that mean he won’t let us wipe ourselves out millennia later, if we’re hell-bent on doing so?"
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Aronofsky’s first bona-fide blockbuster is a sweat-stained labour of love. Audacious and uncompromising, it’s a legitimate epic."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Aronofsky’s sixth film is not the Noah you know, but a hundred-million-dollar Chinese whisper; a familiar story made newly poetic and strange with a flavour that’s less Genesis than Revelation."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,Noah manages to blend the expected with the unexpected and does it with so much gusto and cinematic energy you won't want to divert your eyes from the screen.
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Noah can be silly or sublime, but it's never less than fascinating. I was on board from start to finish."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Taken strictly as a piece of filmmaking, Aranofsky's Noah is ambitious. And as theology, well, it may not hew exactly to the letter of the law, but the spirit survives intact."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Inventive, ambitious, brutal and beautiful: a potent mythological epic. But also wilfully challenging, as likely to infuriate as inspire, whether through its unmitigated Old Testament harshness or its eco-message revisionism. If only more blockbusters were like this."
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,It is never less than fascinating — and sometimes dazzling — in its ambitions.
Noah,5.8,101200044,80,"Darren Aronofsky's Noah is the Old Testament on acid. It's the movie equivalent of Christian death metal. It's an antediluvian Lord of the Rings, fist-pumping, ferocious, apocalyptic, and wet - very wet."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Noah is more of a surrealist nightmare disaster picture fused to a parable of human greed and compassion, all based on the bestselling book of all time, the Bible, mainly the Book of Genesis."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Viewers may not agree about what they’ve seen when they come out of Noah. But there’s no doubt that Aronofsky has made an ambitious, serious, even visionary motion picture, whose super-sized popcorn-movie vernacular may occasionally submerge the story’s more reflective implications, but never drowns them entirely."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"If we want a bigger picture, we’ll have to wait for God to green-light “Noah: The Next Generation.”"
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,Holy ship! Crowe’s grumpy Noah and his dysfunctional clan help God reboot the too-wicked world in this imaginative (but hardly sacrilegious) and visually spectacular elaboration on Genesis.
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Hold off on burning Aronofsky at the stake till you see Noah, a film of grit, grace and visual wonders that for all its tech-head modernity is built on a spiritual core."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"The film is best when it isn't trying to be an action epic, but is simply being a character study. Here stands a man, asked to prepare for an unspeakable thing by an unknowable presence."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Noah is no silly action blockbuster with a Biblical pretext. Rather, it's the product of writer-director Darren Aronofsky's vigorous engagement with the Biblical story and what it might mean in our time."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"Will Noah anger some rigid purists and scholars because of the liberties it takes? Perhaps. But the point to take home is the message the movie leaves you with, which works regardless of your faith (or lack thereof). Humans are inherently flawed. How we deal with those defects is what truly matters."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"It isn’t “The Ten Commandments” and Crowe is no Charlton Heston. But Noah makes Biblical myth grand in scope and intimate in appeal. The purists can always go argue over “God Isn’t Dead.” The rest of creation can appreciate this rousing good yarn, told with blood and guts and brawn and beauty, with just a hint of madness to the whole enterprise."
Noah,5.8,101200044,75,"All of which makes the film Noah psychologically credible — his behavior is very much what you might expect of a man who has just condemned millions of screaming souls to watery graves. And it makes the film unpredictably suspenseful, which is dramatically the most welcome thing you could ask of a biblical epic."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"There’s so much delusion and so much delight in Noah that I have trouble distinguishing one from the other, or determining whether its most outlandish flourishes qualify as mistakes or as strokes of genius."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"Mr. Aronofsky’s earnest, uneven, intermittently powerful film, is both a psychological case study and a parable of hubris and humility. At its best, its shares some its namesake’s ferocious conviction, and not a little of his madness."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"It’s an unwieldy, sometimes overreaching effort, but the laudable ambition makes it easy to forgive some rough patches."
Noah,5.8,101200044,70,"Aronofsky’s story of Noah and his ark is far-removed from our collective recollections of Sunday school pageants and Cecil B. DeMille extravaganzas. Instead, this film opts for the sort of human-scaled realism that almost allows us to smell the dank stench of a menagerie cooped up for 40 days and nights on a water-swept barge."
Noah,5.8,101200044,67,"The result is a monolithic slab of Biblical fan fiction, at once deeply serious and seriously silly. It’s a mess, but at least it’s the mess its creators wanted."
Noah,5.8,101200044,67,"The movie as a whole is a mixed bag. It's overlong and a times sluggish. The fights and battles, designed to give an epic fantasy feel to the movie, are grave miscalculations."
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,Noah is no by-the-book Bible story. Think of it as a visually mesmerizing sci-fi adventure saga loosely based on the book of Genesis.
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,"Noah is equal parts ridiculous and magnificent, a showman’s folly and a madman’s epic."
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,"Neither fish nor fowl, neither foul nor inspiring, director and co-writer Darren Aronofsky's strange and often rich new movie Noah has enough actual filmmaking to its name to deserve better handling than a plainly nervous Paramount Pictures has given it."
Noah,5.8,101200044,63,"Impressive as much of his film is, however, Aronofsky never quite solves the main challenge of the semi-literal biblical adaptation: what is so economical, and beautifully expressed, on the page can become a heavy, lumbering beast when translated into conventional narrative."
Noah,5.8,101200044,60,"It’s Aronofsky’s least personal work. So you get a fat dose of conventional melodrama with your Old Testament: It’s the antediluvian ""Gladiator."""
Noah,5.8,101200044,60,"Noah is a movie about big ideas (environmentalism, heavenly obedience versus earthly love) and even bigger directorial ambitions (how to tell a personal story on the grandest of grand scales). But, in the end, it's also a disappointment. Maybe not one of Biblical proportions, but a disappointment nonetheless."
Noah,5.8,101200044,58,"When focused on the natural world and the internal thoughts of its characters, Noah positively crackles with the energy of a filmmaker inspired by a new perspective on classic material... But the latter half of the film, turgid and hamfisted throughout, cripples the film so severely that it makes one thankful for the added elements to Noah’s story."
Noah,5.8,101200044,58,"The director’s vision is so dark — and Mr. Crowe’s grumbling, sour-stomach persona so much like a Tums commercial — that you don’t care much what happens to him or his ark, which looks like a big barge with a stove pipe in the middle."
Noah,5.8,101200044,50,"Once the money shots of Darren Aronofsky's version recede, it becomes ever more clear that his intention is to tackle the capriciousness of Old Testament logic. And, ultimately, to assent to it."
Noah,5.8,101200044,50,"The director's murky, ill-conceived take on the world's oldest disaster story contains some of the most pristine visuals produced on a mass studio scale in some time. But it's also constantly tethered to a dull, melodramatic series of events out of whack with any traditional interpretation of the material."
Noah,5.8,101200044,50,"Noah is here not to set the record straight, but to set it on its head. This isn't a lavish work of mad genius, it's a movie designed to be a lavish work of mad genius, and there's a difference."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"Darren Aronofsky’s big-ticket retelling of the biblical legend of Noah (Russell Crowe, so damn serious) is a wildly stupid, yet still train-wreck-fascinating piece of work."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"The execution of that script – is so clumsy and over-written that nothing in it sticks. There’s a symphony of visuals here, and big strange ideas, but when it comes to the actual characters, we get automatons sleepwalking through clichés."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"Noah, Darren Aronofsky’s often ludicrous, occasionally thoughtful epic, puts theology front-and-center, and doubles down on its blockbuster ingredients — like adding huge rock monsters with glowing eyes."
Noah,5.8,101200044,40,"What could have made Noah work is the same sense of urgency – of fateful craziness – that made ""Pi"" so memorable, and which also factored into the fatal obsessions of ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"" (two very flawed movies that admittedly benefited from stronger lead performances than the one here)."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,75,"Katniss and Tris might still be queen bees of the genre, but Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) and his fellow Gladers find a satisfying, teen-friendly way to combine rebellion, politics, science and a lot of jogging for a broad audience."

Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,The visuals of a blasted city are impressive but hardly reason to spend $10 to sit in a theater seat and watch a bunch of underdeveloped characters get chased by zombies for an inordinate amount of time.
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"On a thematic level, it remains wholly reprehensible and a fraudulent piece of entertainment. But at least it rips off some better films (Mad Max, Day of the Dead, The Matrix) with a good deal of energy."

Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"In Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, selfish oldsters scheme to rob young people of their vital essence, sacrificing them in the process. It’s basically “Social Security: The Movie.”"

Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Though Ball's workmanlike handling of the second in the trilogy, ""The Scorch Trials,"" proves mainly that he can keep a franchise from running completely off the rails when the tracks have been laid perilously near a swamp of ""dys-lit"" cliches."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"Left without a gimmick, The Scorch Trials wanders between YA cliches — there’s a Resistance, but it’s unclear what they’re resisting — and zombie movie tropes, with the obligatory a zombie bit our friend scene."

Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"With more action and less mystery, a returning director and main cast and a handful of sketchy new characters, The Scorch Trials makes for an efficient yet uninspiring sequel."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,50,"The Scorch Trials offers virtually no character development and only hints of plot advancement, mostly just functioning to move a group of obliquely motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,42,"Director Wes Ball’s adaptation of the second book in author James Dashner’s popular series is the exact opposite of its predecessor, presenting a sprawling adventure that, when not liberally cribbing from more illustrious sci-fi forefathers, spends plentiful time fleshing out the dull details of its oppressed-youth scenario."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,40,"The Scorch Trials adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre, but it’s at least less ponderous than its predecessor. The many chases and ludicrous narrow escapes offer respectable doses of adrenaline."

Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,38,"Every set piece brings to mind an Epcot Center attraction built from borrowed parts, geared toward reinforcing the young audience's belief that adults just don't understand them."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,30,"The trouble comes when somebody opens their mouth and you’re reminded this is supremely silly stuff, and overall a much lesser version of teens versus the titans of post-apocalypse industry – a copy of a copy of a copy."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,20,"This film is making a wheezing, spluttering sound: the sound of a profitable YA franchise running out of steam."
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6.3,81697192,20,"One of the most tedious apocalypses to come down the chute in recent years, this series gets lamer, and lazier, with each entry. The only ‘Trial’ offered by this film is the ordeal of watching it."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,83,"Once one is acclimated to this chaos-cinema form, even if it’s a bit more assaultive in post-converted 3D, the writer-director’s simultaneous economic storytelling and boyish imagination come into clear view."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,75,"Like most films of its type, “The Final Chapter” is utterly ridiculous in every possible way but unlike a lot of them (I am looking at you, “Underworld”), it at least has a healthy sense of its own absurd nature that comes as a blessed relief. And a couple of the action bits are gloriously goofy to behold."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,75,"For fans of “Resident Evil,” I believe this final film will not disappoint, but it also will likely encourage newcomers to the saga to go back and play a bit of catch-up by watching the earlier movies."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,67,"The climax makes for a satisfying conclusion to the franchise—an ending which this writer expects, and even hopes, all concerned will studiously ignore when they get around to making the next one."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,66,"For the first time, the story supports and adds to the action rather than distract from it; it’s almost as though Anderson was holding back in the earlier films because he wanted to save the best for last."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,63,The Resident Evil films are so unconcerned with traditional character and narrative that they suggest either abstract art or the fevered brainstorming of a child at play.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,There’s no denying the movie’s climactic gathering of females bent on saving the species.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,"Boasting a higher body count than its IQ, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is violent, idiotic fun."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,60,"The movie percolates enough that even when, at its climax, it shamelessly recycles a grisly punch line from 1987’s “RoboCop,” it’s kind of endearing, not least because Mr. Anderson and company make it work."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,58,Combining Anderson’s symmetrical camera style with frenetic editing ends up imploding the sense of depth and space that has long made the director’s movies must-sees in 3-D.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,50,"Jovovich binds the episodic action sequences, her face a mask of noble pain and isolation. She outruns zombies, orchestrates catapults of flaming gasoline, literally slays a dragon with a Hummer – and all without a single unnecessary quip or wasted kiss."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,50,"A few individual scenes of hand-to-hand and foot-to-face combat are undeniably exciting, and Jovovich once again impresses with her kinetic athleticism. Overall, however, the repetitiveness and occasional incoherence of the nonstop action leave the audience exhausted for all the wrong reasons."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,Reasonably entertaining but hectic (supposed) finale for the up-and-down series.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"Hush and patience are simply not in Anderson’s vocabulary. He bombards you as if terrified of encroaching tedium, and the set pieces trip each other up in their sheer haste."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"The action is practically non-stop from beginning to end, but is never remotely exciting due to the Cuisinart-style editing that reduces it all to an incomprehensible, messy blur."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,40,"True, the movie's intense, and Jovovich is certainly in fighting shape. But after 15 years of this franchise, it's getting hard to tell Alice from the things she's fighting. It's all squint and grunt, slash and groan."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,30,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter proves that there's nothing left in the tank of this grossly nondescript zombie-shootin' franchise.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,25,There’s a fascinating satire of America’s unholy alliance of heartless corporations and the religious dupes who worship them just sitting here. But it’ll take a wit far cleverer than action hack Paul W.S. Anderson to work that out.
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5.6,26830068,20,The film is drab and epileptic.
Death Wish,7.0,22000000,75,In Death Wish we get just about the definitive Bronson; rarely has a leading role contained fewer words or more violence.
Death Wish,7.0,22000000,60,"The sense of location is strong, emphasising a hostile, nightmarish terrain; but Winner's recourse to caricature when dealing with police and thugs, and his virtually overt sympathies with the confused, violent Bronson, make for uncritical, simplistic viewing."
Death Wish,7.0,22000000,60,"Death Wish is so cannily fabricated that it sometimes succeeds in arousing the most primitive kind of anger. Yet it's a despicable movie, one that raises complex questions in order to offer bigoted, frivolous, oversimplified answers."
Death Wish,7.0,22000000,50,"The violence is excessive and the plot predictable, although there is some style to director Winner's approach."
Death Wish,7.0,22000000,40,Poisonous incitement to do-it-yourself law enforcement is the vulgar exploitation hook on which Death Wish is awkwardly hung.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,100,"White House Down aims to be a low-brow slab of mindless summer fun. Most of the time, it comes pretty close to hitting the bull’s eye."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,80,"White House Down is still too gun-happy, and too long, but however you feel about the Oval Office, our country, or some of the movie's jingoism, young Emily is worth rescuing."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"Only in the last half-hour do the usual Emmerich absurdities pile up: I laughed outright at the character who, past 65 and diagnosed with a massive brain tumor that will kill him within months, cannot be stopped by a ferocious beating, being stabbed in the neck with a sharp implement, then being crushed against a wall by an SUV moving at a minimum of 30 mph."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"While White House Down isn’t going to score points for originality, seriousness, or subtlety (Emmerich likes his political messages blunt and loud), it is a lot of fun; if nothing else, Emmerich is a great widescreen showman who knows how to stage mayhem on a grand scale."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,You couldn’t ask for a more fun summer popcorn movie than White House Down.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,75,"Of all the dumb megabudget ""Die Hard""–like action pictures of the last few years (including that other White House Goes Boom movie, ""Olympus Has Fallen""), this is both the most entertaining and the most inviting of viewers' input."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,What makes White House Down not just tolerable but frivolously entertaining is its slapstick soul; a scene where the presidential limousine does doughnuts on the South Lawn plays like an homage to the Keystone Kops.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"White House Down is a hoot and a half, a shameless popcorn entertainment that is preposterous and diverting in just about equal measure."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"An action thriller that doesn’t know when to quit. For the most part, though, it remains preposterously entertaining."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"Itself owing much to such lone-man-of-action hallmarks as “Die Hard” and “Speed,” this welcome throwback to an earlier, more generously entertaining era of summer blockbusters delivers a wide array of close-quarters combat and large-scale destruction, all grounded in an immensely appealing star turn by Channing Tatum and ace support from imperiled POTUS Jamie Foxx."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,70,"White House Down is amply endowed with enough tension, humor, and calamitous action to ensure it a solid berth in the summer box-office sweepstakes. Channing Tatum comes into his own as a leading man in this picture, proving himself as a beefy yet agile action star and not just the pure beefcake of ""Magic Mike."""
White House Down,6.4,73103784,67,"Skip it, and you'll be depriving yourself of one of the summer's most satisfyingly stupid pleasures."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,67,"At best, White House Down is a sure-fire way to kill two hours, if not countless brain cells."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,65,"A buddy comedy disguised as a political thriller. It’s full of malarkey, but as a campaign of shock and awe, it’s hard to resist."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,"Intentionally or not, Roland Emmerich’s White House Down is the comedy hit of the summer. No other film equals its comic sophistication. Each nutty scenario is surpassed by the next, ludicrous story lines coalesce with expert orchestration, and absurd details return with perfect timing to build to a crescendo of hilarity."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,"While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios, the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,63,This bona-fide big-budget Hollywood flop at least has the good grace to laugh at itself as it rolls out the dingbat-daft action-movie cliches.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"The outcome may be pre-ordained, but Emmerich’s knack for a witty pop-culture reference, a pulse-pounding gun battle or a sneaky political undercurrent (the film has drawn fire in the US for being leftie propaganda) hasn’t deserted him."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,Lincoln meets Sudden Death: a corny but raucous throwback to when Planet Hollywood was hip. Gary Busey popping out of a rose bush wouldn’t feel out of place.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Longer than OHF and just as daft, WHD makes for a more entertaining watch before succumbing to the same bombastic overkill."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Even as the story accrues preposterousness, the action moves along crisply, and Tatum and Foxx hit a nice buddy-movie vibe."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"This is solidly a genre picture, and one that follows all the necessary conventions -- but it's also one that does it all very well. That means lots of big, dumb and loud action -- but it also means good, popcorny, summer fun."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"This piece of midsummer madness is undeniably silly and delusional, a dire political fable told as tongue-in-cheek pastiche."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"As demented and entertaining as promised, and a little less idiotic than feared."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Often, the hilarity is indisputably intentional. If you think you'll laugh and clap, try it; if you know you'll hate it, you're right."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,60,"Tatum muscles his way through the role with panache, while Foxx never gets a chance to break loose."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,58,"White House Down is nearly enough fun to be a bad movie that's a good time. But it always finds some way of being a drag, belching exposition and weak humor when action's all we need, then carrying the action to exhausting lengths."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,58,"White House Down is never more than a sliver away from gleeful self-parody. It’s pure patriotic kitsch, the cinematic equivalent of a black-velvet painting of a bald eagle clutching an American flag in its talons as it soars majestically over Mount Rushmore."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"The main flaw of White House Down is that it overstays its welcome, thanks in large part to a silly climax that seems to unfold in three laborious acts. At least, Tatum keeps his shirt off."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,It's probably not a good idea to examine the political content of a film in which the leader of the free world proves that the pen is mightier than the sword by stabbing someone in the neck with one.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"This sloppy mess also pales in comparison to the better-paced, taut ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" which represents 2013's better White House invasion story."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,Formula action films don’t come much more formulaic that this.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,This is getting old.
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"White House Down is a corker, real competition for “Fast & Furious 6″ as the dumbest fun you’ll have at the movies this summer."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,50,"Perhaps afraid that watching a symbol of liberty repeatedly go boom isn’t enough, Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt add family drama, an attack on Congress, a plane crash and the possible nuking of the Middle East. What isn’t tonally jarring ends up shatteringly inept."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,40,"White House Down never quite seems to decide what kind of movie it wants to be, although by firepower alone it qualifies as this summer’s most cartoonishly bombastic exercise in sensory overload (so far)."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,37,"The poster for this movie should read: Hello, Suckers!"
White House Down,6.4,73103784,30,"White House Down wants to riff on the stirring action crowd-pleasers of old. But instead of playing on those motifs, White House Down becomes a slave to them, turning into the very kind of rote, brainless, poorly choreographed and leaden action movie it wants to lighten up."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"Roland Emmerich makes love of country into a thing of unabashed hokum, which bleeds through every nook of this overstuffed jumble and leaves no character untouched."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"What played as rousingly dumb fun in ""Independence Day"" (1996) — all those pie-eyed nationalistic monologues, and U.S. landmarks reduced to rubble — now come off as callously insensitive, even with tongue firmly in cheek."
White House Down,6.4,73103784,25,"[A] cartoonish, offensive, overblown, clanging, steaming piece of ... cinema."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,100,"As a fictional, big-budget, 3-D, epic interpretation of Moses’ journey, Exodus: Gods and Kings is spectacular."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,90,"What’s remarkable about Scott’s genuinely imposing Old Testament psychodrama is the degree to which he succeeds in conjuring a mighty and momentous spectacle — one that, for sheer astonishment, rivals any of the lavish visions of ancient times the director has given us — while turning his own skepticism into a potent source of moral and dramatic conflict."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,80,"As spectacular and surprising as you would expect from Scott. Its spiritual uncertainty – and lack of triumphalism – perhaps robs it of a truly satisfying, cathartic conclusion, but also makes for a truly modern, thoughtful biblical blockbuster."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,80,Scott operates on a suitably Biblical scale and grounds the spectacle with rock-solid turns from Bale and Edgerton.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,75,"It’s not a question of believing it, exactly. Director Ridley Scott has simply made us want to be there, to wish we really were there, and to accept his illusion as the most ready answer to that desire."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,75,"Is it possible to sit through a movie, mentally cataloging its absurdities, and still walk out dazzled? Because that pretty much sums up my experience watching Ridley Scott's eye-candy spectacle Exodus: Gods and Kings, an over-the-top Old Testament epic that's essentially Gladiator with God."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,75,"For all its stunning and stark wilderness settings (Spain and the Canary Islands), its stunning effects, technical proficiency and scriptural cleverness, Exodus is a chilly affair... It’s still an exciting, entertaining epic."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,70,"As uneven as Ridley Scott’s career; at times, it seems to be a journey through the director’s greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out; the bad news is all the awkward storytelling and botched character interactions we have to wade through to get to the good stuff. Once we do, though, Exodus is a hoot."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,67,"Exodus is an entertainment of the first order. I’m not so sure about the filmmaker’s decision to render the Metatron archangel as a 9-year-old boy, but what the hell? You get hit on the head with a boulder, who knows what you’ll see?"
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"Scott’s “Exodus” is dutiful, deeply earnest, and more than a little dull."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"How you respond to the totality of Exodus: Gods and Kings will, I suspect, relate directly to how you responded to Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"" from 2010. Square, a little heavy on its feet, much of that film held me, even when its bigness trumped its goodness. Same with this one."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"In Exodus: Gods and Kings, Scott settles for sticking (mostly) to the Book, skipping the boring parts in order to dish out the razzle-dazzle. This is spectacular entertainment, practically a theme park ride, that could have used more spirituality and soul."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,63,"Exodus is a biblical epic that comes at you at maximum velocity but stays stirringly, inspiringly human."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"Whilst the tone is off, and the talented cast wasted, Exodus is, at times highly entertaining, albeit unintentionally."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"For all of the care and imagination that have been lavished on the production, which was designed by Arthur Max and photographed by Dariusz Wolski, the film’s impact is best expressed by frequent aerial shots that are visually impressive and emotionally remote."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"As with the DeMille ventures, enjoyment here involves managing expectations and not taking things too seriously."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"This is bold and uncompromising stuff from Scott; a Biblical epic to shake your faith in the order of things, not reaffirm it."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"It is half turkey, half triumph."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,60,"No movie with such a limp ending can be fully satisfying, and the beginning also falters.  But the long middle section is a rousing good show."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,59,"Even with exhilarating plague montages and stomach-dropping illusions of scale amid the many battles, the characteristically brilliant shots for which the famed director is known can’t compensate for the completely tone-deaf overall result—so far removed from the days in which the filmmaker brought us Alien."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,58,"When we last see a much older Moses en route to Canaan, we can at least be grateful that this film, unlike so many other movies these days, does not seem primed for a sequel."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"As for Bale, he seems to have lost his compass. His accent strays, his famous intensity wasted on clunky dialogue."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"At 2 1/2 hours, the movie is actually too short to adequately tell the full tale (The Ten Commandments is 70 minutes longer) but that doesn't prevent Scott from presenting multiple, seemingly endless scenes of people crossing deserts."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Exodus is ludicrous only by accident, which isn’t much fun and is the surest sign of what we might call a New Testament sensibility at work. But the movie isn’t successfully serious, either... To be fair, there is some good stuff here, too. Mr. Scott is a sinewy storyteller and a connoisseur of big effects."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,A handsome movie with a handsome leading man. Christian Bale is widely considered the finest actor of his generation. Yet here he’s adrift in the bulrushes. This might be the most indifferent performance of Bale’s career.
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"the performances, even from some really good actors, are wooden, the huge CGI effects are a distraction and the best thing about the movie is the one thing that, other than the casting, will probably make the most people angry: God is a kid."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Swarms of flies, oozing pustules, alligator attacks and gaggles of frogs are vividly rendered in three dimensions in Exodus: Gods and Kings. And yet this biblical epic is still bland, overly long and otherwise forgettable."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Scott loses the humanity amid all the gods and kings. The setpieces, however, elevate the film around them."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"If nothing else, Exodus: Gods And Kings makes it easier to appreciate Darren Aronofsky’s ""Noah,"" which, for all of its flaws, was at least animated by a personal relationship to the Old Testament."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"For a story that's pro-poor and anti-wealth, every frame of it looks like it cost as much as human life itself — and that, more than any bludgeoned battle cries for freedom, is the pleasure of the film."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,50,"Exodus: Gods and Kings illustrates a typical contradiction of commercial entertainment: By playing it safe, the movie fails to enrich the material, and never captures the energy that has made its narrative so captivating for millennia."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,47,"This stodgy adaptation creaks with solemnity — not to mention reactionary casting choices — and apart from some nifty frog and locust infestations, even the special effects pale next to a wind-blown Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,42,"As an action spectacular, Exodus is on par with Scott's other forays into ancient times, ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven."" But as a believable human drama, much less a worthy exploration of Judaism's origins, it falls flat."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,42,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is a creaky, sometimes painfully boring Old Testament slog, and finds the visionary director unable to successfully wrangle a human story out of a tale of gods and kings."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,38,"A numbing and soulless spectacle of 3-D, computer-generated imagery run amok, Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings presents an enduring tale by pummeling us over the head with it."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,38,"While the pale skin tones (bronzer is selectively applied) and haphazard mix of American and British accents is distracting, it barely scratches the surface of Exodus’s ungainly artificiality."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,38,"It doesn't take long to realize that Ridley Scott's adaptation is only aiming for certain forms of credibility, and callously eschewing others."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,33,"This is that rare case where it feels like every choice Scott made was off, and the cumulative impact of all of these choices is one of the most crushing disappointments of the year in terms of who made the film and how little of it works."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,25,"This biblical action drama that feels excessive in every way imaginable, from running time (nearly 2 1/2  hours) to melodramatic acting to the conspicuous amount of computer generation."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,25,"An utterly clueless, relentlessly grim and rambling action epic guaranteed to displease devout Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, amuse atheists — and generally bore everyone."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,25,"On the plus side, Scott's plagues are cool. But it's a long slog to crocodile rocking, pestilence and Proactiv-proof sores."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,20,"I can’t fault Ridley Scott for wanting to stage a version of this saga, just as I can’t ignore the fact that my dad tells the same tale every spring, but much more engagingly, in half the time and drunk on Manischewitz."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,6.0,65014513,20,"This eye-rollingly bad movie is silly, sluggish and miscast."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,75,"There are a lot of moments to remember in The Golden Child, but the one I will treasure the longest happens when Eddie Murphy gets behind the wheel of a beat-up station wagon and is led by a sacred parakeet to the lair of the devil."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,60,A non-movie that seems to wash over audiences without making any kind of impression. Except for those it does impress.
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"After his triumphant Beverly Hills Cop, Eddie Murphy could have done anything. Why, then, did he choose to head for the mysterious Orient to make a film as rich in mumbo jumbo as The Golden Child? Mr. Murphy's comic skepticism in the face of all this is the film's greatest asset. But it is worn thin by the awareness that not even he seems able to take the adventure seriously, and by the preposterousness and inconsistency of what surrounds him."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"As in Big Trouble, there is much playing around with oriental mythic nonsense: underground caverns, magic daggers, even a trip to Tibet. But where the movie really misses a trick is its inability to reproduce the balletic splendours of martial arts. The surprise is Murphy, who relies more on his undoubted charm than on the stream of wisecracks he usually delivers."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,50,"A strange hybrid of Far Eastern mysticism, treacly sentimentality, diluted reworkings of Eddie Murphy’s patented confrontation scenes across racial and cultural boundaries, and dragged-in ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) special effects monsters, film makes no sense on any level."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,40,"The action sequences are cloddishly orchestrated. And for the most part, the movie simply doesn't make sense."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,40,"A weirdly out-of-scale movie that constantly juxtaposes the trivial and the cosmic, less to comic effect than to a mounting sense of muddle and uncertainty."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,38,"Toying with themes too serious for it and stars too big for it, this fantasy is incalculably less than the sum of it's parts."
The Golden Child,5.9,79817937,25,"Eddie Murphy's latest is a flabby disappointment. The jokes die, the action curdles. Much of it falls as flat as smashed tinsel."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,88,"The richly constructed first hour is so superior to any feat of sci-fi speculation since ""Minority Report"" that the bland aftertaste of the chase finale is quickly forgotten."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,83,Farrell's diction is a noticeable upgrade from Schwarzenegger's but there's also his superior portrayal of sweaty apprehension and killer instinct.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,75,"Total Recall is well-crafted, high energy sci-fi. Like all stories inspired by Philip K. Dick, it deals with intriguing ideas. It never touched me emotionally, though, the way the 1990 film did, and strictly speaking, isn't necessary."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,70,"Total Recall is a doggone good time, with a bunch of nifty technical and visual flourishes, competently managed plot twists and elegant, Wachowski-esque action choreography that eventually becomes deadening because there's just too much of it and it's dialed up too high."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,67,"Director Len Wiseman is good on action, and Patrick Tatopoulus's dystopic production design is within hailing distance of ""Blade Runner,"" his chief influence. But essentially this is a big-screen video game."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,67,"Wiseman's PG-13 remake isn't as funny, or vivid, or splatter-tastic. It contains no mutants, inflating heads, trips to Mars, or freaky little psychic dudes named ""Kuato"" emerging from people's stomachs. But it does a decent job setting up an unsubtle dystopia."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,63,"Today's Total Recall does nothing to tarnish the image of yesterday's – 22 years from now, I expect it to be hailed as a classic."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,63,"Strip away the video-game visual effects, the endless chases and zero gravity shootouts, and Total Recall comes down to this: What is reality?"
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,63,"The movie marches in predictable formations as well. But when Biel's rebel pulls over in her hover car and asks Farrell if he'd like a ride, your heart may sing as mine did."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,60,Wiseman's Total reboot won't betray your fond memories of its iconic predecessor. But those hoping for a real head trip - a truly cerebral Dick adaptation - will have to keep waiting.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,60,"The outcome is engaging enough, although not entirely satisfying from either a genre or narrative standpoint, lacking both substance and a degree of imagination."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,55,"The two films have the same underlying bone structure, sure, but this new Total Recall is made of more serious, more humorless stuff. It looks simultaneously lavish and interchangeable in its explosions and shoot-em-ups with a dozen other recent action movies, and in its sci-fi stylings with a dozen others in the genre."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"Set in a high-tech yet shabby future, the remake of Total Recall is a fully realized piece of production design. But its script, credited to six authors, is more like a preliminary sketch."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"For all of its dazzlingly rendered cityscapes and nonstop action, this revamped Total Recall is a bland thing - bloodless, airless, humorless, featureless. With or without the triple-bosomed prostitute."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"So what makes this 2012 Total Recall superior to the Arnie model? For starters, there's an actual actor in the starring role."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"Instead of drawing the audience in, the action scenes merely blur together. And the intriguing, thoughtful concepts at the story's core are glossed over."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"The only laugh to be had in Total Recall, a ripsnorting sci-fi action extravaganza that starts well and works its way down to average, is in the opening credits, where we learn that the movie's primary production company is called Original Film. Really?"
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,This one is somberly kinetic and joyless.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"The new PG-13 movie is a fairly close adaptation of the Verhoeven, and lacks not just the earlier film's newness but its vigor, density, humor and R-rated juice. It's like the dinner-theater revival of a classic play, whose single asset is to remind those present how good the original was."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"I rarely pinpoint the exact moment when a promising action movie turns into a pulpy, asinine mess, but I can do that with Total Recall."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"Crazy new gadgets, vigorous action sequences and a thorough production-design makeover aren't enough to keep Total Recall from feeling like a near-total redundancy."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"This Total Recall is fast, furious, and frequently confusing fun, but to be completely honest, it lacks the snappy, weirdo vibe of its predecessor."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,50,"The biggest flaw of the 1990 Total Recall was how disappointingly banal the endgame was. Wiseman adds some special effects and Michael Bay-style pyrotechnics, but the result is similar. It's doubly deflating because one of the great advantages of remaking a movie is being given the opportunity to correct problems - something not attempted here."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,42,"A pastiche of almost too many movies to count as a remake of just one, Total Recall is mindless, middling fare that fails to utilize – much less expand – the provocative concepts at the core of its iconic 1990 predecessor."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,42,"Wiseman's Total Recall isn't intellectualized like ""Blade Runner,"" or even that much more sophisticated than his ""Underworld"" movies."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"It's a bit of a flavourless CGI-fest, without the character and comedy of the Arnie version, and it never really gets to grips with the idea of ""reality"" as a slippery, malleable concept."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"Perhaps no more absurd than the Verhoeven version, but certainly less amusing. Farrell and Beckinsale emerge unscathed, but the endless scrabbling for novelty and reinvention leaves this feeling unaccountably stale and familiar."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"Entertaining in small doses, but gruelling at two hours, Wiseman's derivative, spec-hackular upgrade bins the twisted wit and meaty thrills of the Arnie original."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"There isn't anything in this Total Recall to match the immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger send-offs, ""See you at the pah-ty"" and everyone's favorite alimony killer, ""Consider this a divorce."""
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"Like a drug that starts with a rush and ends with a headache, Total Recall is too much of a good thing."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"This premise contains the seeds of an interesting economic and political allegory, but the ambitions of the filmmakers - lie in the direction of maximum noise and minimum sense."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,Hardcore genre fans will likely be quite disappointed to find a film that trades vision and originality for something best described as bland and inoffensive.
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"There's a lot of eye candy in what ends up being a slick, breathless and at-times enjoyable sci-fi update. Unfortunately, it's what Wiseman forgets to do that makes the biggest difference in his film -- and which keeps it from becoming much more than a glossy missed opportunity."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,40,"It's big and it's loud, but ultimately not much more than that."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,38,"As for a villain, you could do worse than Bryan Cranston as the evil political overlord who is trying to stamp out the resistance -- When he goes mano a mano with Farrell, it's not spine-tingling. It's embarrassing, like watching a dude beat up his dad."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,38,"Len Wiseman's Total Recall's a trifling mess, as superfluous as a third breast."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,30,"Where Paul Verhoeven's original was testosterone-stupid and, therefore, fun, Wiseman's film is just boring-stupid."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,30,"The remake has no grace notes, or grace, no nuance, no humanity, no character quirks, no surprises in the dialogue and no humor."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,25,"The new Total Recall fails on the most basic levels: Its characters are dull, and its action is duller."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,25,"Since the new Recall is totally witless, don't expect laughs. Originality and coherence are also notably MIA."
Total Recall,6.3,58877969,20,There's something sadly poetic about a movie dealing with disappearing memories that vanishes from your mind while you watch it.
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,88,"What if Reagan’s America got a taste of her own interventionist foreign policies? Apocalypse, wow."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,75,"The film has some truly great right-wing anarchic moments, bur for the most part its politics are all too predictably – and only – militaristic, misogynist, racist, and xenophobic; for too much of its running time, it’s just a childishly simplistic masturbatory fantasy for right-wing hebephrenics that’s mostly safe enough to play the White House."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,75,"It packs plenty of rabble-rousing ammunition, but its sloppy execution is unlikely to win any merit badges for marksmanship."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,67,"As an action movie, Red Dawn is a repetitive headache, and anyone with Blue State sympathies will be appalled at its manipulations and exaggerations. But there's smart subtext beneath the big dumb explosions."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,Red Dawn is at once a mainstream shoot ‘em up action picture and an ideologically demented exercise in American paranoia.
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,"Director John Milius, the barbarian behind Conan, co-wrote this anti-gun-control, anti- Communist, survivalist script with Kevin Reynolds. Sick and silly as it is, the idea could have been intriguing, had it gone anywhere, which it didn't."
Red Dawn,6.4,38376497,60,"Another infantile right-wing fantasy from writer-director John Milius, this cinematic embodiment of the paranoid delusions of militarists, survivalists, and television evangelists is definitely a film for the Reagan era. Red Dawn is simply too
simplistic and inept to be taken seriously."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,75,"The movie suffers from being the same shape as so many modern blockbusters, and the plot in the second half of the film is basically another riff on the “reach the glowing doodad on a roof to prevent the end of the world” structure. But the focus on the Turtles and the film’s overall amiable sense of goofball humor carries the day."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,67,"Fortunately, Green’s sequel doesn’t have much interest in frustrations; this is a movie about unbridled joy, about transposing a cartoon veneer over a bleak human world."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,63,"""Out of the Shadows” isn’t going to win any awards, good or bad. Neither an embarrassment nor a triumph, it is nevertheless an improvement over the last film."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,63,"This sequel is a good improvement over the 2014 adventure that rebooted the franchise. The effects are better, the pacing is tighter and the overall impact is much more entertaining."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,60,"Does its best to include as much fan fodder as it does kiddie fare with the distinct personalities of the four Turtles — ""Mikey,"" ""Leo,"" ""Raph"" and ""Donnie"" — faithful enough to previous incarnations that both should be happier with the sequel over its predecessor."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,58,"So while Out of the Shadows may not be any smarter than the first installment (or really all that smart at all), it’s certainly a lot more fun."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,58,"While it’s not necessarily a good thing to aim this kind of weaponized marketing at kids, it’s also silly and colorful enough to nearly work as a live-action cartoon. It might rot brains, but perhaps not while regarding them with utter contempt."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"Its openly mercenary ethos initially scan as a bracing lack of pretense in a market crammed to the gills with insidious faux-sentimentality, but its overstuffed relentlessness proves almost equally tedious."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"They’re back for an entertaining enough 3-D sequel to their 2014 franchise revival, and so is the rest of the cast that includes foxy Megan Fox and her ability to wear a naughty schoolgirl outfit."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"This is a production from producer Michael Bay, master of the cinema of CG run amok. And all we helpless mortals can do is cower and duck as those 3D fists fly."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"This unambitious Michael Bay-produced version doesn’t seem interested in cleverness, cravenly settling for the usual generic CGI shtick."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,It’s surprisingly enjoyable even if you aren’t already in the bag for the turtles.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"Packed with better action sequences and a smidgeon more emotional resonance, this sequel may be more engaging than its predecessor, but the franchise remains a rather clattering and crude affair."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,50,"The film fares best when it slows down a bit and allows the Turtles' personalities, which are quite engaging, to shine through via their amusing comic banter."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,42,"Out of the Shadows stumbles from one set piece to the next, rarely offering viewers much reason to care in between, and its halfhearted attempts at moving toward the “dark and gritty” end of the comic-book spectrum never land."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,42,"Out of the Shadows’ barrels forward like such a rampaging beast that it decimates everything – plot, character, emotion, basic visual lucidity – in its wake."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"No groundbreaking cinemagic there, but Out of the Shadows’ oddball moments keep things weirdly surreal throughout."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"This movie is, it happens, easier to sit through than the 2014 film. The 3-D action, overseen by the director Dave Green, is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are even a couple of amusing, albeit unmemorable, sight gags and one-liners."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"True, Out of the Shadows is an improvement over the last Ninja Turtles movie, but only in the way that a mild cold is an improvement over the flu. It’s not good, but at least it’s not so terrible that it makes you want to lie in bed for a few days."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,40,"Considerably better than its predecessor, the central four may give it their all but the people behind this franchise sadly don’t seem all that interested in their crime-fighting, pizza-eating heroes."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,38,"Ultimately, any sass, sentiment and personality are obliterated in the noisy chaos of the climax, which is a grayish brown blur of flying spaceship parts, whirling turtle shells and shouts of ""the beacon!"" It's more cacophonous than cinematic, and loses the quirky charm of the cartoon in the avalanche of computer-generated violence."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,38,"It’s still just a patience-testing bauble for anybody over the age of 12. The Turtles, in this latest incarnation, were and remain shiny but stupid entertainment for kids."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,33,"To his credit, Green makes great use of wide-angle photography so the action feels comprehensible, with surprisingly long shots and effective editing. It’s just a shame the director’s talents are wasted on this brand-stamped mess."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,30,"Visual spectacle still takes precedence over coherent plotting, and the human characters retain all the gravitas of generic placeholders who accidentally made it into the shooting script."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"Cowabunga, the vigilante demi-gods on a half shell are back, and more inane and irritating than ever. Their antics make the 112 minutes it takes to watch this frenetic followup to 2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a torturous mindfuck for any sentient being over the age of  infancy."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"This is the kind of movie that leaves you with the impression that more thought was put into catchphrases and fan service than into a compelling plot, thoughtful characterizations or imaginative action choreography."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"A subpar 3D action comedy featuring four giant motion-capture animated turtles and a raft of human costars, including the dreamy-eyed Fox, wide-shouldered Perry, a remarkably slender Will Arnett, and Laura Linney, who looks tired and uncomfortable throughout the proceedings."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,25,"There are isolated moments of humor, and even charm. The visual effects are at times outstanding. But these positives are overwhelmed by the uninspired whole."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,20,"Forget cowabunga, this is cowadunga. Still, the Oscar for Most Shamefully Contrived Scene goes to the scriptwriters for managing to get franchise eye-candy Megan Fox into a sexy schoolgirl outfit, which, any shorter, would land the film with an R rating."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,6.0,82051601,20,"It’s soon clear that OOTS follows the model of Bay’s Transformers sequels. Longer, louder and boasting even more hardware, it does everything to generate the illusion of bleeding-edge bang-per-buck, while cribbing shamelessly from 1991’s Secret of the Ooze."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,75,"Hitman stands right on the threshold between video games and art. On the wrong side of the threshold, but still, give it credit."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,70,"The best movie derived from a violent computer game we've ever seen. You can take or leave that kind of qualified high-five, but, for us, it was a thoroughly entertaining experience. Think of bargain basement ""James Bond"" amped up into TV den-sittin', mouse-clickin' overdrive. But with human actors."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,70,"In the finest tradition of adolescent identification figures, he's not only ruthless, dispatching numerous baddies with hair-trigger shots to the head, but profoundly desexualized, brushing off the insistent come-ons of a slinky prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) he's taken under his wing."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Ultimately Hitman is about bullets, blood, and bombs. For die-hard fans of the videogame, there is much to relish in terms of cobblestone car chases, punishing fistfights, cool weaponry, impossible physical feats, and ear-popping gun battles that rage through exclusive hotels in exotic locations."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"As a movie on its own, it's simple monotony. Olyphant, affecting Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry voice, is about as menacing as Mr. Clean, and the action scenes - whether the weapons are fists, feet, swords or guns - fly past without any tension or suspense. Hitman is a miss."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"This violent action is stylish but painfully formulaic, even by the undemanding standards of video-game narratives."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"It's all meant, I suppose, to conjure up cold visions of Terminators and Robocops past, or, in this post-9/11 world, of bin Ladens and Bushes present. If so, conjure at will."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Not a spectacular movie, but the action scenes are well shot, there's no shortage of R-rated gore and the plot moves along quickly enough to mask the fact that the whole endeavor is completely ridiculous."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Here’s all you really need to know before the opening credits roll in Hitman: There’s going to be a lot of bloodshed. And that’s a good thing, considering there isn’t much dialogue to carry the film."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,50,"Essentially an episode of ""24."" Which may be a step up from a video game, but it's getting hard to tell."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,42,"The movie's one saving grace is Olyphant (""Live Free and Die Hard,"" HBO's ""Deadwood""), whose sociopathic elegance is gradually winning, and whose dry, monotonic, Eastwood-like delivery of one-liners is frequently, if perhaps unintentionally, very funny."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,38,"There have been plenty of movies adapted from video games before, but Hitman may be the first one that actually feels like a computer wrote and directed it."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,33,"By the time Olyphant leaves an enemy in the most ridiculous deathtrap since the '60s ""Batman,"" just because it looks kinda neat, the whole project has started to feel like ""Ultraviolet 2: The Further Stupidening."""
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"All the while, the music screams and clamors like an ignored child because director Xavier Gens and writer Skip Woods can't pump suspense into this inept mess."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"Hitman exploits every action-flick cliché imaginable and still manages to be dull. It’s bang, boom, blah -- action movies for bored dummies."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"While Gens can splatter gore with the best of them -- early in the film, a human body packed with C4 goes off in graphic detail -- he fails to stage so much as a single rousing action scene, even when he has four double-fisted swordsmen facing off inside an abandoned subway car. Game over. The audience loses."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,30,"Let's start with the obvious: Olyphant just isn't that intimidating an assassin. Think of some of cinema's more memorable button men: Léon, Luca Brasi, Frank Nitti...that's right, not a pretty boy in the bunch."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,25,Seeing Hitman isn't like playing a video game or even like watching someone else play a video game. It's like watching someone stupid play a bad video game.
Hitman,6.3,39687694,25,"Based on a videogame, Hitman could be the year's dumbest movie."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,20,"To be sure, Hitman is a lousy film, but like the video game that inspired it, it's also great fun, drawing as it does on everything from James Bondian Eurotrash panache to Vin Diesel's moribund XXX character."
Hitman,6.3,39687694,12,"If someone ran this guy through a scanner, the readout would say: “Mark down and stock in straight-to-video aisle."""
Hitman,6.3,39687694,10,"A Eurotrashy vidgame knockoff that misses its target by a mile. Numbingly unthrilling as it lurches from one violent encounter to another, the pic's dark roots in an electronic, non-dramatic medium are plain to see, and unsuspecting gamers lured to theaters will soon wish they were back home participating in the action themselves."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,80,"If ever there was a movie equivalent to the one-night stand this is it - not necessarily something you'll remember next day but fast, furious and damn good fun while it lasts."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,75,"The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that ""last action hero"" tried, and failed, to do."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,50,"The script is fueled by genuine wit, everyone turns in fine performances and, beginning to end, the film actually shows some thought, if little originality."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,40,Demolition Man is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre.
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,40,Ultimately the script's often sharp social satire is drowned out by the noise and confusion.
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,40,"Yes, this film is worse than ""Cliffhanger,"" Stallone's last venture into chaos."
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,38,Demolition Man is sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless.
Demolition Man,6.6,58055768,25,"Nearly all the SF premises are accorded the status of Andrew Dice Clay one-liners - which means that they, along with the characters, keep changing from one scene to the next."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Preposterous, predictable, but excessively entertaining, this frenzied thriller draws both story and characters from such action classics as ""The Fugitive,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs."""
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Con Air, a summer blast of a movie, teaches us many things: Producer Jerry Bruckheimer never met an explosion, a car crash or 20 tough guys talking trash he didn't like. Nicolas Cage is one of our most enjoyable screen heroes. As long as you're funny, you can literally get away with murder in a movie."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Director Simon West hits just the right note between self-conscious silliness and real dramatic intensity in this 1997 action thriller, which uses typecast actors to make the characters' one-liners and predictable behavior resonate."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,80,"Yes, disbelief is required not so much to be suspended as removed altogether, but it barely matters as this is an adrenaline blast of the highest order."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,75,"This is a movie that knows it is absurd, and does little to deny it."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,70,"Apart from not knowing to quit while it's ahead, Con Air provides quite an exciting flight prior to its crash and burn."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,70,"The colorfully written Con Air is a solid chip off ""The Rock,"" pumped up and very well cast, with the prettiness and polish of advertising art."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,70,"Numbing but not boring, it's finally more dispiriting than exhilarating, like a wild night of debauchery that leaves only a fearsome hangover for a souvenir."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,Con Air is entertaining in an extravagantly decadent sort of way. It just isn't a movie.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,"How's the movie? Big, loud, brutal and stupid, that's how it is. But then, you don't need a critic to tell you that -- anyone with a grade-school education who's seen the previews can figure that out."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,"This is a big, silly film. Is it full of explosions and one-liners? Of course. Is it entertaining? Of course."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,60,"Packed high with explosive action and loaded with high-stakes jeopardy, Con Air charts a generally sound narrative course, although it hits some story turbulence before it hits its climactic jackpot."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,The saving grace of Con Air is its sense of its own absurdity.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"This movie is a perfect example of what's wrong with many big-budget films today: no characters, no intelligence, and, worst of all, little fun."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,Mega-budget action extravaganzas don't get much sillier than this.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"From scene to scene, the tone shifts from supposed sincerity to arch and amused, until the picture begins to seem like some mad, desperate, scattershot attempt to hold an audience's attention from moment to moment, by any means."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"Director Simon West makes an impressive feature debut in this relentless action-comedy that is, more than anything else, about how funny it is to see hundreds of people exploded, shot, knifed, propellered and burnt to death, and how to land a plane on the crowded Vegas strip."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,50,"It's so shameless, so psychotically nervous about keeping you ''thrilled,'' that the phrase over the top won't do it justice. It's like a drug designed for people who've done every drug and now want to be jet-propelled into numbness."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,40,"There's nary a hint of suspense in West's film, though, mainly because he loudly trumpets the upcoming disasters so early in the film."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,38,Con Air has all the signs of a hit. That's depressing.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,25,"Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi are among the few performers who emerge with a shred of dignity at the end."
Con Air,6.8,101117573,20,Con Air is boring to the marrow.
Con Air,6.8,101117573,20,"While tyro director Simon West fills Con Air with all the slam-bang action and well-honed wisecracks that were the more positive qualities of its predecessors, the film brims even more with all their worst qualities."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,75,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice boils down to ""The Karate Kid"" meets ""Harry Potter,"" with maybe a dash of ""Ghostbusters"" to keep it interesting."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,75,A tamer tale of supernatural shenanigans that is far more appropriate for young children than the sometimes too-scary scenes from J.K. Rowling's stories.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,70,"Cage will likely not earn a second Oscar here, but he and director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) make leftovers into fine PG malarkey with their hokey naïveté and prankish hocus-pocus."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,70,"The tone is both goofier and darker than the Potter pictures, and some of the magic battles built around New York City landmarks are eye-popping; there's also a genuinely affecting romance between Baruchel and fetching newcomer Teresa Palmer."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,67,"Turteltaub has a workmanlike touch and an easy sense of humor here, and he and his team do a better-than-expected job of keeping you interested in the story, despite it being yet another Tale of a Reluctant Young Man With A Supernatural Hero's Calling."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,67,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice is too long, and it's ersatz magic, but at least it casts an ersatz spell."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,65,"Turteltaub strives to show us realistic-looking magic, without realizing he'd be better off if he acknowledged that there's no such thing. Instead, we get human figures that emerge ""magically"" from swarms of cockroaches and sorceresses who dissolve into dust particles right before our eyes. It's the best CGI money can buy, and who cares?"
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,63,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a perfectly typical example of its type, professionally made and competently acted."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,63,"The CGI is relentless and what you might call reverse-magical: The more we're hit with stuff, the less wondrous it becomes."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,63,"As fun as it is at times -- particularly early on -- the longer The Sorcerer's Apprentice goes on, the more the magic wears off."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,60,"Despite Cage in a snit, it's a likable if functional summer-show."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,60,Big and brash with a fantasia of battles and chases thrown in to keep the young ones enthralled for its nearly two-hour running time.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,60,"A frenetic, overstuffed but imaginative fantasy."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,58,"Baruchel aside, The Sorcerer's Apprentice contains a few minor delights. One is Cage's surprisingly low-key approach to a role that he could be expected to play over the top."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"A by-the-numbers, good-vs.-evil tale."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"A flavorless family-friendly action-adventure that doubles as memory exploitation. It has nothing to do with either the Mickey Mouse broom sequence of the same name from 1940's ""Fantasia'' or the 213-year-old Goethe poem that inspired it."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"On the whole, the movie is more Cheez Whiz than wizardly."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"While Mr. Molina and Mr. Cage supply a measure of well-compensated eccentricity, their labors ultimately serve to emphasize the grinding mediocrity of the enterprise."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"The lively verbal sparring between the good and evil sorcerer-apprentice pairs sustains the movie, but, with a predictable plot, by-the-numbers action-movie jolts and no real sense of wonder, The Sorcerer's Apprentice is really just a pumpkin."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"The movie isn't so much bad as it is formulaic and uninspired. In some ways, that might almost be a worse sin."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"Somewhere in recreational value between an afternoon on a San Diego beach and one at a Detroit public swimming pool. Either way, before you know it, it's evening."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"The lesson at the core of Goethe's poem -- that powerful spirits are not to be taken lightly, and should only be conjured by those who can control them -- goes out the window, and the mentor-student relationship gets swallowed up in the action. Bruckheimer may be the dark lord of Tinseltown, but he's the Mickey Mouse of this scenario, and the mops and brooms get the best of him."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,50,"Cage is amusingly skanky, Molina is dependably arch, and Baruchel is engagingly down to earth. But do we really need to watch them play out this exhaustingly empty scenario?"
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,42,"While both actors have been hammier and more hilarious, and neither one overdoes things enough to be notable, they at least seem to be having loads of flailing fun as they conjure up CGI scenery to chew on. And when Apprentice limits itself to their battle, it's generally fitful dumb fun."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,40,"""Apprentice"" lurches from one been-there-done-that sequence to another."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,40,The magic here feels machine-made and depressingly state-of-the-art.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,40,"Other than the Pottersploitation and presence of current It nerd Baruchel, this fantasy-action-comedy might have been spat out into multiplexes any summer over the previous two decades, yet it would seem like forgettable abracadabra filler regardless of the date."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"A generally joyless pastiche of sorcery history, imitation Potter ""chosen one"" Messianics and mirthless silliness, it's another in a string of recent black marks against Cage's Oscar-owning reputation."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"As Balthazar, Cage doesn't disappoint. He's just manic enough to keep the character from becoming too predictable."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"The movie is a clunky, noisy contraption. Director Jon Turteltaub piles on gadgets and devices in the hopes we'll be dazzled enough to miss the story's lack of coherence and charm."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,38,"This booming, cartoonish confection is a transparent attempt to take a property Disney owns rights to, and to try and create a Harry Potter-like franchise."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,30,If there were any brooms in Disney's new Sorcerer's Apprentice they would have to be used to sweep this tired dreck to the curb.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,25,"A two-hour trailer: explosion, shape-shift, chase, wisecrack, repeat. Its most amazing trick will be how it vanishes from your memory before the seat you vacate has stopped moving."
The Sorcerer's Apprentice,6.1,63150991,25,"Cage and Baruchel work hard to stay accessible, but the computer-generated effects come on like heavy artillery blowing away any hint of flesh and blood. The Sorcerer's Apprentice should be rated U for Untouched by Human Hands."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,100,"This is one perfectly terrifying movie, an instant classic."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,89,"Nearly a perfect film, from its bold and epic man-vs.-nature conflict to the breathless scripting, editing, acting, and direction."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,88,'Titanic'' was a case of a cheeseball story riding terrific effects. The Perfect Storm is in every important way deeper.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,88,"Accomplishes a delicate balancing act, that of entertaining the audience with the thrills and adventure of the Andrea Gail's final journey."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,88,A well-crafted example of a film of pure sensation. I do not mind admitting I was enthralled.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,80,"As a movie, this is exciting stuff."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,80,Scary and exciting.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"Dive right in if you're looking for an old-fashioned entertainment that delivers corny romance, turbulent action, and enough wave-churning seascapes to make ""Titanic"" seem landlocked."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"The problem with The Perfect Storm is that while its roiling collision of weather systems is pulled off with cinematic deftness, the actors who stand there getting lashed and splashed don't have anything terribly interesting to say."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,"Does about as good a job of simulating that terror as it possibly could, but it's no competition for what we create in our mind's eye while reading."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,Unabashedly designed to blow its audience away.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,75,Petersen's speculative reenactment makes for gripping summer entertainment -- if you don't mind a little corn floating in your brine.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,70,"Impersonal Hollywood filmmaking at its most paradoxical. It keeps you glued to your seat, and leaves no aftertaste whatsoever."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,70,"Has noticeable problems with characterization and dialogue. But once that awesome storm, one of the most terrifying ever put on film, gets cranked up, it's hard to remember what those difficulties were, let alone care too much about them."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,67,"The stick-figure people in the script haven't the slightest chance of making an impression, and you're more excited at the prospect of the next big wave?"
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,65,"The perfect example, of how the newest visual effects movies have the capacity to overwhelm everything--from actors to plotlines--except in the end, maybe, their audiences."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,"By the end, I felt like a beetle going round and round in a toilet bowl that just wouldn't stop flushing."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,So much water. Such a dramatic washout.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,"The movie is ""Twister"" on the high seas, a spectacular-looking, spectacularly hollow tale about foolhardy men vs. imperious nature."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,63,An enthralling special-effects tour de force with a lover's nook.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,60,The storm is the reason to see the movie.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,60,"Overall, the book is a far more rewarding experience than the movie."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,58,"Petersen gives us monumental images of waves and rain and wind, but the editing is so choppy that the images don't build and crest."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"But jaw-dropping trailer aside, there isn't much movie here."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,Rains on its own parade.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"Not terrible, but distinctly disappointing, not nearly as engaging or thrilling as its premise seems to promise."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"The Perfect Storm is no ""Titanic."""
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"The yarn's emotional undercurrents never take hold, resulting in a picture that leaves one thinking less about the fates of the characters than about how the actors had to spend most of their working days soaking wet."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"What's true about The Perfect Storm is true of many effects epics: it's not a bad movie, except for the people."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,Big effects; threadbare story.
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,50,"Once at sea, The Perfect Storm collapses in a heap of spectacle and a dubious piling-on of scary incidents."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"The whole thing is kitsch of the most pricey sort, and it's a good guess that it will be a smash."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"It may have been the perfect storm, but this is the imperfect movie."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,"Its spectacular special effects threaten to swallow characters whole, and there are times when overwrought and clumsy dialogue... nearly pitch you right out of the movie's mood."
The Perfect Storm,6.4,182618434,40,It's like a memorial service with killer special effects.
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,63,Go Ahead And Scoff. But This cheap-jack sequel to the 1982 cult favorite about a hunky scientist (Dick Durock) turned talking plant delivers more tacky hit-and-miss hilarity than a Cineplex-ful of teen-sex comedies.
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,"The movie is based on characters that originally appeared in DC Comics, and means to be funnier than it ever is. It almost achieves its comic goal in one scene in which Swamp Thing and Heather Locklear, as Mr. Jourdan's innocent stepdaughter, attempt to consummate a love that cannot be. The film is otherwise composed entirely of special effects that alternate with whimsy."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,"With its endless string of good-naturedly cheap jokes and its comic-book style, The Return of Swamp Thing is good campy fun, spoofing its horror premise effectively."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,"Apprenticed under Corman, Wynorski is well-versed in double-bluffing his audience, denying them the chance of balking at dreadful special effects by implying that the ineptitude is deliberate. He opts for cheap nostalgic laughs and camp '50s sci-fi scenery; depending on whether you find this funny, you'll either smile knowingly or gasp in disbelief."
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,50,The Return of Swamp Thing is scientific hokum without the fun. Second attempt to film the DC Comics character will disappoint all but the youngest critters.
The Return of Swamp Thing,4.6,192816,40,The world can only hope The Swamp Thing's abode is now bulldozered and turned into a shopping mall.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,75,"The movie flies by pleasantly, and is then instantly forgettable. Perhaps Jules Verne can explain the science of that."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"The second installment in a likable family franchise, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island makes a nice case to your kids that reading books is a good idea."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"It's a thoroughly family-friendly film, with a subtle message about the importance of father figures. Don't expect anything resembling believability, but enjoy the blend of strikingly colorful visuals and banter between odd couple Johnson and Caine, which combine for a mild escapist treat."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"Yes, The Mysterious Island is everything a 12-year-old boy could want – endless adventure involving a reckless adolescent hero, with a pretty girl in a clinging T-shirt around to watch him struggle."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,63,"This is transcendently goofy. It isn't a ""good"" movie in the usual sense (or most senses), but it is jolly and good-natured, and Michael Caine and Dwayne Johnson are among the most likable of actors."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,60,"If there's a book-loving adventuress or adventurer in your house younger than 10, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island provides a lighthearted break from the death-obsessed ""Harry Potter"" franchise and other literary but limp adventures like the ""Narnia"" films and ""The Lightning Thief."""
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,60,A fun though rarely funny family adventure whose lively special effects compensate somewhat for actors who largely sleepwalk through their roles.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,60,"Massively throwaway, but funnier and more likable than the first entry. Mainly that's due to an A-list pairing that's as inspired as it is demented."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"For all the special effects – like its predecessor, this is in 3-D – the film coasts on Johnson being charming and Caine being Caine."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"With cheesy-looking effects including a ride on the backs of giant bees and dubious literary references, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island comes dangerously close to giving books, never mind 3-D, a bad name."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"This kind of movie is all about the special effects. They start out great - cool helicopter crash, very convincing giant lizard - but grow more amateurish as the film goes along, with a flight sequence on giant bees proving particularly clunky."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"Surrogate fathers and family values are at the foreground, making the film a quick sell to parents - especially as it boasts the added value of literary roots."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"This is a family movie, after all -- but you'll have to sit through some abrasively broad, unfunny exchanges to get there. Dialogue, alas, is the kind of thing that can't be enhanced by the wearing of 3-D glasses."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"The look of the film is impressive, as are the effects. Overall, however, it's a big, loud, 3-D-drenched jumble."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,50,"As the band of adventurers skips from one supersized Survivor-like challenge to the next, one can't help feeling the creative potential of Verne's vision is wasted."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"The island locale rings with reggae music regardless of its proximity to Jamaica, and any action sequence is rendered in painfully deliberate slo-mo."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"Even ""Bwana Devil"" showed less crassness in its attempts to wow, however, and the more this cardboard blockbuster piles on the cut-rate F/X, the less anyone - the cast, the filmmaker, you - can muster up the energy to care."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"It's silly enough that young teens are unlikely to be drawn to it unless they've got a thing for Hudgens or want to take an early peek at Hutcherson, who will soon be seen as Peeta in ""The Hunger Games."" He was great as a sulky brat in ""The Kids Are All Right"" but in Journey 2 he comes across as wooden, dull and though not yet 20, too old for roles like these."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,40,"The film is endurable owing solely to Johnson, a veteran of bad kids' movies whose sense of when to dial up the charm in such a generic, soulless entertainment remains impeccable."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,38,Anyone old enough to have read Jules Verne or seen the way his work was successfully adapted in the past will suffer worse than the kids in the audience who just came to laugh.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,38,"Even by the unambitious standards of some children's movies and many movies that star Caine, this one has a difficult time making a case for itself as anything other than an adventure in baby-sitting."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,38,"Hutcherson spits his lines out as quickly as possible, which you appreciate, because the way the likable Johnson wrestles with his lines (""It looks like the liquefaction has tripled overnight!"") you think, well, it's a living."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,33,"This adventure strands Johnson's famously animated features in eyebrow jail, and squanders his outsized charisma and gift for winking self-deprecation in a thankless worried-stepfather role. It doesn't call for much, beyond a lot of muscles and an ever-present look of concern for his whiny stepson."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,30,The result is a goofy-weird mishmash of some pretty swell CGI creatures and some downright lousy screenwriting.
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,25,"For a time, Journey 2 becomes a lost episode of ""Lost,"" then it becomes ""King Kong,"" minus the ape. Then it becomes a ukulele music video featuring the Rock's take on Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's ""What a Wonderful World."""
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,25,"Prizes computer-generated wizardry above logical plotting or thoughtful character development, a misguided set of priorities exacerbated by the fact that said digital effects prove so chintzy."
Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,5.8,103860290,0,The movie's flexibility with its own rules would be less noticeable if it were busy thrilling us.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,67,"It may be mindless and sexless and humorless, but Jumper jumps."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,63,"Liman applies the same frenetic approach to action scenes that made ""The Bourne Identity"" such an engaging and exciting affair."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,60,"It’s Liman’s least charismatic action movie and the least developed, but it still packs some cracking action into its brief running time and lays foundations on which a great franchise could be built."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,58,I'll say this much for Jumper – it's got a great premise. Or at least the beginnings of a premise.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,It's a feature-length teaser for a never-to-be sci-fi franchise.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,The major weakness in Jumper is the piling on of action and narrative in the last ten to twelve minutes. It's as though the editor was rushing to meet a deadline and did the best he could with too much footage.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,Jumper proves disappointingly inert. All the state-of-the-art visual effects in the world can't compensate for spotty plotting and bland characters that prevent an intriguing premise from going the distance.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Director Doug Liman churns out a serviceable sci-fi thriller/videogame template that plays like ""The Matrix Lite"" and, finally, isn't nearly as cool as its trailer."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Liman, for all his craft, doesn't have enough FUN with the premise."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,Goes south as a sci-fi film.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"The whole production does reek a bit of origin story filminess, but even so, it's light sabers beyond Christensen's sad, revengeful fate in ""Episode III"" and does offer a nice view of the top of the Sphinx's head no less than three times."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"The best thing -- maybe the only good thing -- about the expensive sci-fi movie, Jumper, is its high-concept premise, which gives its hero the power of teleporting himself anywhere on the globe in the blink of an eye: from the Coliseum of Rome to the North Pole."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"The film LOOKS great, but at a brisk 88 minutes, there's no time to fill in back story, from the epic history of paladin persecution to the deeply personal mystery of David's mother, and the cliffhanger ending is so abrupt that the movie seems bizarrely truncated."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Woefully short on script, the picture ends up disappearing down the wormhole of its own premise."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"It doesn't help that the performances are bland (particularly those of Christensen and Bilson) and that what comes out of their mouths is uninspired. Short on imagination and anchored by a wan hero, Jumper is a flight of fancy that never fully takes off."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Though dazzled by its ultra-modern wizardry and the high gloss of its production values, one can also feel the globalist double standard roiling underneath the adolescent-kid fantasy plot. Jumper tells us that Americans fantasize about getting rich by stealing and going everywhere they want without restrictions; that they are materialistic, disrespect foreign antiquities, and remain blind to their own and to world history."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,Jumper is all high concept with little invested in characters or story.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"There's enough kinetic energy in Jumper to light a thousand houses. Unfortunately, there's no one home in any of them."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"But what can you do with Hayden Christensen? He's as close as we have to an android actor. It's all a chore for him. He never looks sufficiently scared, impressed, or surprised by any of this."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,"Fast is a good quality in an action/adventure. But there is lightning-paced and then there is warp speed. Doug Liman's Jumper is the latter, a not-so-good quality in an action/adventure for the simple reason that the audience can't figure out what's going on."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,50,It's difficult to know whom to root for.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,42,No exciting action can cover the film's profound shallowness and repulsive attitude toward everyone but Christensen.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,"Jumper, the film, goes everywhere and nowhere."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,Director Doug Liman and a trio of writers eventually forget the rules they set up and hurl combatants to places they could never have seen or even known about: Who'd willingly project himself into the middle of a Chechnyan war zone?
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,Deep into Hollywood's Dumb Season comes one of its dumbest offerings.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,38,These site-shifting extravaganzas sometimes reach an exhilarating level of near-abstraction. So it's too bad that just about everything surrounding the action scenes of the picture is such unmitigated cr--.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"The result is more or less a remake of the great scene in “Sherlock Jr.,” where a dozing Buster Keaton dreams himself through a shuffled sequence of backgrounds. Jumper is ten times as brutal, maybe a thousand times more costly, and eighty-four years late, but it’s a start."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"Jumper is so lame -- undernourished in its characterizations, stillborn in its action scenes -- that it inevitably leads the idled mind to wondering how this movie got past the pitch stage."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,Jumper is so in sync with the language of modern action movies that it’s possible to look past its soullessness and go with the quantum flow.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,A barely coherent genre mishmash.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"Jumper not only makes the rules up as it goes along; it neglects to tell us what those rules are, which is both unfair and unfun."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,30,"Like so many other CGI behemoths, this dull action fantasy ultimately squashes rather than inspires one's sense of wonder."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,25,"The best stuff in Jumper comes early, while the movie is still busy explaining its scenario. It's only when all the pieces are in place and the story actually kicks in that things start to fall apart, and quickly."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,25,A totally ridiculous and incoherent sci-fi adventure.
Jumper,6.1,80172128,25,"Talk about disappointing. Director Doug Liman exuded style and cool in ""Swingers,"" ""Go"" and ""The Bourne Identity."" He lost his way in the star bloat of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" and now his mojo is buried in this amped-up sci-fi chase flick."
Jumper,6.1,80172128,0,"Jumper, based on the novel by Steven Gould, re-defines -- downward -- the notion of dreadful. It does so by dispensing with everything a movie needs for a shot at being merely awful. Dramatic development? None. Entertaining dialogue? Ditto. Internal logic? Puhleez. Intriguing characters? No characters, thus no intrigue. Interesting performances? Essentially none, though with an asterisk."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,100,"RoboCop is no canned remake of the 1987 action film. It's a reimagining that responds to everything that has changed in American life over the past 27 years, addressing new threats and exploiting new anxieties."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,83,"As viscerally exciting as Padilha's RoboCop can be, the movie is elevated by serious considerations of the ethics of using robots as guardians (shades of drones), commercialism, playing God with science, and what being human is about."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,80,"Taking the original and successfully transplanting it into an ambitious new world, José Padilha’s english-language debut is an exciting, pacey and thoughtful sci-fi actioner."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,Jose Padilha's Robocop reboot does some of the things a good remake should do: it retains the central ideas and themes of the original while updating and rearranging the narrative to lose a derivative feel.
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,"This movie comes at you with an idea or two, as well as every available gun blazing."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,RoboCop is a solid near-future action pic that poses moral questions about artificial intelligence and remote-control combat systems without getting too preachy or ponderous about it.
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,"This RoboCop earns its stripes, mostly for the seriousness with which it treats its Frankenstein story."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,75,"RoboCop is topically up-to-the-moment but stylistically it’s retro. Far from using the story as an excuse to string together cheap thrills and blowout spectacle, its hero has all the heart of the Tin Man."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,70,It’s a rare “reboot” that transcends its studio’s money-grubbing. It has some Big Ideas.
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,70,"It’s a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era’s darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,67,"The film has lots of energized mayhem, and Murphy's unraveling of the conspiracy against him isn't dumbed down, yet it's as if the comic-book action poetry of the original has been encased in a suit of generic armor."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,67,"There are enough rough edges and interesting kinks across the two-hour running time that you come out forgiving it for the more generic elements, though we'll acknowledge that the flaws might stick out more on a second viewing, when you're not just pleasantly surprised that the whole thing isn't a stinking mess."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,66,"RoboCop has sound and fury to spare and even an inspired idea or two lurking beneath that polished exterior, but much like its upgraded namesake, this watchable mess ultimately lacks a prime directive to call its own."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,63,"Though this RoboCop can’t come close to capturing the clever-silly audacity of the original, one area in which the current film easily surpasses it is in the quality of the cast."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"It's well made, polished, and hits every mark — but is it crazy to want a futuristic sci-fi action flick about a motorcycle-riding metal supercop to be just a little more fun?"
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"A nicely cast, respectable remake."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"Every bit of it is more advanced: The actors are better, the plot is tighter, the special effects sleeker, the messages more heartfelt. Yet it lacks Verhoeven's bloody, biting scream."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"Thanks to a good cast and a willingness to stray fairly far afield from the source material, it’s better than you might think."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"This is a slicker, shinier, admittedly inferior affair. But with a strong cast, a roaring pace and at least one genuinely unforgettable scene, it’s by no means a write-off."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"The film is not only unchallenging, it seems actively scared of challenging us. You emerge feeling pacified and only semi-entertained."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,60,"In some ways, the thoughtful, dense script marks an improvement on the original, and the cast is certainly tonier this time around. What’s missing is the original’s evil wit, amoral misanthropy and subversive slipperiness."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Brazilian director José Padilha (Elite Squad, Bus 174) soldiers on stolidly, but lacks the Dutch Verheoeven's abiding sense of mischief."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Neither Alex Murphy’s internal moral conflict nor the larger, vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake, which raises the question of what is meant to be the point."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"What we’re left with is a teen-oriented action flick with an A-minus cast, a mixture of “Transformers”-style robot battles and cops-and-robbers showdown that never feels all that exciting or cutting-edge, bracketed by some intriguing and half-successful moments of social commentary."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"A faithful remake of RoboCop would be timely. Instead, the producers of this new version have retreated back to the lab, concocting a creaky hybrid of “Frankenstein” and “Call of Duty.”"
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Aggressively loud, terminally mediocre."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"The film doesn't embarrass itself or dishonor its predecessor, which is something."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Moviegoers are stuck with this sci-fi thriller's bland story, murky cinematography and frenetic special effects."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Although the movie isn't a complete disaster, it's not your father's RoboCop either."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,50,"Director Jose Padilha (the “Elite Squad” movies) knows how to create slick, sometimes clever fast-moving battle sequences... But other than Keaton’s Sellars, the bad guys are mostly generic nitwits."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"The result is fitfully interesting, and Mr. Kinnaman, best known for ""The Killing"" on television, compels our empathy with a kind of macho melancholia. Still, the whole thing comes down to an action adventure that's graphics-rich, logic-poor, coherence-challenged and pleasure-impaired."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"While retaining the core story of a bionic man tormented by the memory of his former human life, the film doesn’t play with the concept or give it new dimension. The whole enterprise raises the question: Why do filmmakers insist on remaking movies for no good reason?"
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"There’s no harmony at all to the elements tossed into the new remake of RoboCop, but credit screenwriter Joshua Zetumer and director José Padilha for at least having some elements in play."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"Any improvements over the original RoboCop are mere window dressing, more a superficial function of technical advances in filmmaking than of any sort of storytelling prowess or fresh narrative ideas."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,40,"There’s nothing wrong, of course, with sci-fi films asking Big Questions, but the delivery doesn’t have to be — should never be, in fact — this tedious."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,38,"Yes, the technology has improved in the 27 years that have passed. But the ensuing years have also produced first person shooter video games which utterly preclude the need for this as a movie. Visceral, violent toys that they are, they still have more heart than this."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,38,"Ultimately the film is, like the Faux News programming it caricatures at face value, a deck-stacking simulation of a dialogue it isn't even remotely interested in opening."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,25,"The main thing wrong with Robocop is that it's dumb, and it's trashy, and it's both of those things in a not-good way."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,25,"For all its playfulness, the new RoboCop can’t help but lack the novelty of the original’s jolting mixture of dumb-smart irony and visceral pulp."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,20,"The remake of the 1987 cult actioner Robocop is a misguided failure — not only because its retooled half-man/half-machine hero now has emotions, but also because its “fear the machines” message winds up feeling creaky."
RoboCop,6.2,58607007,20,"A deafening, boring action pile-up that is more Call of Duty than Robocop."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,100,"An expert, sensitive study of the fateful tie that inevitably binds the strong to the weak, this film may well be the best western of 1960."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,100,"Deep down, you know it's not as good as Seven Samurai — but few films are. You also know that next time it's on television, you'll find yourself watching it."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,100,"Well-crafted, star-driven entertainment doesn't come much better."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,91,"The basic outline was adapted from Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai and made into an American Western by one of the great innovators of the genre, John Sturges. The film led the way for other all-star cast outings."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,89,"Very nearly a classic, this Americanization of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai does a good job of mirroring the major themes and attitudes of the original while re-creating that monumental film in an occidental setting."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,80,The Magnificent Seven fights an uphill battle in matching the scope and thrills of its source material.
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,75,"Until the women and children arrive on the scene about two-thirds of the way through, The Magnificent Seven is a rip-roaring rootin' tootin' western with lots of bite and tang and old-fashioned abandon."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,70,"Sturges' remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is always worth a look, mainly for the performances of McQueen, Bronson, Coburn and Vaughn."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,70,"What was wonderful in the Kurosawa film—the recruiting and training of the mercenaries—is just dead time here, though the icon-heavy cast helps out: Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, and Robert Vaughn."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,60,"About two-thirds of the film is good, tough, unromantic period western. About one-third is sentimental nonsense and it bushwhacks the remainder."
The Magnificent Seven,7.8,4905000,60,"A gifted director like Mr. Sturges (who also produced) can't be held entirely responsible for this endless dawdling prologue, since William Roberts' scenario increasingly flattens the action with philosophical talk on all sides and some easy clichés."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"A silly, if fun, futuristic sci-fi romance."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"The Host will make perfect sense to 12-year-old girls, while their college-age sisters will probably laugh themselves sick and their mothers will look at Hurt and wonder when he got so old."
The Host,5.9,26627201,63,"The Host is top-heavy with profound, sonorous conversations, all tending to sound like farewells. The movie is so consistently pitched at the same note, indeed, that the structure robs it of possibilities for dramatic tension."
The Host,5.9,26627201,60,"The Host gets bogged down in its “who’s kissing whom now?” dynamics, and it becomes all too easy to snicker at it."
The Host,5.9,26627201,60,"An ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" retread told from a postoccupation vantage point, this adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s YA romance novel unfolds in a dystopian future when alien parasites have nearly won the battle for Earth."
The Host,5.9,26627201,58,"The Host is a step up from the endless metaphorical lectures and gaping plot holes of Niccol’s last film, In Time, but its muffled emotions, delivered with Twilight-esque blank-eyed calm, put it in the same category of a creative idea hamstrung in execution."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"As with the Twilight series, The Host's infelicities—drab dialogue, ridiculous plotting, more emotional crises than there is story—are enlivened by its thematic eccentricities."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,Saoirse Ronan's talents are wasted on a foolish dual part in this dull sci-fi fantasy.
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"There's something about novelist Stephenie Meyer that induces formerly interesting directors to suddenly make films that are slow, silly and soporific."
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,Extravagantly silly but undeniably entertaining sci-fi soap opera.
The Host,5.9,26627201,50,"'Twilight' of the Body Snatchers, without much urgency or sexual heat."
The Host,5.9,26627201,42,"The Host doesn't strive for social allegory, as previous body snatcher flicks have done with the Red Scare, civil rights and Watergate. If anything it's merely a teenage girl's fantasy checklist for prom."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"This film adaptation feels like YA, with cat’s-cradle love matches, soft-focus sexuality, and a main character who never satisfactorily makes the transition from page to screen."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"Niccol and Meyer -- who co-produces this, her first post-""Twilight"" film -- choose to trade away any shred of the ripe social subtext that has made other body-snatcher films so rich. In its place: the kind of supernatural, star-crossed romance that generates so much swooning from Team ""Twilight."""
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"Watch closely and you might even spy a better film inside, straining to break free."
The Host,5.9,26627201,40,"The movie, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer of “Twilight” fame and directed by Andrew Niccol, is just kind of dumb. Like the more famous books and movies, about a love triangle between a vampire, a werewolf and a human girl, it often plays like a teenage girl’s idea of how literary romances play out."
The Host,5.9,26627201,38,"To work, The Host would have required a visionary interpretation rather than the mundane telling that Niccol opts for."
The Host,5.9,26627201,38,"The Host basically comes down to a vote for Team Jared or Team Ian. I voted myself into oblivion about half an hour in. Niccol, who once added mystery and suspense to the sci-fi of 1997's ""Gattaca,"" is no match for the giant marshmallow that is The Host."
The Host,5.9,26627201,37,It’s a mushy and unsuspenseful melodrama.
The Host,5.9,26627201,30,"The story goes slack onscreen, so much so that the movie's two-plus hours will seem an eternity."
The Host,5.9,26627201,30,"Dopey, derivative and dull, The Host is a brazen combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes, young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation. That sounds like it should work (really!), but it never does, largely because the story is as drained of energy as are its moony aliens."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"Ronan, youthfully elegant as always, tries hard, but the material defeats her."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"Its title, very graciously, doesn't end with a ""Part 1,"" but The Host sure has enough plot points and ideas to fill two installments."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"A long, tedious and often unintentionally hilarious adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s sci-fi follow-up."
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,An invasion of the body snatchers is preferable to realizing that the true horror perpetrated here is not on the characters but on the audience.
The Host,5.9,26627201,25,"The film may as well be titled ""Stephenie Meyer's Waiting Around."""
The Host,5.9,26627201,20,"Steven Spielberg famously retained his childhood sense of wonder. On this evidence, Meyer has maintained a nine-year-old's notion of titillating romance."
The Host,5.9,26627201,0,It's really a dramatic sinkhole.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,100,"A great American movie about the greatness of ordinary Americans, Patriots Day combines an electrifying manhunt with the intimacy and feel for character writer-director Peter Berg showed in his brilliant TV series “Friday Night Lights.”"
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,91,"Berg’s approach is blunt and effective. With Patriots Day, he’s made an action film that grabs you by the throat and doesn’t let up."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,88,"Overall, this is a Boston Strong film about one of the worst terrorist attacks ever on American soil, and a community’s resounding response."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,83,"Like Lone Survivor and Deepwater Horizon before, Patriots Day is a brawny procedural, more than the exploitation flick it could be. Berg and Wahlberg's commitment to details beyond death and destruction feels like a calling."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"Still, it’s one of the terrorist's wives (Melissa Benoist) who carries the film’s most riveting and provocative scene."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"Patriots Day, muscular and confident, falls right in line with Berg’s other work. And you might feel a little dirty after watching it, as if you’d been granted access to real-life suffering and tragedy that perhaps should have remained private."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"Formally, Berg's film is at its root a police procedural, albeit an exceptionally well-executed one."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"The hurtling action, speaking louder than any dialogue, gives a stirring sense of the suffering and heroism that flowed from the terror at the Boylston Street finish line."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"An effective, efficient and quite dramatic examination of the events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three and injured 264, Patriots Day is a tribute to people who earned it: the investigators and first responders who ensured that a horrible situation did not become even worse."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,"It’s genuinely exciting megaplex entertainment, informed by extensive research, featuring bona fide movie stars, and staged with equal degrees of professionalism and respect."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,80,There’s little doubt who the hero of Peter Berg’s retelling of the 2013 Boston marathon bombings is: the city itself.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"A taut, riveting police procedural that maintains suspense even as it finds humor in the people, their funny accents and way with profanity, and pathos."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,Berg also creates one scene that should stand as an all-time classic: a residential street standoff between the Tsarnaevs and members of the Boston and neighbouring Watertown police departments.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"Far from being exploitative, Patriots Day honors the Bostonians who responded to terrorism with strength."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"As with all of Berg’s films, Patriots Day does an excellent job with sets and locales and is compulsively watchable."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"For all its rough edges and gruesome touches, Patriots Day is a heartfelt and ambitious attempt to turn mayhem into something that’s emotionally valid."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"In other hands, Patriots Day could have been a paint-by-the numbers action thriller, but strong performances and well-paced momentum make it an engrossing watch."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"The question is, How big an audience is ready to relive the horror of a tragedy so close to home, especially in the light of the terrorist attacks that continue to assault our senses daily?"
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"Berg's unquestioning faith in law and order could have used, well, a little questioning. But there's no doubt about the worth of the movie as a well-earned tribute to the heroes and victims of a tragic event that may have just made Boston stronger."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"The movie, none too revelatory, mostly just stands as a sturdy thriller, one that’s more fleet than flat-footed as it shuttles among a veritable network of characters and story lines."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"As long as Patriots Day is concerned with recreating the sense of ambient chaos among sparring investigators and an anxious community, it’s immersive and thrilling."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,75,"Historians, media scholars and even Boston citizens may debate whether this is the most worthy way to honor those fallen in the attacks. But Berg mounts a heartfelt, harrowing tribute to the film’s real-life heroes."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"Patriots Day is a well-meaning, well-executed movie that tells the story of the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013 as a crime thriller — an interesting choice that works well, for the most part."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"With Patriots Day, Peter Berg translates national tragedy to cinema screens with power and purpose for the second time this year – yet the question for many is with wounds still healing, do we really need to be subjected to recreations of a hateful act still fresh in our nation’s history?"
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"My reservations about such pictures in general were not put to rest by Patriots Day, but this film’s real merits are not easily dismissed either."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"Like the heroic Bostonians it celebrates, civilians and law enforcement both, Peter Berg’s Patriots Day gets the job done."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,70,"As a retelling of a tragedy that had its moments of heroism among uniformed personnel and indefatigable civilians alike, it gets the job done."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,67,"The film, which swivels frantically between first responders, survivors, and investigators, has a percussive force, but its best scene, unbearably tense, is a quiet one, when a Chinese app designer (an excellent Jimmy O. Yang) is carjacked by the Tsarnaev brothers."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,67,"Patriots Day benefits from a robust, concentrated timeline and sheer bat-out-of-hell pacing."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,63,"If you’re looking for great, realistic action, it’s just the thing. Berg is a masterful action director, and his Patriots Day is every bit as engaging and exciting as ""Lone Survivor"" and ""Deepwater Horizon."""
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,63,"After dispensing with the sluggish setup of the film’s first act, Berg shifts into high gear, powerfully evoking the feelings of dread and white-knuckle excitement that much of America no doubt felt as the manhunt progressed."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,63,The hero worship of a fictional character in the midst of all of this real-life drama is a mistake.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,"Patriots Day is stirring, well-acted, moving and built with conviction and flair. But a film about such a senseless attack shouldn’t be scared, now and then, to make a little less sense."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,"The third part of Berg’s unofficial Americans-in-crisis trilogy will play better for US audiences than overseas, but it’s still a pacy and often enthralling disaster movie."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,Wahlberg may have succeeded in singlehandedly cracking the case and bringing the perpetrators to justice but — like the film itself—he fails to find meaning in the wreckage.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,60,"As exciting as the film may be, Berg too easily undercuts the human element of his story."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"Patriots Day sits right on the line between exploitation and tribute. The star power is dicey, and the action relentless, but Berg means well and likes the people in his recount."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"So the bottom line: This is an undeniably effective movie that I mostly enjoyed, even though I’m not altogether sure it should ever have been made."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"To its credit, the film doesn’t linger unnecessarily over the horrors, and quickly turns into a police procedural. As the FBI takes over the investigation from the local authorities and sets up a command center, the details of this process are fascinating to observe."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"At best, it's unnecessary. At worst, it's vaguely insulting."
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,It works so hard to evoke a sense of teary patriotism it leaves behind a grimy feeling.
Patriots Day,7.4,31886361,50,"Patriots Day may, in fact, embrace the spirit of the days following the bombing, but the scattered framing leaves one wanting more."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,88,"A dizzying lowlife saga that’s fast, smart, wicked, sort of ambitious and blazingly ironic. It’s as unpredictable as a Lindsay Lohan drive to the grocery store, as overstuffed as the pictures on Anthony Weiner’s Twitter feed and as hilarious as me on the bench press."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"In telling a true story about hapless thugs who are the embodiment of Michael Bay fans, the director has made the most fiendishly enjoyable movie of his career."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,It's funny as hell at times with a twisted sense of humor that one typically expects from the likes of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"This is easily Bay’s best movie, the work of a filmmaker with a cracked sense of humor that he is able to share with the audience."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"Even though Pain & Gain does indeed mine laughs from some very violent acts, there is nothing in this movie that glamorizes those three meatheads. Kudos to Bay and his screenwriters for making sure we’re laughing at them, not with them."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,75,"With Pain & Gain, his surprising true-crime comedy, Bay has finally decided to lighten up a bit."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,Pain & Gain gives you a rush while at the same time making you queasy about how you’re getting off.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,Michael Bay sends a clear message to those of us who've been making fun of him: He's been in on the joke the whole time.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,70,"It's like a giant sculpture that is so strange and off-putting, it's instantly, intriguingly post-modern. Swept up in the film's pile-driving self-assurance, even Bay-haters may absorb the pain to enjoy the gain."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,"As ambitious and vibrant as it is ugly and scattershot, Pain & Gain is the most charming Michael Bay movie in a long while."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,An outrageous based-on-real-life tale that's perfectly suited to director Michael Bay's insanely overblown stylistic and thematic temperament.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,63,"It’s just too much — too much graphic violence, too many plot wrinkles, too much stupidity, too many supporting players to track...For a movie as physically fit as this one wants to be, Pain & Gain is carrying way too much extra weight."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,The movie needed some more detachment – and brevity – but Wahlberg shows once again he has the comedy chops.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"The ever-present air of madcap, goofball insanity carries it through. A seriously guilty pleasure."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"Michael Bay goes back to a Bad Boys budget and a big boys’ rating, for a true-life crime story that’s inconsistent and frenetic, but also funny and wilfully outrageous."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,"Like all of Bay’s work, it’s over-the-top, brash and exhausting to watch. But like the lifestyle its characters aspire to, there’s an allure too."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,Wahlberg and Johnson are the saving graces of an in-your-face movie.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,60,It all leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"A day and half after walking out with a sensation, primarily, of physical relief—at two hours and nine minutes, Pain & Gain makes for a long, loud, relentlessly assaultive sit—I find that my thumb is wavering at half-mast. I’m still not sure whether to mildly like or mildly hate this movie."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,Nobody in it seems to possess a nervous system.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,The script’s occasional gestures toward making this an allegory of the failed American dream are extremely unconvincing in the context of a movie that revels in the excesses of macho culture while laughing at the hapless and stupid who can’t get it right.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"That sense of extreme, excess, over-the-top everything is there from start to finish. And isn't that what Bay fans count on even at cut-rate prices?"
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"A badly constructed, blood-spattered caper that comes unglued early on."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Yep, it's all fun and games until someone gets brutalized repeatedly. Before you can avert your eyes, it's Katie, bar the door and break out the chain saws."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,Bay blankets the film in a tone of smug self-awareness that obscures everything but its bald hypocrisy.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"There’s a certain kinetic charm to the first half of the movie, a freewheeling silliness to these outsized characters that makes you curious to see just how wrong things will go. But as the weightlifters’ plot spirals out of control, so does the movie’s."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Yes, the canon invoked for this film is that of the Three Stooges, but it’s still not as magnificently berserk as they can be. Set your expectations carefully for this one."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"Bay can be a master of exuberant chaos, but here the violence mostly lands with a sickening thud, which is fitting, one supposes, but also ultimately numbing."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,50,"The movie's best performance — and worst defamation — belongs to Tony Shalhoub, playing the first victim as a conniving, egotistical jerk who deserves to be kidnapped, maimed and ruined financially."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,42,"This is a tragedy, not a comedy."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,40,"When the story runs off the rails and crashes headfirst into a too-perfect ending, it's because Bay was led astray by the same things that got the Sun Gym Gang into this mess in the first place: superficiality, ambition, and the belief that reality just isn't good enough."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,40,"It's Bay World. And after an hour of Pain & Gain, it felt more like ""Pain & Pain."""
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,38,Pain & Gain fails at being an entertaining and ridiculously fun Michael Bay movie and curdles into something much more tone deaf and obnoxious.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,33,"The whole thing is played for laughs that almost never come. To be sure, the film has its moments, but they’re few and far between."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Bay seems to have been gunning for something along the lines of ""Blood Simple"" or ""A Simple Plan,"" but Pain & Gain is just plain simple."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Pain & Gain, a jokey but fatally tone-deaf true-crime caper, plays like “Fargo” for idiots."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"Any pretensions of satire, moral ambiguity, or social commentary get lost in a hurricane of empty, mindless spectacle."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,25,"It would be kind to call this satire; what it comes off as is a pummeling, testosterone-fueled sensory assault that the film then makes minor variations on for two very long hours."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,20,The story is told in a hammer-on-anvil manner that evinces no gift for social satire or sharp cultural insight.
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,20,"In between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim, Bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh. Pain and Gain is personal all right. You leave these characters with the distinct impression that they're Bay's kind of people."
Pain & Gain,6.4,49875291,12,"Michael Bay's absurdist comedy is all pain, no gain and an utter monstrosity. It may be the most unpleasant movie I've ever seen, and I'm not forgetting ""Freaks,"" which Pain & Gain resembles, come to think of it."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,75,"A moment's patience is soon rewarded by Anderson's vast store of rich, intoxicating imagery."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,60,"Stupid, with three o's. But also fun, never boring, and never insulting (to anyone other than Dumas) - unlike certain of the summer's A-pics…"
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,50,"It floats, but it's mainly filled with hot air."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,50,"Trash-action director Paul W.S. Anderson's (Alien vs. Predator) finds no cultural purpose for this rather literal adaptation of the Musketeers, but it's not so horrible it deserved to be protected from the cold eye of film critics."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,50,"A very 2011 take on Alexandre Dumas' classic that feels weirdly dated already. Although adequately entertaining thanks to lavish production values and game supporting perfs, this anodyne adaptation lacks a killer hook that would help it cross over to a demographic beyond action buffs and fanboys."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,42,"Beyond being unable to decide what kind of Musketeers movie it wants to be, Anderson's adaptation seems determined to underachieve as both heavy spectacle and light adventure. It's two mediocrities for the price of one."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,40,"Still, once you accept Paul W.S. Anderson's entirely unnecessary adaptation on its own terms (nonsensical, underachieving), it has its limited charms, which include a snigger-inducing alphabet soup of accents, a standout rooftop swordfight, and British comedian James Corden as the Musketeers' put-upon manservant."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,40,"Muskets and swords are a bit old-fashioned for the director of ""Resident Evil"" - Paul W.S. Anderson has added flying battleships and elaborate diamond heists. (With material as shopworn as this, an anachronizing approach seems as valid as any.)"
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,40,3D swashbuckler wields a disappointingly blunt sword.
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,38,"All the borderline pantomime acting and wigged buffoonery is deliberate and silly, but The Three Musketeers remains charmless, a romp brought down by its lead-footed script."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,35,"It's not the addition of airships and male dangly earrings that make Paul W.S. Anderson's take on Alexandre Dumas' classic, much-adapted adventure such a drag, it's everything else - the incoherence, the anvil-heavy dialogue, the lack of anything beyond the broadest of characterizations."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,30,The campy new screen adaptation of The Three Musketeers has all the reality and visceral excitement of a $75 million literary theme park dotted with fancy villages heavily patrolled by security.
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,30,"This one is overblown, over-dressed, and grandiosely dopey, packed with gargantuan sets and ludicrous action scenes and shot in unusually dark and dingy 3-D."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,25,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime fiasco, an epic fail like none we have seen this year, a bad idea by a very bad director and a career-crippling credit for all concerned. You don't want to miss it."
The Three Musketeers,5.8,20377913,25,This latest version is le pits.
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,90,"Big Trouble in Little China is a far more enjoyable mash-up of classic Westerns, Saturday-morning serials, and Chinese wu xia than any of the Indiana Jones movies, with Kurt Russell in full bloom as Carpenter’s de rigueur hard-drinkin’, hard-gamblin’, wise-crackin’ loner hero—a bowling-alley John Wayne."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,83,"There are two kinds of people: the ones who have seen — and love — Big Trouble in Little China, a John Carpenter kung fu Western buddy Chinese ghost love story, and those poor saps who aren’t burdened with having to try and describe it to the uninitiated."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,80,"What matters is the stunts and the spirit, and this latest set of exotic exploits of an indomitable hero (Kurt Russell) and a spunky heroine (Kim Cattrall) gives good value."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,70,"Big Trouble is plenty conscious of its silliness, which it embraces fully. It sets up its own parameters of ridiculousness and then runs with them, winking a little, but sticking to its story."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,60,"It falters a little in its confusing climactic battle, but is breathlessly paced, wittily scripted, amusingly played, action-packed and relentlessly spooky."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,60,"Carpenter has always been a skilful genre mechanic, breathing life into old forms; if he stubs his toes up against the bamboo curtain this time, there is still more enjoyable sly humour than in most slug-fests."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,60,"Written and directed in a campy, tongue-in-cheek style, it's a loving homage to those wild imports from Hong Kong--kung-fu movies."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,50,"The first 30 minutes of the movie gave me lots of room for hope. It was fast-moving, it was visually spectacular, it was exotic and lighthearted and filled with a spirit of adventure. But then, gradually, the movie began to recycle itself. It began to feel as if I was seeing the same thing more than once."
Big Trouble in Little China,7.3,11100000,50,Director John Carpenter seems to be trying to make an action-adventure along the lines of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The effect goes horribly awry.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,91,Director Mark Waters does a fine job meshing the fantastical with the quotidian.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,88,A well-crafted family thriller that is truly scary and doesn't wimp out.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"Not great fantasy, but it's on more solid ground than ""The Golden Compass"" and will seem less baffling to some. There's enough here to keep adults engaged, which is an important component of any motion picture that wants to be known as ""family entertainment."""
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,A fast-moving adventure with more than dynamic glitz to recommend it.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"A mostly superb cast, superior special effects, a sparkling musical score and a fantasy-filled plot ."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"The film underscores the power of reading, and applying what we read to problem-solving. The story suggests that we don't really see the natural world around us, and if we did our lives, like Jared's and his siblings', would be immeasurably richer."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,75,"The movie is funny and scary and touching in all the ways the best children's pictures are, but it is also fast and compact, running a perfectly paced 93 minutes (including credits)."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,An enjoyable adventure fantasy that pushes all the requisite buttons while still managing to throw in a pleasant surprise or two.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"A work of both modest enchantment and enchanting modesty, grounded in a classically Spielbergian realm where childlike wonderment crosses paths with the tough realities of young adulthood."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"The movie's richly autumnal look is by swift turns cozily naturalistic and terrifyingly baroque, and director Mark Waters (Freaky Friday, Mean Girls) sustains the balance between real and surreal with mischievous brio."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,Suffers slightly from that not-so-fresh feeling.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"Meticulously rendered CGI creatures--from Arthur Rackham-esque flower sprites to a troll that could have sprung from ""Jurassic Park""--spike this dark adventure, shot marvelously by Caleb Deschanel."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"The children's real world, or what passes for real in a fantasy, could hardly be more inviting, for reasons that are hardly mysterious: the strong performances, under Mark Waters's accomplished direction; the smart, bright language, much of it taken from the books; the stylish cinematography, by Caleb Deschanel."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,70,"A decent entertainment -- not up there with the ""Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings"" sagas, but a notch above ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Narnia."""
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,67,"Spiderwick is set in the present, but goes for an overall design look of dainty, cozy, William Morris-y arts-andcraftiness."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,67,"Anyone looking for handsomely presented, kid-friendly thrills need look no further."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,67,"Starts off promisingly by empathetically depicting the fear and anger children feel when their parents separate, but ultimately its human emotions are dominated by goblins, trolls, and other CGI-generated creatures running amok on the screen."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,63,"Unlike Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" which was also inspired by Rackham, The Spiderwick Chronicles is more whimsical than scary."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,63,"We're supposed to be agog at the fantastical creatures and dazzling special effects. But the more wrenching story of disillusioned children nags in the background, distracting from any enchantment."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,63,"A world designed for children, and most of the grownups involved don't quite understand it - on or offscreen."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,63,"It's a good movie for its type, but it rarely stops to let us marvel at the world it creates."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,63,"Perhaps Highmore could have tried a little harder to make us doubt for a moment that, once again, Good will inevitably overcome Evil."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,60,"Once “Spiderwick” gets to the fantasy, the story gets going."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,60,"A late entry in a crowded field, Spiderwick works hard to set itself apart from the competition, and almost entirely succeeds - no mean feat these days."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,58,"Maybe it's fantasy fatigue, but for all the pretty effects and breathless chases and goblin war battles, the sense of wonder and magic is lost in the shuffle."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,Spiderwick. There’s nothing wrong with it that passion and personality couldn’t fix.
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,"The obvious product of a corporate search for the next great fantasy franchise, this adaptation of the first in a series of popular children's books by the writer-illustrator team of Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi is a lump of leaden whimsy."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,"Overrun with malicious goblins, a vengeance-minded pig, a fast-moving troll and a giant horned ogre, but the true source of terror is scarier than all of these combined: New York real estate prices."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,50,"For the uninitiated? Man, it's a bummer."
The Spiderwick Chronicles,6.6,71195053,40,"Instead of the kind of inspired imaginative synergy that distinguished the “Lord of the Rings” and later “Harry Potter” pictures, this movie, directed by Mark Waters (“Mean Girls”), feels more like a sloppy, secondhand pander."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,88,"After Earth is ultimately too thin of a story to support all of its grandiose embellishments, but so what? It's better to try to pack every moment with beauty and feeling than to shrug and smirk. The film takes the characters and their feelings seriously, and lets its actors give strong, simple performances."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"That there are no surprises (jumps, yes, surprises, no) should surprise no one – Will Smith movies must uplift the human spirit and reaffirm our best instincts while reassuring us that our ticket money has been well invested."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"In truth, despite more corn than Mel Gibson grows on his farm in ""Signs"" (another Shyamalan effort), After Earth is worth a look."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,63,"Won't change your world, but it's attractive and Smith the Elder, lowering his voice to subterranean James Earl Jones levels, delivers a shrewd minimalist performance. His son may get there yet."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,60,"Jaden Smith takes centre stage in a futuristic rites of passager that plays like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. Although ""Oblivion"" narrowly remains this summer’s better ruined-Earth actioner."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,58,"The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,58,"Shyamalan’s sensibility may not be enough to turn After Earth into a great (or even very good) film, but it does yield interesting — and at times strikingly realized — results."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"Though it's meant to be pulse-pounding, After Earth is a lethargic slog."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"There’s nothing more to this movie than the set-up. Even though Cypher is slowly bleeding to death, and Kitai is running out of oxygen capsules that allow him to breathe in the toxic air, there’s no sense of urgency, either. At least Shyamalan, sensing the thinness of the material, doesn’t stretch things out."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"M. Night Shyamalan has directed movies that are surprising, hokey, suspenseful, sentimental, clever, touching or cheesy. But until After Earth, he hadn’t made any that are dull from end to end."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,50,"The film progresses to the point where it feels less like father and son, and more like a young boy listening to an inspirational audiobook."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,42,"It’s impossible to take this movie seriously, certainly not as seriously as it takes itself."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,42,"The plot is simplicity itself, and Jaden's quirk-free character and bland performance don't add anything. It's actually a little sad that M. Night Shyamalan has descended to this sort of vanity-project work-for-hire, but at least he didn't insist on some absurd twist ending."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"Despite the Smith family’s association with Scientology, which unmistakably informs this tale’s belief system (“Fear is a Choice”), as well as its shaky attempts at mythic patterning, it is in no way the laughable shambles that John Travolta’s infamous ""Battlefield Earth"" was."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"Prepare to cringe and snicker whenever the characters are talking, but gasp when Shyamalan just shows amazing stuff."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"In his defense, the kid is saddled with a task that even a more experienced actor might have trouble pulling off: He must carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders, given little more to act opposite than a succession of green-screen predators. Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots, Jaden can’t turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"What undoes the film is its rather rancid parent-child sentimentality (a Shyamalan staple, admittedly) and a charisma-free performance from the younger Smith that suggests the apple has fallen very far from the tree."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The jolts are of the jump-out-from-behind-the-door variety; you can see them coming from a long way off, too. Shyamalan seems to no longer have the confidence to let audiences figure things out or the patience to allow them to."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,This would be a difficult film even for the charismatic Papa Smith to carry. That he spends nearly the entire movie in a chair doesn't help matters.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The disappointingly generic film, which strands a father and son on Earth a thousand years after a planet-wide evacuation, will leave genre audiences pining for the more Terra-centric conceits of ""Oblivion,"" not to mention countless other future-set films that find novelty in making familiar surroundings threatening."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,40,"The film is repetitive and not as suspenseful at it tries to be. Often gorgeous, sometimes fascinating, it is ultimately unwieldy and unsurprising. It fails as a Smith-family project. Jaden Smith, who was fine in ""The Karate Kid,"" is flat here."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,38,The art of storytelling is both of distinct narrative interest and personal issue in the latest payload of calcified nonsense from one of modern cinema's oddest would-be auteurs.
After Earth,4.8,60522097,38,"An undemanding, childish adventure picture."
After Earth,4.8,60522097,35,"A disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition, After Earth doesn't play to the strengths of any of its major participants."
